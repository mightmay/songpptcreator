    <verse1>Christ is my reward. And all of my devotion. Now there's nothing in this world. That could ever satisfy.</verse1>
    <prechorus1>Through every trial. My soul will sing. No turning back. I've been set free.</prechorus1>
    <chorus>Christ is enough for me. Christ is enough for me. Everything I need is in You. Everything I need.</chorus>
    <verse2>Christ my all in all. The joy of my salvation. And this hope will never fail. Heaven is our home.</verse2>
    <prechorus2>Through every storm. My soul will sing. Jesus is here. To God be the glory.</prechorus2>
    <bridge>I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. The cross before me. The world behind me. No turning back. No turning back.</bridge>
