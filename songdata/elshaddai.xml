    <chorus>El-Shaddai, El-Shaddai, El-Elyon na Adonai. Age to age You're still the same. By the power of the name. El-Shaddai, El-Shaddai, Erkahmka na Adonai. We will praise and lift You high, El-Shaddai.</chorus>
    <verse1-1>Through Your love and through the ram. You saved the son of Abraham. Through the power of Your hand. Turned the sea into dry land.</verse1-1>
    <verse1-2>To the outcast on her knees. You were the God who really sees. And by Your might. You set Your children free.</verse1-2>
    <verse2-1>Through the years You made it clear. That the time of Christ was near. Though the people couldn't see. What Messiah ought to be.</verse2-1>
    <verse2-2>Though Your Word contained the plan. They just would not understand. Your most awesome work was done. Through the frailty of Your Son.</verse2-2>
