    <verse1>Think about His love, think about His goodness. Think about His grace that's brought us trough. For as high as the heavens above. So great is the measure of our father's love. Great is the measure of our Father's love. So great is the measure of our Father's love.</verse1>
    <verse2>How could I forget His love. And how could I forget His mercies. He satisfies, He satisfies, He satisfies my desires.</verse2>
