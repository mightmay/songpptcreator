<english>
    <verse1>Amazing grace. How sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind, but now I see.</verse1>
    <verse2>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear. And grace my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed.</verse2>
    <verse3>The Lord has promised good to me. His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be. As long as life endures.</verse3>
    <verse4>The earth shall soon dissolve like snow. The sun forbear to shine. But God, Who called me here below, Will be forever mine. Will be forever mine. You are forever mine.</verse4>
    <chorus>My chains are gone. I've been set free. My God, my Savior has ransomed me. And like a flood His mercy reigns. Unending love, amazing grace.</chorus>
