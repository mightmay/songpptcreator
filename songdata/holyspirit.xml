    <verse1>There's nothing worth more,that will ever come close. Nothing can compare, You're our living hope. Your Presence (Lord)</verse1>
    <verse2>I've tasted and seen, of the sweetest of Loves. Where my heart becomes free, and my shame is undone. In Your Presence (Lord)</verse2>
    <chorus>Holy Spirit You are welcome here. Come flood this place and fill the atmosphere. Your Glory God is what our hearts long for. To be overcome by Your Presence Lord.</chorus>
	<bridge>Let us become more aware of Your Presence. Let us experience the Glory of Your Goodness.</bridge>
