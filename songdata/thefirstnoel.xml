    <verse1>The First Noel, the Angels did say. Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay. In fields where they lay keeping their sheep. On a cold winter's night that was so deep.</verse1>
    <verse2>They looked up and saw a star. Shining in the East beyond them far. And to the earth it gave great light. And so it continued both day and night.</verse2>
    <verse3>And by the light of that same star. Three Wise men came from country far. To seek for a King was their intent. And to follow the star wherever it went.</verse3>
    <verse4>This star drew nigh to the northwest. O'er Bethlehem it took its rest. And there it did both Pause and stay. Right o'er the place where Jesus lay.</verse4>
    <verse5>Then entered in those Wise men three. Full reverently upon their knee. And offered there in His presence. Their gold and myrrh and frankincense.</verse5>
    <verse6>Then let us all with one accord. Sing praises to our heavenly Lord. That hath made Heaven and earth of nought. And with his blood mankind has bought.</verse6>
    <chorus>Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel. Born is the King of Israel!</chorus>
