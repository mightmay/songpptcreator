<english>
    <verse1>Here I am. Down on my knees again. Surrendering all. Surrendering all.</verse1>
    <verse2>Find me here. Lord as You draw me near. Desperate for You. Desperate for You. I surrender.</verse2>
    <verse3>Drench my soul. As mercy and grace unfold. I hunger and thirst. I hunger and thirst.</verse3>
    <verse4>With arms stretched wide. I know You hear my cry. Speak to me now. Speak to me now.</verse4>
    <chorus>I surrender. I surrender. I wanna know You more. I wanna know You more. [x2]</chorus>
	<bridge>Like a rushing wind. Jesus breathe within. Lord have Your way. Lord have Your way in me. Like a mighty storm. Stir within my soul. Lord have Your way. Lord have Your way in me.</bridge>
