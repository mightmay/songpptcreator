<english>
    <verse1>I believe in a hope that's so secure. In Your love there is no fear, Salvation is sure. I believe on the cross You took my pain. All my sins are washed away. Forgiven and free.</verse1>
    <verse2>I believe I am righteous through the One. Your obedience has won. I rest in all You've done. I believe You are everything I need. More of You and less of me. I fall at Your feet.</verse2>
    <prechorus>And now I see. As You are, so are we</prechorus>
    <bridge>Mountains be cast down. Valleys be raised. Christ be exalted lifted on high. Mountains be cast down. Valleys be raised. Christ be exalted lifted on high.</bridge>
    <chorus>Let my life resound Your praise. As an anthem of Your grace. There is power in Your name. Hallelujah Jesus You reign.</chorus>
