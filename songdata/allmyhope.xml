    <verse1>I've been held by the Savior. I've felt fire from above. I've been down to the river. I ain't the same, a prodigal returned.</verse1>
    <verse2>I'm no stranger to the prison. I've worn shackles and chains. But I've been freed and forgiven. I'm not going back, I'll never be the same. That's why I sing.</verse2>
    <bridge>There's a kind of thing that just breaks a man. Break him down to his knees. God, I've been broken more than a time or two. Yes, Lord then He picked me up and showed me. What it means to be a man.</bridge>
    <chorus>All my hope is in Jesus. Thank God that yesterday's gone. And all my sins are forgiven. I've been washed by the blood.</chorus>
