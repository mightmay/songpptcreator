		<segment1>Rising up above this wickedness. And unphased by your endless myths. Hands all around reach to slow him down. He's all about this sound</segment1>
		<segment2>We aren't playing by your rules. We'll never play the fool. So, no, you can't take what's inside of me</segment2>
		<segment3>All about the sound from way out. He's got the scars just to prove he's &quot;down&quot;. No apologies to confuse his brain. This argument is sustained</segment3>
		<segment4>He's walking, non-stopping out of the shadows. Sounds of the new-he's got a look in his eye. (that says) There's something more than you're feeding him. He's not afraid to say..no. You're talking, non-stopping echoing voices. But nothing you said made a dent in my head. I'm hearing you fearing him 'cause he's not afraid. He's not about bowing down to what you say</segment4>
		<segment5>You hates us 'cause we'll never go away. And like some sort of fungus we're growing everyday. And our knuckles aren't gragging so I guess that leaves to say. Our message isn't stopping until you drag us all away</segment5>
		<segment6>Hear the silent ignorant voices spew: &quot;You're all a pack of disoriented youth&quot;. He lives to see the day those vices end. But until then I'll send this..</segment6>
		<segment7>Off to you    </segment7>
