		<segment1>Breathing seems harder now. Life will all but last. And all at once the pleasure is gone. It's so predictable</segment1>
		<segment2>But now I see. I will forever sing</segment2>
		<segment3>Sing Hallelujah. My hearts ready. Ready for you. I am captured in your majesty. Beautiful Saviour. I surrender. You are my King. I am captured in your majesty. Sing Hallelujah</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm lost inside your words. Enough to change my soul. And all at once my pride fades. It's so unpredictable</segment4>
		<segment5>You're my joy. Forever I'll be where you are</segment5>
		<segment6>Sing Hallelujah. My hearts ready. Ready for you. I am captured in your majesty. Beautiful Saviour. I surrender. You are my King. I am captured in your majesty. Sing Hallelujah. Sing Hallelujah. Sing Hallelujah. Oh yah</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm living in the wonder of all your ways. My heart will worship for all my days. Only you (Aw yah) Only you</segment7>
		<segment8>Cause you're my joy. Forever I'll be where you are</segment8>
		<segment9>Sing Hallelujah. My hearts ready. Ready for you. I am captured in your majesty. Beautiful Saviour. I surrender. You are my King. I am captured in your majesty. Only your majesty</segment9>
		<segment10>(I'll sing Hallelujah). I'm living in the wonder of all your ways. My heart will worship for all my days. For only you (only you). Only you (only you)     </segment10>
