		<segment1>I stand surrounded by the walls that once confined me. Knowing I'll be underneath them. When they crumble when they fall. With clarity my scars remind me. Ash still simmers just under my skin</segment1>
		<segment2>Indifference smile again. So much I hide. How is stepping back a move forward?</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I'm forced to look behind. I'm forced to look at you. You wear a thousand faces. Tell me, tell which is you. Broken mirrors paint the floor. Why can't you see the truth. You wear a thousand faces. Tell me, tell me which is you. Tell me which is you</segment3>
		<segment4>Eerilly time made no change. Pointing fingers, laying blame. Lying over and over and over and over. Deceiving your mind. Dug my grace, trash my name. Yet here I stand so you won't fade away</segment4>
		<segment5>A different smile again. So much I hide. How is stepping back a move forward</segment5>
		<segment6>Now I'm forced to look behind. I'm forced to look at you. You wear a thousand faces. Tell me, tell which is you. Broken mirrors paint the floor. Why can't you see the truth. You wear a thousand faces. Tell me, tell me which is you. Tell me which is you</segment6>
		<segment7>I bleed inside. (Wanna Bleed). Just let it out. (You gotta let it out). Just let it out. (Gotta let it out). I bleed inside. (Wanna Bleed Inside). Just let it out. (You gotta let it out). Just let it out. Let it die    </segment7>
