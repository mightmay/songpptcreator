		<segment1>I'm laying here, waiting for You. Are seasons coming round?. The weather's cold, next thing I know. The ice is on the ground</segment1>
		<segment2>Every year You meet me here. But You never stay</segment2>
		<segment3>You're like an angel in the snow. I knew You'd come but soon You'll go. You have to leave but believe. You'll be frozen in my mind and back to life. Come winter time, mmm, mmm</segment3>
		<segment4>Night time comes and soon it'll go. Hide behind the light. I'll open my eyes and peek outside. The ground is colored white</segment4>
		<segment5>I hate it when You leave. But I love when You arrive</segment5>
		<segment6>You're like an angel in the snow. I knew You'd come but soon You'll go. You have to leave but believe. You'll be frozen in my mind and back to life. Come winter time</segment6>
		<segment7>And I don't know why. You have to come and go</segment7>
		<segment8>But when the weather gets warm. And the sun starts to shine. I know it's time to say goodbye. Yeah, whoa, oh</segment8>
		<segment9>You're like an angel in the snow. I knew You'd come but soon You'll go. You have to leave but believe. You'll be frozen in my mind and back to life. And back to life and back to life. Come winter time    </segment9>
