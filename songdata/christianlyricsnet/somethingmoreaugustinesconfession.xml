		<segment1>Augustine just woke up with a broken heart. All this time, he's never been awake before. At thirty-one, his whole world is a question mark. All this time, he's never been awake before </segment1>
		<segment2>Watching dreams that he once had feed the flame inside his head. In a quiet desperation of the emptiness he says </segment2>
		<segment3>'There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for. I'm crying out to You. There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for. I'm crying out to You' </segment3>
		<segment4>Augustine, all his fears keep falling out. All this time, he's never been awake before. Finding out his old dreams aren't panning out. All this time, he's never been awake before </segment4>
		<segment5>But he's mad to be alive and he's dying to be met. In a quiet desperation of the emptiness he says </segment5>
		<segment6>There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for. I'm crying out to You. There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for. I'm crying out to You' </segment6>
		<segment7>Hey, I give it all away. Nothing I was holding back remains. Hey, I give it all away. Looking for the grace of God today </segment7>
		<segment8>There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for. I'm crying out to You. There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for. I'm crying out to You. There's gotta be something more than what I'm living for. I'm crying out to You    </segment8>
