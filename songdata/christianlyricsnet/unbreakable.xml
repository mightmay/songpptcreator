		<segment1>Where are the people that accuse me?. The ones who beat me down and bruise me. They hide, just out of sight. Can't face me in the light. They'll return, but I'll be stronger </segment1>
		<segment2>God I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me </segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes it's hard to just keep going. But faith is moving without knowing. Can I trust what I canÂ’t see. to reach my destiny?. I want to take control, but I know better </segment3>
		<segment4>God I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me </segment4>
		<segment5>Forget the fear, it's just a crutch. That tries to hold you back until your dreams are dust. All you need to do is just trust. (Trust, trust, trust) </segment5>
		<segment6>God I want to dream again. Take me where I've never been. I want to go there. This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable. It's unmistakable. No one can touch me. Nothing can stop me </segment6>
		<segment7>God I want to dream again (I want to dream again!). Take me where I've never been. I want to go there (I wanna go there). This time I'm not scared. Now I am unbreakable (I am unbreakable!). It's unmistakable. No one can touch me (No one can touch me!). Nothing can stop me    </segment7>
