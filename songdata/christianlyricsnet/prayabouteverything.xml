		<segment1>Time is tight and money's short. River's up and the weather man. He's calling for another storm. Pressure's on, margin's thin. Gotta figure out of thicks. For this all for fix I'm in</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh mama, what am I gonna do?. She said, &quot;Child, there's only one thing you can do&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't worry 'bout nothing. Let it go, see what tomorrow brings. Don't worry 'bout nothing. Pray 'bout everything</segment3>
		<segment4>Love is blind, fate don't care. Lose your grip and your balloons. Go sailing off into the air</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh mama, what am I gonna do?. She said, &quot;Child, there's only one thing you can do&quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>Don't worry 'bout nothing. Just let it go, see what tomorrow brings. Don't worry 'bout nothing. Pray 'bout everything. Hey, pray about everything</segment6>
