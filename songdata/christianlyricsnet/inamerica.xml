		<segment1>Is it better not to look back or. should we dust off our journals. Stare deep through the feedback for the new day. Like the distortion has things to say. Is it better to ignore it, that. these bomb shelters are built of sand. Scoring themes from our views, making movies of tragic news. Does this helpless picnic have its own Neverland</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. America never hurts. They say America never cries. Like no one's lost in America. No one's lost in America</segment2>
		<segment3>Listening to pink noise, we make. mirrors out of shop windows. No one dares to pull the red card, conscience is scared by truths we'd discard. And now we've Arilius, but soon comes Decious, and perhaps Constantine is a devil. Keen on making things easy</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Come alive, come alive</segment5>
		<segment6>The prophet's cello's silenced, if love burns us down to violence. If the whims of the nations cater. elation will we not need a soul to blame?. He has to take it all alone. Is His move political, a play for the people? No. He takes one for the little guy. He takes a hit for the little guy</segment6>
		<segment7>They say America never hurts. They say America never cries, Like no one's lonely in America. Like no one's lonely in America    </segment7>
