		<segment1>I saw the face of Jesus. In a little orphan girl. She was standing in the corner. On the other side of the world. And I heard the voice of Jesus. Gently whisper to my heart. Didnt you say you wanted to find Me. Well here I am. Here you are</segment1>
		<segment2>So what now. What will you do now that youve found Me. What now. What will you do with this treasure youve found. I know I may not look like what you expected. But if youll remember. This is right where I said I would be. You found Me. What now</segment2>
		<segment3>I saw the face of Jesus. Down on Sixteenth Avenue. He was sleeping in an old car. While his mom when looking for food. And I heard the voice of Jesus. Gently whisper to my soul. Didnt you say you wanted to know me. Where here I am. And its getting cold</segment3>
		<segment4>So what now. What will you do now that youve found Me. What now. What will you do with this treasure youve found. I know I may not look like what you expected. But if youll remember. This is right where I said I would be. You found Me. What now</segment4>
		<segment5>So come and know. Come and know, know me now. Come, come and know, know me now. Oh, come and know. Come, come and know, know me now. Come, come and know, know me now</segment5>
		<segment6>What will you do now that you found Me. What now. What will you do with this treasure youve found. I know I may not look like what you expected. But if youll remember. This is right where I said I would be. You found Me. What now. What now.     </segment6>
