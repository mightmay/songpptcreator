		<segment1>Walking out alone. The night fits like a stone inside a boot heel. Hot and cold winds blow. And no one is here to know the way I feel. The corner I once knew brings me in to view again. So I could stay out late, find new bones to break. But then I'd be dragging home admitting</segment1>
		<segment2>I am because You are I am. I recognize clearly I see. I am because You are I am. I am in You and You are in me. Spent too many days devising many. ways trying to escape you</segment2>
		<segment3>Played too many roles. Dug too many holes just big enough to fall in to. And I could linger here, hoping to disappear in excuses. Come morning is shining face I'd be crawling. to the place I call home Where first you. cut me loose and The places that Iive. carried You, I wouldn't take a dog. Stop and calmly think of that. Tear this church down to it's cornerstone. And build it up again, build me up again.    </segment3>
