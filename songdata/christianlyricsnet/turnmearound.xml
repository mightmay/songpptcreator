		<segment1>The sweetened whisper that I know. Comes to me when I have a restless heart. Fainter than a passing glance yet stops me where I stand. Waiting for just one more look from you</segment1>
		<segment2>Your love is not like mine </segment2>
		<segment3>Turn me around. Show me how to love profoundly. I want everything you are, everything you are. Turn me around. Even when I cannot see. I want everything you are, everything you are</segment3>
		<segment4>The deepest longing that I know. Comes to me when I am awaiting you. No greater love could you have shown and who could know the cost. How far you go to seek and save the lost</segment4>
		<segment5>Your love is not like mine </segment5>
		<segment6>Turn me around. Show me how to love profoundly. I want everything you are, everything you are. Turn me around. Even when I cannot see. I want everything you are, everything you are</segment6>
		<segment7>I only want to see your face.     </segment7>
