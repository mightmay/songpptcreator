		<segment1>One day youve got me laughing. One day youve got me crying. One day youve got me thinking. Im going out of my mind. But one thing is true. The one thing that never changes. Is that youve always got me</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: On a Monday, on a Tuesday, on a Wednesday. All the way around til Sunday. Youve always got me on the good days. And the bad days and the mad days. The happy and the sad days. Youve got me every day of my life</segment2>
		<segment3>One night youve got candles burning. One night your head is aching. Most nights youve got several hundred things. Still on your list to get done. But one thing stays true. One thing you can know for certain. Is that youve always got me</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Youve always got me. Youve always got me by your side. Youve always got me. Every single day of my life. Youve always got me. Youve always got me by your side. Youve always got me</segment5>
		<segment6>One thing stays true. Theres one thing you can know for certain. Is that youve always got me</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS </segment7>
		<segment8>. .     </segment8>
