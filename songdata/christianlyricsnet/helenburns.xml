		<segment1>Gone away, gone away forever. Not to come back home. I did stay all the night through with you. Without knowing youd gone</segment1>
		<segment2>Without time for the world to breathe on. The changing dust it woke. Glimpses of all the life you poured out. Till the vessel broke</segment2>
		<segment3>Dont know if Ill see you. When its my turn to come home. Dont know if Ill see you. But I hope so, but I hope so</segment3>
		<segment4>Parting now at our own Grey Havens. The words you left the debris. So be still, knowing that Hell see you across the Sea</segment4>
		<segment5>Dont know if Ill see you. When its my turn to come home. Dont know if Ill see you. But I hope so, but I hope so</segment5>
		<segment6>To be woken from the long sleep. Of this worlds night</segment6>
		<segment7>Dont know if Ill see you. When its my turn to come home. Dont know if Ill see you. But I hope so, but I hope so    </segment7>
