		<segment1>Like the summer breeze. She came as a surprise and danced with me. And as we spun around. I lost my feet fell love-sick on the ground</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Each time I've believed. Love has proved to be. A fool's parade. Lost in this masquerade. Marching in line trying hard to keep time with my broken heart beat. Fool's parade. Cries the band as it plays. And love makes it retreat. Every step of my feet. Sends it away. Hear the crowd point and say. It's a fool's parade</segment2>
		<segment3>Lying next to me. I would hold her close and listen to her breath. One dark morning she was gone. Found out I had played the fool all along</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>How I wish I could believe. When our princess waves at me. That my true love has been found. But someone's always just behind. To get the wave I thought was mine. I always played a clown</segment5>
		<segment6>A fool's parade. Lost in this masquerade. Marching in line trying hard to keep time with my broken heart beat. Fool's parade. Cries the band as it plays. And love makes it retreat. Every step of my feet. Sends it away. Hear the crowd point and say. It's a fool's parade    </segment6>
