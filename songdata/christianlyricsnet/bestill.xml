		<segment1>be still and know He. know He is holy. be still and know He is God. we have our lives with inventions. that have hurried us nowhere fast. now we need to turn our attentions. to what will last </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. be still and know He. know He is holy. be still and know He is God. love Him more dearly. see Him more clearly. be still and know He is God </segment2>
		<segment3>we've been running without a direction. we're afraid to get there late. what we need is strength just to kneel down. and wait </segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus -    </segment4>
