		<segment1>Epicurean theme to a never-ending sequence. Burns me out, dries me up. Up and out and through. My plans disappoint, drain my cup. Blind man sat in his room and he cried. &quot;Tomorrow promised me triviality&quot;. Bite the bait, swallow the hook. Hooked in routine instead of living. Wonder what's become of me </segment1>
		<segment2>What's become of me?. What's become of me anyway? </segment2>
		<segment3>I've been uncaring, unconcerned. Except at what comes dangerously close to. Overturning my house of cards. Falls fast and furious. Scattering shapes of well-worn self-conceit. Blind man shook his fist and he cried. &quot;Surely those were my rights&quot;. As if it were as bad as that. To be condemned to doing as thou wilt. Wilt and fade away. The kernel must first. So here I wait for You </segment3>
		<segment4>I wait for You. I wait for You all the while </segment4>
		<segment5>My way sucks and I don't know what to do. My way sucks and I don't know. My way sucks and so I'm giving it all to You. My way sucks and so I give.     </segment5>
