		<segment1>Just when I thought I was gone. Too far, too far gone. And no one cared. Just when I thought I was lost. So lost, I'd never be found. I turn around and you're right there. You're right there</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You open up your arms. And give me a new start. I need you. I need you more than my next breath. I know that I am loved. Because you bought me with your blood. I need you. I need you more than my next breath. Yeah, yeah</segment2>
		<segment3>Ashamed of who I'd become. Afraid that if I looked up. I'd see your tears. But you have called me by name. And you have loved me the same. I'm forever changed. And you are here, you are here</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: You open up your arms. And give me a new start. I need you. I need you more than my next breath. I know that I am loved. Because you bought me with your blood. I need you. I need you more than my next breath. Yeah, yeah</segment4>
		<segment5>I surrender my soul. To your love, to your whole. Where you go I will go with you</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: You open up your arms. And give me a new start. I need you. I need you more than my next breath. I know that I am loved. Because you bought me with your blood. I need you more than my next breath. Yeah, yeah, oh    </segment6>
