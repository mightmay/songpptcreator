		<segment1>All the things I want to say. All at once they wash away. As You walk by, out of mind. My thoughts fly away </segment1>
		<segment2>All the things I long to hear. Suddenly they reappear. You say in that hour Your holy Power. Will wipe away my fears </segment2>
		<segment3>I can hear You cry out loud. When You Answer Me. When You answer me. Once again I am revived. When You answer me You answer. When You answer me You answer me with love </segment3>
		<segment4>To know You are I Am. Confidence of lion lying with the lamb. In greener fields, with all my zeal, Is hard to comprehend </segment4>
		<segment5>I can hear You cry out loud. When You Answer Me. When You answer me. Once again I am revived. When You answer me You answer. When You answer me You answer me with.. </segment5>
		<segment6>(With) love so understanding. I can hardly catch my breath. Seeing this I wonder how You have any love left. (Left) me not alone. When I did not believe. Through the darkness, through the darkness You answer me </segment6>
		<segment7>I can hear You cry out loud. When You Answer Me. When You answer me. Once again I am revived. When You answer me You answer. When You answer me You answer me with love </segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
