		<segment1>[Verse 1]. You might be the wife, waiting up at night. You might be the man, struggling to provide. feeling like it's hopeless. Maybe you're the son who chose a broken road. Maybe you're the girl thinking you'll end up alone. Praying God can you hear me?. Oh, God are you listening?</segment1>
		<segment2>. [Chorus]. Am I more than flesh and bone?. Am I really something beautiful?. Yeah, I want to believe, I want to believe that. I'm not just some wandering soul. That you don't see and you don't know. Yeah, I want to believe, Jesus help me believe. That I am someone worth dying for</segment2>
		<segment3>. [Verse 2]. I know you've heard the truth that God has set you free. But you think you're the one that grace could never reach. So you just keep asking, Oh, what everybody's asking</segment3>
		<segment4>[Repeat Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>. [Bridge]. You're worth it, you can't earn it. Yeah, the cross has proven, That you're sacred and blameless. Your life has purpose!</segment5>
		<segment6>. You are more than flesh and bone. Can't you see your something beautiful. Yeah, you gotta believe, you gotta believe. He wants you to see, He wants you to see that. You're not just some wandering soul. That can't be seen and can't be known. You gotta believe, you gotta believe. That you are someone worth dying for</segment6>
