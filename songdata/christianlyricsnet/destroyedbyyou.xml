		<segment1>Can someone tell me why I'm feeling this way?. Can someone tell me why this world is so grey?. It's never just black and white. So much went on tonight. Was I wrong or was I right?. You think the whole world revolves around around your head. You are ignoring me, you haven't heard a word I've just said. Why can't I just pull myself together?. What's done is done, never say never. Always look for good in the bad. Learn from the mistakes that I have had. I re and re-learn. To let it go. Talk is easy. But it's so hard to show    </segment1>
