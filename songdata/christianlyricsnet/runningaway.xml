		<segment1>Followed my feet to nowhere again, wherever I go there I am. I'm stuck on this road and life just keeps passing me by. What can I do to get from beyond these walls that are laughing at me?. Sentenced to life and the prison is in my mind.</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). Losing my mind and pushed to the acts, Someone stop me from running away. Losing my mind and pushed to the acts, Someone stop me from running away.</segment2>
		<segment3>Followed my feet to nowhere again, think that I'm going insane. Searching for peace by the outcome is always the same. I wanna beleive that I'm here for something. More than just taking up space. Running away cause I just can't deal with this pain..</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>(radio voice in background). Here I am..</segment5>
		<segment6>(Repeat chorus 2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>(Losing my mind) Someone stop me from running away.. (Losing my mind) Someone stop me from running away..    </segment7>
