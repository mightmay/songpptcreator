		<segment1>I met a man who walked on water. And wore His crown like a blue collar. I met a man who welcomed children. Like they were ambassadors to a kingdom</segment1>
		<segment2>If I saw the world in Your eyes. Would it help me understand. How You see through all our lies. Still You hold us in Your hand. I'm dying to believe. I'm trying just to show. That we're less than perfect. More than flesh and bone</segment2>
		<segment3>People climbing trees to catch sight of You. Broken and blind looking for the truth. We're crippled by our fears and torments. Oh, Son of man, have pity on Your servants</segment3>
		<segment4>I wander and I want. Squander the riches of Your love. It's never enough for me. Oh, take this poverty. And nail it to the tree. And let all that's captive now go free. I'm free    </segment4>
