		<segment1>from whence comes fights. and wars among men. it's from lust, that hides within. greed, kill and desire. fight and not obtain. asking god possessions. never granted, ask amiss. for their own flesh. war begings in men's heart. and finish there too. when passions are submitted. and love fills the heart    </segment1>
