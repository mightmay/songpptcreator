		<segment1>It was your blood and the blood of your brothers outnumbered and your backs against the wall but you fought with reason and you fought for purpose for life for liberty for the freedom of your children sons of liberty we've made a mockery twisting justice built on lies cast off a master for another no way trial and error eight year pay day the solution the formula that we wanted in theory we had it all i can't say that their motives were pure but they did fight for what they believed over the years we tore it down from the roots we ripped it out just to suit the very few out with the old and in with the new.    </segment1>
