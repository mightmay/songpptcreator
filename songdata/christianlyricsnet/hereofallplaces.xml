		<segment1>Here of all places. I'm face to face with. What You began and what I've become. First there was fire. Now, just a flicker. Will breaking my heart lead me back to You?</segment1>
		<segment2>I shout truth at You. Without love for You. I am blown up beyond recognition. I will sing to You. 'Cos You made me to. Won't You help me to mean it?</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Better here than nowhere</segment3>
		<segment4>Something out of nothing. Beauty from ashes. A glorious reign after humiliation. So, I race through. Here of all places. Where nothing is left but my trust in You</segment4>
		<segment5>You won't give me up. You can't let me down. You'll be standing to welcome me home (one day). Come sing over me. Come sing over me. Won't You help me to hear it?</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
