		<segment1>I see my future in your eyes. but I never thought I'd know. what it was to feel this way. but you've taken that away. there was no one else like you. when I first saw your smile. I never thought it'd be you. to change my life this way </segment1>
		<segment2>but now I'm yours. and I feel so much more. I want to be there. the rest of your life. but I just can't see. how I deserve you </segment2>
		<segment3>I could not have picked a better. person to be you </segment3>
		<segment4>funny when I had the chance to speak to you. I fell right to the floor in a wave of insecurities. I never know why you came to me. someone people talked about but few would talk to </segment4>
		<segment5>and now I'm yours. and I feel so much more. I want to be there. the rest of your life. but I just can't see. how I deserve you </segment5>
		<segment6>I don't know what to do sometimes. I just want to be all I can for you now. I'll be there when you need to be held. I'll be there when you're tired </segment6>
		<segment7>I could not want more than what I have in you. what I have in you. (x2).     </segment7>
