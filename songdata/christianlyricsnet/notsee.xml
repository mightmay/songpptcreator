		<segment1>You tell of a time with a grimace, you speak of an era of hate. Applaud those who had tried those killers, yet refuse to conceive you're the same. Applaud those who had tried those killers, yet refuse to conceive you're the same. </segment1>
		<segment2>Over the blanket of fifty long years, the subtleties are but washed away. You've revised history to keep conscience at bay;. in your bunker of pragmatism-your cowardice clear. </segment2>
		<segment3>Euthanasia, abortion convenience killing started with ''Noble'' or convenient intention. Build a society without a God you can commit any evil. </segment3>
