		<segment1>Everything must change. There's a mirror showing me the ugly truth. These bones they ache with holy fire. But I've got nothing to give, just a life to live. If your world is without colour. I will carry you, if you carry me</segment1>
		<segment2>Every little thing's gonna be alright. Every little thing's gonna be alright [x2]</segment2>
		<segment3>There's no-one else to blame. I live my life between the fire and the flame. I've built my house where the ocean meets the land. It's time to live again, pull my dreams out of the sand. Let your world be full of colour. I will carry you, if you carry me</segment3>
		<segment4>When it's all falling down on you. You're crying out but you're breaking in two. When it's all crashing down on you. When there's nothing you can do. There is someone who can carry you    </segment4>
