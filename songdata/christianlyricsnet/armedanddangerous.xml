		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on 2 Corinthians 10:4, Ephesians 6:11-17</segment1>
		<segment2>It used to be a distant call. Thought to be for some but never all. Now our wounded lay on every side. Now this call to arms can't be denied </segment2>
		<segment3>The enemy will tremble. As young and old assemble. A mighty army up in arms </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). Armed and dangerous. God's enemies will scatter. Armed and dangerous. We'll see the darkness shatter. This armor is worth it's weight. No weapon can penetrate. Armed and dangerous. We're ready to storm the gate </segment4>
		<segment5>We're not so tough on our own. Not one can even stand all alone. Just a rag tag army at its best. We sometimes even fail the smallest test. But though this tribulation. There comes a transformation. We don the armor of our King </segment5>
		<segment6>Stand!. Up against the flood. Stand!. Covered by His blood. We are the standard He has raised. Stand!. Earnestly contend. Stand!. To the very end. We've only just begun to fight     </segment6>
