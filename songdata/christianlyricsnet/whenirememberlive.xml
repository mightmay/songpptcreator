		<segment1>That boy is gone. Sometimes i miss the way he wept at night. To be still and not run. To be rocked to sleep in your light. These days there is not much that will bring tears to my eyes. But when i remember who i am and who you are. When i remember. A cloud moves in, rain falls, thunder strikes, and sunshine breaks through the clouds</segment1>
		<segment2>I am walking blind. So distracted that i don't even feel when you hold me. When did i grow such thick skin. You are my sunshine and rain. My joy and sweet pain. I'm a spotless stain. That boy is gone. But nobody moves me like you do. When i remember</segment2>
		<segment3>A cloud moves in, rain falls, thunder strikes. And sunshine breaks through the clouds. I can cry out of sorrow and joy. Every drop of rain turns into a crystal in the sun. So wash my eyes, my clothes, my skin, my bones, my soul. My feet, my love. I'm not forgotten. I'm in your thoughts cause i feel sunshine in the rain</segment3>
		<segment4>To this day nobody moves. Nobody. Nobody moves me like you do.     </segment4>
