		<segment3>On and on I see you. The life that comes together. To see that we're forever. On and on I see you. The times we've spent together. The times that last forever</segment3>
		<segment4>And now we will find our way. It's the way that we'll find this day. And I know you belong to me</segment4>
		<segment5>Could you lead me on    </segment5>
