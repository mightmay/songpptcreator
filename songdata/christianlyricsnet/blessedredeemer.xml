		<segment1>Up Calvary's mountain one dreadful morn. Walked Christ my Savior, weary and worn. Facing for sinners, death on the cross. That He might save them from endless loss</segment1>
		<segment2>Blessed Redeemer, precious Redeemer. Seems now I see Him on Calvary's tree. Wounded and bleeding, for sinners pleading. Blind and unheeding, dying for me</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;Father, forgive them,&quot; my Savior prayed. Even while His lifeblood flowed fast away. Praying for sinners while in such woe. No one but Jesus ever loved so</segment3>
