		<segment1>Some time since we've spoken I admit that I do not see. Your signs and wonders anymore. Look now, I am broken. Ran around enough to find me. Crawling again across Your floor because I need You. Each and every day Yeah, I need You. In each and every way It's me short of breath. My last one I'd gladly give. You If You will search until I'm found</segment1>
		<segment2>The angels and nature will Cry in disbelief to see that. The King is crawling on the ground because. There's nothing like need to make me want You. There's nothing like need to bring me near. There's nothing like need to make me love You</segment2>
		<segment3>My desperate need My desperate need You hear. Face down, facing You It's a bitter sweet position. Craving mercy from Your hand. Stand up and walk again. Richer from Your wealth of kindness. And all the more I understand that.    </segment3>
