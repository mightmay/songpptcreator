		<segment1>Our God is the God of gods. Our Lord is the Lord of kings. The revealer of secrets, of mysteries unknown. Let the people praise our God</segment1>
		<segment2>His sovereign rule will last forever. His kingdom won't decline or fall. He does as He pleases both in Heaven and Earth. Who am I that I should question Him at all?</segment2>
		<segment3>He lifts up kings and brings them low again. He shows us what is right from wrong. God of all time we give You thanks and praise. For you have made us wise and You have made us strong</segment3>
		<segment4>Everything He does is right and all His ways are just. Those who walk in pride He is able to humble    </segment4>
