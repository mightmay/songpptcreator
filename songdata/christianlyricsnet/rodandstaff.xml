		<segment1>Love the skies are shining so bright today. That a miracle could happen. Just don't let those dark clouds get into the way. And don't let your faith get dampened. Let one of His teardrops touch your pain. And ease it away like a summer rain. Let His love flow through your harvest of grain. And let His fire burn up your chaff. Get ahold of His rod and staff. Hell lead you through the desert. Hell take you through the paths. Get ahold of His rod and staff. And let the praises flow like a river. Flow like a river to God. Let us give to the Giver. Give to the Giver of life. You've always wanted to know Him. And now He's asking you. Won't you come on in</segment1>
		<segment2>(Repeat) </segment2>
		<segment3>Love the skies are shining so bright today. That a miracle. A miracle. A miracle could happen    </segment3>
