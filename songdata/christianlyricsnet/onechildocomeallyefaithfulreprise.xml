		<segment1>The seed, it grows and somehow becomes a life. It moves, she knows that her baby has arrived, She's so scared, but she's so blessed. She lays down her fear for the hope at her breast for she knows..</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: One million chains could never hold back this moment in time. One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means. Heaven and earth, they cradle the infinite Joy born on this night. For it only takes one Child to forever change the world</segment2>
		<segment3>He stands beside her, he'd share her pain if he only knew how. He whispers 'I love you' as he gently strokes her brow. He's so scared, but he's so blessed. There's a thundering pride pounding deep in his chest. For he knows..</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Christ is born, we are blessed. Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess. That we know.</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>This Baby cries and for the first time. The world hears the voice of God weep. Mary sings a lullaby. As the Hope of the nations gently falls asleep. She knows this is the one Child. To forever change the world.     </segment7>
