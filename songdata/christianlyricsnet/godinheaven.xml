		<segment1>In this world I don't belong. But I'm living it. I've found the words to heaven's song. Now I'm singing it. Songs of freedom, words of love. Reveal the saving grace of God. The sound of heaven on this earth. We'll sing</segment1>
		<segment2>To God in heaven, be the glory. To God in heaven, be the glory. Great things my Saviour, he has done. And greater things are yet to come</segment2>
		<segment3>We've got this treasure in our hands. And we're bringing it. A hidden church bell in this land. Now we're ringing it. Our heroes lived and died to see. These words of glory set us free. To live for heaven on this earth. We'll sing    </segment3>
