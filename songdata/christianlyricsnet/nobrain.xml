		<segment1>Give her milk, milk and cookies. Give her everything, even cooties. That girl's insane, suprised she even knows my name. Since the day we met that girl's got no brain. There was something strange, Something strange about her. She never spoke a word. Or moved a muscle. That girl's insane, Surprised she even knows my name. Since the day we met that girl's got no brain. I browse to make up words. To write up a note. I haven't decided what they'll be. I got this problem and I don't know why. She got no brains and she's left me for another guy.     </segment1>
