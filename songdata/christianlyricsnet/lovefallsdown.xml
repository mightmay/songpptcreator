		<segment1>Yes I'm living for today, When our dreams won't go away. And the promise that you gave. To see the earth resound with praise</segment1>
		<segment2>And I believe it's time to change. And yes, I need your hand to break these chains</segment2>
		<segment3>And love falls down on me. Love falls down on me</segment3>
		<segment4>Yes, we're going all the way, Tomorrow's dreams are here today. I feel the joy beneath my feet. Will it be long before we meet?</segment4>
		<segment5>And I believe my heart has found. All the good that comes from God above</segment5>
		<segment6>And love falls down on me. Love falls down on me. And when heaven opens love will come. And will roll like a river, Yeah love falls down    </segment6>
