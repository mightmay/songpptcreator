		<segment1>sometimes it's embarrassing to talk to you. to hold a conversation with the only one who sees right through. this version of myself. i try to hide behind. i'll bury my face because my disgrace will leave me terrified</segment1>
		<segment2>and sometimes i'm so thankful for your loyalty. your love regardless of the mistakes i make will spoil me. my confidence is, in a sense, a gift you've given me. and i'm satisfied to realize you're all i'll ever need</segment2>
		<segment3>you looked into my life. and never stopped. and you're thinking all my thoughts. are so simple but so beautiful. and you recite my words right back to me. before i even speak. you let me know, i am understood</segment3>
		<segment4>and sometimes i spend my time. just trying to escape. i work so hard, so desperately, in an attempt to create space. cause i want distance from the utmost important thing i know. i see your love, then turn my back, and beg for you to go</segment4>
		<segment5>you looked into my life. and never stopped. and you're thinking all my thoughts. are so simple but so beautiful. and you recite my words right back to me. before i even speak. you let me know, i am understood</segment5>
		<segment6>you're the only one who understands. completely. you're the only one who knows me yet still loves completely</segment6>
		<segment7>and sometimes the place i'm at is at a loss for words. if i think of something worthy, i know that it's already yours. and through the times i've faded and you've outlined me again. you've just patiently waited, to bring me back and then</segment7>
		<segment8>you looked into my life. and never stopped. and you're thinking all my thoughts. are so simple but so beautiful. and you recite my words right back to me. before i even speak. you let me know, i am understood</segment8>
		<segment9>the noise has broken my defense. let me embrace salvaction. your voice has broken my defense. let me embrace salvation</segment9>
		<segment10>the noise has broken my defense. let me embrace salvaction. your voice has broken my defense. let me embrace salvation</segment10>
		<segment11>the noise has broken my defense. let me embrace salvaction. your voice has broken my defense. let me embrace salvation</segment11>
		<segment12>your voice has broken my defense. let me embrace salvation. let me embrace. let me embrace salvation    </segment12>
