		<segment1>My Saviour, Redeemer. My love and my Lord. I'll give You all of my heart. My will and my soul. You take me as I am. A scarred and broken man. Lord, I surrender all I have to You. To You</segment1>
		<segment2>Refrain: I will give you everything. I will, I will. Make my life an offering. I will, I will</segment2>
		<segment3>My Saviour, I'll never. Forget what You've done. You carried the weight of my sin. To the cross, the victory's won!. You make my heart brand new. Now there's nothing I won't do. Lord, I surrender all I am to You, to You</segment3>
		<segment4>So when I lose my life, I save it, I save it. And by Your Grace I'm saved. I know, I know it. And when You were on the cross. You gave it, You gave it all. Oh, yes You did. You gave it all</segment4>
		<segment5>(Refrain)</segment5>
		<segment6>I will give my heart to You. I will, I will. Broken and poured out for You. I will, I will</segment6>
		<segment7>No price I pay. Will ever be too great for me</segment7>
		<segment8>To rest alone in the love You've shown. I'm free, I'm free</segment8>
		<segment9>You took the stripes. You took the pain for me</segment9>
		<segment10>So now I sing a song of hope. I'm free, I'm free</segment10>
		<segment11>So now I sing Hallelujah. I'm free, I'm free.     </segment11>
