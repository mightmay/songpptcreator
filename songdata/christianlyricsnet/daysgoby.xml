		<segment1>So don't sit back and watch the days go by. Are you ever gonna live before you die. And when things fall apart. The world has come undone. Leave it all behind. Leave the loneliness alone. You wait forever blind</segment1>
		<segment2>So come on and leave the years. When you watched the days go by. Come on and leave the fears. That you were afraid to find. Cause while you wait inside. The days go by</segment2>
		<segment3>So all the memories fade. And the days go by. Forget the lonely yesterdays in mind. I know it's never gonna be the way you like. I know you don't wanna think about the endlessness you find. You wait forever blind</segment3>
		<segment4>So come on and leave the years. When you watched the days go by. Come on and leave the fears. That you were afraid to find. You're waiting for your time. Waiting for your time. All these days gone wrong. Who broke your fall. What a way to learn</segment4>
		<segment5>So come on and leave the years. When you watched the days go by. Come on and leave the fears. That you were afraid to find. Time is passing by. Time is passing by</segment5>
		<segment6>So come on and leave the years. When you watched the days go by. Come on and leave the fears. That you were afraid to find. Cause while you wait inside. The days go by    </segment6>
