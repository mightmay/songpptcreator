		<segment1>&lt;em&gt;Originally by Tears For Fears&lt;/em&gt;</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanted to be with you alone. And talk about the weather. But traditions I can trace against the child in your face. Won't escape my attention. You keep your distance via the system of touch. And gentle persuasion. I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much. Oh you're wasting my time. You're just wasting time.</segment2>
		<segment3>Something happens and I'm head over heels. I never find out until I'm head over heels. Something happens and I'm head over heels. Ah don't take my heart. Don't break my heart. Don't throw it away.</segment3>
		<segment4>I made a fire and watching it burn. Thought of your future. With one foot in the past now just how long will it last. No no no have you no ambition. My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air. And dreaming I'm a doctor. It's hard to be man when there's a gun in your hand. Oh I feel so..</segment4>
		<segment5>Something happens and I'm head over heels. I never find out until I'm head over heels. Something happens and I'm head over heels. Ah don't take my heart. Don't break my heart. Don't throw it away.</segment5>
		<segment6>And it's my four leaf clover. I'm on the line, one open mind. This is my four leaf clover.    </segment6>
