		<segment1>[chorus]. Make me, take me, break me, I am pierced. Make me, take me, break me, I am pierced</segment1>
		<segment2>Though I am wounded and unworthy. Though I am selfish and untrue. You are holy, You're the healer. You forgave me and made me new. Made me new</segment2>
		<segment3>[chorus]</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, this love, how can it be. That my God would die for me. For my sins, His wounds did bleed. Jesus, you were pierced for me</segment4>
