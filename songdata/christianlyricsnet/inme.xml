		<segment1>You said the words. And made the heavens. You breathed the stars. And put their place in the sky. You waved Your hand. Painted a sunset. You smiled and gave a heartbeat life </segment1>
		<segment2>Crazy to think. That Your holy hands. Made everything I see hear feel see. It's hard to believe. That You the God of creation say. Oh God say. I've got this power in me </segment2>
		<segment3>In me. There is strength to move a mountain. In me. There is faith to walk on water. In me. If I just believe. The Way and the Truth and the Life is. In me </segment3>
		<segment4>So please remind me. When I feel useless. That my flesh and bone. Has more than meets the eye. Because you burn. Like a fire within me. And there's nothing out of reach when I. Let you Spirit loose and be alive </segment4>
		<segment5>In me. There is strength to move a mountain. In me. There is faith to walk on water. In me. If I just believe. The Way and the Truth and the Life is. In me </segment5>
		<segment6>You set the world in motion. Put the waves in the ocean. And when it all comes down. I've got to believe. That You the God of creation say. I've got this power.     </segment6>
