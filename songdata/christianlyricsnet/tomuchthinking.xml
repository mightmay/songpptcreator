		<segment1>I can't get to sleep at. Night just thinking about. The day that you'll be. Here everything's gonna. Be alright when i'm. Thinking about holding. You near will you look. Away from me? please. Don't look away from me. I'm gonna sit and. Consider flowers i'm. Gonna sit and think for. Hours. Right now the box I'm in. Well it's a good box I. Hope you'll open it the. Way I see it in my mind is. You are here and there. You're gonna sit will you. Look away from me?. Please don't look away. From me. What it comes down to is. This with my. Expectations did I miss. The way you felt for me. Or did you ever want for. This to be?    </segment1>
