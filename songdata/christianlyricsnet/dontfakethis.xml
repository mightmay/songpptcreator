		<segment1>Ignoring, A loss of sight, Afraid, To bleed, Come night, Lose the sun.</segment1>
		<segment2>But don't, Make this out, To be more, Than it is, I'm behind, Every lie, There's a bird song within, YES YOU'RE MY SIGHT!!!</segment2>
		<segment3>The suffering, That's kept within, Dispose of the men, Lost, Inside, He was negative.</segment3>
		<segment4>This place, Once more was underground.</segment4>
		<segment5>So look, And connect, We're refusing to rust, Healing has to begin, In the past.</segment5>
		<segment6>So don't fake this, Don't fake this, Don't fake this, Don't!</segment6>
		<segment7>The suffering, That's kept within, Dispose of the men, Lost, Don't fake this, Don't fake this, Don't fake this, Don't!!!. FAKE!!!. FAKE!!!</segment7>
		<segment8>The suffering, That's kept within, Dispose of the men, Lost, So don't fake this, Don't fake this, Don't fake this, Don't!!!. FAKE!!!. FAKE!!!    </segment8>
