		<segment1>Here at Your feet, I lay my past down. My wanderings, all my mistakes down. And I am free</segment1>
		<segment2>Here at Your feet, I lay this day down. Not in my strength, but in Yours Ive found. All I need, Youre all I need</segment2>
		<segment3>Jesus, Jesus, at Your feet. Oh, to dwell and never leave. Jesus, Jesus, at Your feet. There is nowhere else for me. There is nowhere else for me</segment3>
		<segment4>Here at Your feet, I lay my future down. All of my dreams, I give to You now. And I find peace, I find peace. Here at Your feet, I lay my life down. For You my King, Youre all I want now. And my soul sings</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause I am free (here at Your feet). All I need (is at Your feet). I find peace. Were at Your feet. Were at Your feet</segment5>
		<segment6>And I am free (here at Your feet). All I need (is at Your feet). I find peace. Were at Your feet. Were at Your feet. Were at Your feet. Were at Your feet</segment6>
		<segment7>Here at Your feet. I lay my life down</segment7>
