		<segment1>My exit, unobserved, my homesickness, absurd, I said &quot;Water,&quot; Expecting the word would satisfy my thirst!. Talking all about the second and third when I haven't understood the first, Jonah, where's that boat going - Your ship set with eager sail?. There's a swirling storm soon blowing, and no use, fishermen, in rowing from a consecrated whale!. Just like the clouds bring a darkness and a hard rain's gonna fall. I felt the crowds bring a loneliness and a hard rain's gonna fall. she always weighed me down, but, afraid I might need her, I dragged her around. (it's best to keep close sackcloth and ash in a whitewashed town). she wore that phony smile on her face, I guess like a bandage on a wounded place. while I kept the keys to every old lock just in case, rehearsed indifference tossed aside, our narrow arms spread wide, &quot;What unseen pen etched eternal things on the hearts of humankind. But never let them in our minds?&quot;. Like the clouds bring a darkness and a hard rain's gonna fall. and all my laughter ends in emptiness and a hard rain's gonna fall. my every medicine caused more illness and a hard rain's gonna fall. but until I let you go I didn't know, you were never mine at all. but now I spend my days in ever-increasingly complicated ways. convincing myself of the rightness of each word. I say my exit, unfair if unobserved!. Ya subur, subhannallahi, a'udhu billahi minash-shaitanir-rajim, al-hamdu lillah, bismillahir rahmanir rahim    </segment1>
