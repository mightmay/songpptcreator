		<segment1>Am I alone in here?. Am I alone in here?. Am I alone in here?. Am I alone in here?</segment1>
		<segment2>Knew you were here, Sister confirmed suspicions, And beside the note, That you left on my bed, Where I held you close, Did you think I'd forget?. Couldn't be more of a mess, For to be, There used to be another way, I'd take you home.</segment2>
		<segment3>Well its time to wake up, And separate feelings, That I keep falling into, Each seem like good reasons, That I feel I'm a break down, I don't care if it shows up, I'm praying this for you, Until it turns it all safe.</segment3>
		<segment4>Now it seems there's a choice, Let me get with a break, Listen today, Know that never again, Will I know you that way.</segment4>
		<segment5>Well its time to wake up, And separate feelings, That I keep falling into, Each seem like good reasons, That I feel I'monna break down, I don't care if it shows up, I'm praying this for you, Until it turns it all safe.</segment5>
		<segment6>Am I alone in here? (12x)    </segment6>
