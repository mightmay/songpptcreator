		<segment1>Verse #1. I really hate to bother you but Lord, I've gotta whole lot on my mind. I know that you'll real busy but I promise. I won't take much of your time. but Lord I need a little grace. To help me make it through. I need to feel that kinda love that only comes from you</segment1>
		<segment2>COURSE. if you'll just squeeze my hand. let me feel you by my side. you said you'd never never leave me. you'd always be my guide. but the storms of life some times. won't let the sunshine through. Lord I need to feel that kinda love. that only comes from you. yes I need to feel that kinda love. that only comes from you. Verse #2. As a child I heard the preacher say that you. where a sinners friend. I remember when I came to you with a heart. a heart so black with sin. the night you turned my life around. it seemed you made me over new. the mercy that you showed me Lord. kept me coming back to you. COURSE.  if  you'll just squeeze my hand. let me feel you by my side(feel ya by my side). you said you'd never never leave. you'd always be my guide. but the storms of life some times won't let the sun shine through. Lord I need to feel that kinda love. that only comes from you. yes I need to feel that kinda love. that only comes from you. love comes from you.    </segment2>
