		<segment1>You hide secrets in your sleeves. You hope that no one else will ever see. The truth is everyone has scars. It doesnt matter who you are. Heartbreaks got you on the move. Tell me, wheres it taking you</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Run, run, run to love. Run to love. Cause love, love waits for us. Waits for us with open arms. Run to love</segment2>
		<segment3>Always trying to impress your friends. Intoxicated by adrenaline. Youre racing down a dead end road. We all know how that story goes. You live like theres nothing left to lose. What if that isnt true</segment3>
		<segment4>Come closer now. And hear the sound. Loves calling out    </segment4>
