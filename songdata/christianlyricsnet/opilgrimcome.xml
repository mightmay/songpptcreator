		<segment1>&quot;The cross stands as a mystery because it is foreign to everything we exalt self over principle, power over meekness, the quick fix over the long haul, cover up over confession, escapism over confrontation, comfort over sacrifice, feeling over commitment, legality over justice .. man over God.&quot; -- Ravi Zacharias</segment1>
		<segment2>O pilgrim come, here is the cross. Your pardon and your peace. Collapse upon the grace of God. Whose mercy is complete. O pilgrim come, here is the cross</segment2>
		<segment3>O pilgrim come, here is the cross. Cast all your pride away. And earthly treasures count as loss. In light of all you gain. O pilgrim come, here is the cross</segment3>
		<segment4>Here is mercy. Come be crucified with Christ. Here is mercy. Come be raised with Him to life</segment4>
		<segment5>O pilgrim come, here is the cross. God's judgment on your sin. Drink deep the shame that leads to life. And broken enter in. O pilgrim come, here is the cross. O pilgrim come, here is the cross</segment5>
		<segment6>O pilgrim come, here is the cross. And here your boast should be. What I could never do myself. My God has done for me. O pilgrim come, here is the cross</segment6>
		<segment7>O pilgrim come, here is the cross. No other path attend. O here begin your journeying. And here your journey end. O pilgrim come, here is the cross. O pilgrim come, here is the cross    </segment7>
