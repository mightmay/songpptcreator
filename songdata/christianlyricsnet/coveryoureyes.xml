		<segment1>Dear Emily, I don't think I believe in you anymore. It's a mystery, but what I'm seein' I haven't seen before.</segment1>
		<segment2>And with these tears you loose the last of my restraints. Cover your eyes!. She said run but I'm not running, no I'm not running. Let 'em come, let 'em come, but I'm not running. No, I ain't running no more.</segment2>
		<segment3>So you're asking me to see the truth as before. But if it hasn't occurred to you yet, this could be the past. The past no more.</segment3>
		<segment4>And if these tears should prove the last of my escape, cover your eyes!. She said run, but I'm not running no I'm not running. Let 'em come, let 'em come but I'm not running, no, I ain't running no more. No more!</segment4>
		<segment5>The trees have all begun the dance elated by a second chance. But when a windmill blows it's not hooked up to anything except a breeze.</segment5>
		<segment6>She said run, but I'm not running NO!. She said run, she said run, (run away, run away, run!) she said run, (run away, run away, run!). she said run, but I'm not running, no I ain't running no more.    </segment6>
