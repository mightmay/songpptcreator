		<segment1>LET ME DRINK FROM THE LIVING WATER, BRINGING LIFE TO MY VERY CORE. IN THE MIDST OF MY DESPERATION, JESUS. WHEN IM DRY, RUNNING ON EMPTY, FLOW YOUR STREAMS OF LIFE THROUGH ME. YOURE THE LIFE GIVING WATER, JESUS. COME, COME, COME TO THE RIVER. YOU ARE THE LIVING WATER. WASH ME CLEAN, WASH ME CLEAN. COME, COME, COME TO THE RIVER. YOU ARE THE LIVING WATER. FLOW THROUGH ME, WASH ME CLEAN. IN THIS PLACE WE HAVE FOUND OUR FREEDOM. CLEANSING STREAMS HAVE SET US FREE. YOU ARE ALL THAT WE EVER NEED, JESUS. I GIVE YOU ALL OF THE PRAISE. NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER TAKE YOUR PLACE, YOUR PLACE. I GIVE YOU ALL OF MY DAYS. NO ONE ELSE WILL EVER TAKE YOUR PLACE, YOUR PLACE.    </segment1>
