		<segment1>People get ready. For something like you've never seen</segment1>
		<segment2>Open up your eyes. Open up your heart. Open up your arms and let the Spirit of the Savior set you free</segment2>
		<segment3>You ain't seen nothing yet. All the rumors are true. I don't know about you. But I know there's more to this</segment3>
		<segment4>People, here it is. Just what we've all been waiting for</segment4>
		<segment5>There's more to life. Than being born and dying. There's more to life Than slowly growing old. If we are wise We'll keep our eyes on Jesus. Or miss out on the very thing that God has made us for    </segment5>
