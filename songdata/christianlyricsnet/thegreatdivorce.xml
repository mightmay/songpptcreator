		<segment1>Close your eyes, step off the bus its time. Don't hesitate don't fear, Our paths all lead to here. You won't need a thing, just who you are. You've got a long long way its far. The road before, was just the start. The road ahead, lies in your heart.</segment1>
		<segment2>The light will call you, To wrap its arms around you. The light will find you, and wrap its arms around you.</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I've arrived, step off this ride to find. What does it? what feels, The things that you've conceiled. Over the hills, just look ahead. The past is all but dead, your choice?. Is this for real, the time is now. It's at your heals.</segment3>
		<segment4>The light will call you, To wrap its arms around you. The light will find you, and wrap its arms around you.</segment4>
		<segment5>Make sure the question is clear. you hear, hear the voice. with the song of celebration.</segment5>
		<segment6>The light will call you, To wrap its arms around you. The light will find you, and wrap its arms around you.</segment6>
		<segment7>Close your eyes, close your eyes. Now I've arrived.    </segment7>
