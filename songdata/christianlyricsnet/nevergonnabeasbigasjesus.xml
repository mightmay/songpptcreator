		<segment1>I could move to Hollywood. get my teeth capped I know I could. be a big star on the silver screen. just like James Dean I could be a star. I could climb the corporate ladder. buy, sell, and liquidate. Maybe be just like the Beatles. melodic, rocking heavyweights. I could learn to sing and dance. if I only had a chance. I could be a big rock star</segment1>
		<segment2>I could be anything I wanted to. I wanted to. I could be anything but one thing's true</segment2>
		<segment3>Never gonna be as big as Jesus. never gonna hold the world in my hand. never gonna be as big as Jesus. never gonna build a promised land. but that's alright with me</segment3>
		<segment4>I could build a tower to heaven. get on top and touch the sky. I could write a million songs. all designed to glorify. I could be about as good. good as any human could. but that won't get me by.     </segment4>
