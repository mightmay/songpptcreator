		<segment1>when I wake up, I want to see you, I need to hear you, I want to live your life, in my day I fail to see, to seek the one who gives life, I've looked away from your grace, you've been waiting at the gates, I'm running, you're standing still, it's been so long since I've been here, it's time to came back again, it's time to make correction, slain to the past, recovery (ressurect me). undeserving, you love me still, you're love I love, I've run away 1000 times, I've run away for the last time, and I'm alone with bleeding and broken hands, it's been so long since I've seen your face    </segment1>
