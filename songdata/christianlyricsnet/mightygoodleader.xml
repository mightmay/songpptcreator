		<segment1>Flooded by an ocean. Of some mixed emotions. They got you down again. Pride and passion Physical attraction. Whatever thing you're in. These temptations Causing you frustrations. What you need is a friend. Someone who loves you Who is above you. Take away all your sin</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. Help is on the way. Help is on the way. A mighty good leader is on the way. He's the only one gonna come to save the day. It's all right, yeah, uh-huh, it's OK. 'Cause a mighty good leader is on the way</segment2>
		<segment3>Now this someone. Knows where you come from. Doesn't care where you've been. He can put back, pieces that you lack. Make you whole again.     </segment3>
