		<segment1>I'm not ashamed to tell the whole world, oh. Without you, I'm nothing at all. That I have strings in need of mending. I'm out of tune in certain parts. So strum the chords of mercy. Restore my soul completely. Lay your hand upon me. And this instrument will breathe</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. 'Cause you're the music of my heart. (Yeah yeah yeah yeah). The melody within my soul. (Yeah yeah yeah yeah). The song that holds me in the dark. (Yeah yeah yeah yeah). The fire that warms me when I'm cold. (Yeah yeah yeah yeah). The symphony that calms my fear. (Yeah yeah yeah yeah). The lyric that I long to hear. (Yeah yeah yeah yeah). The masterpiece, the work of art. Complete before I start. The music of my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah</segment3>
		<segment4>Creator of all that is lovely, oh. Write a tune upon my heart. And when you finish will you play me. Like a beautiful guitar?. Strum the chords of mercy. Restore my soul completely. Breathe life into me. And this instrument will sing</segment4>
		<segment5>[Repeat Chorus]</segment5>
		<segment6>. Of my heart. I'm captivated. (Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Heart). Of my heart. My soul's elated. (Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Heart). Of my heart. Because. Every single line's full of love divine. Write me like a valentine</segment6>
		<segment7>[Repeat Chorus]</segment7>
		<segment8>Yeah, the music of my heart. Of my heart. The music of my heart. Of my heart. The music of my heart    </segment8>
