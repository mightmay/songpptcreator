		<segment1>Its me running down your face. Its me that you know you cant replace. With all that the world has for you. Or with all in the world that you can </segment1>
		<segment2>Take, take, you cant take it anymore. Tell me what youre living for. Leave, leave, but when you come back home. Ill be here</segment2>
		<segment3>Its me giving you your space. Its me offering this grace. For the way that youve wasted all I gave. And the way that you waste all that you </segment3>
		<segment4>Ive been waiting for you. That someday you would come back home. Ive been waiting for you. Cause you cant make it on your own. Ive got a place prepared for you. You were lost, but now youre found. Ive got a place prepared for you</segment4>
