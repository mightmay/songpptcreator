		<segment1>Someone's calling you name. But you can't hear a sound. Cause you've allowed the noise to drown it out. Everywhere you go. You're never there. The thought of being afraid. Has you so scared</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: And all this time you've been looking for love. Love has been looking for you. Being still is your next move. Close your eyes and see the truth. You know that love is looking. Is looking for you. Yeah. Looking for you</segment2>
		<segment3>There's only one way. The path there is different For each of us. I don't know what you need. But you need Jesus, yeah. Will you ever learn. It doesn't matter what you know. The less there is of you. The more room there is to grow</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE: Can't you hear Him. Can't you hear Him calling out to you. Can't you feel Him. Can't you feel Him looking for you    </segment4>
