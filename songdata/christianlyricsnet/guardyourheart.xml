		<segment1>What appears to be a harmless glance. Can turn to romance. And homes are divided. Feelings that should never have been. Awaken within. Tearing the heart in two. Listen, I beg of you!</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Guard your heart, Guard your heart. Don't trade it for treasure. Don't give it away. Guard your heart, Guard your heart. As a payment for pleasure. It's a high price to pay. For a soul that remains sincere. With a conscience clear. Guard your heart</segment2>
		<segment3>The human heart is easily swayed. And often betrayed. At the hands of emotion. We dare not leave the outcome to chance. We must choose in advance. Or live with the agony. Such needless tragedy</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
