		<segment1>Let's play a little game. On scribbled paper. You guess the letters. And I'll draw the hanging man </segment1>
		<segment2>Hint number one is. Five letters inscribed over. The lips of eyeless woman. Asking me for needles and a thread to sew her head back together again. She reaches forward. And grabs a hold of my sleeve. Her antennae wrap around me. Her lungs infect me as she breathes.. </segment2>
		<segment3>The roadkill scent of violent city </segment3>
		<segment4>Oh swollen anthill sore. Insects desperate cries. Oh infected for. Doomsday stomp from the skies </segment4>
		<segment5>This town made its guesses. But can't spell her own name. A five letter word for the oncoming plague. A stick figure dangling from stoplight grave.     </segment5>
