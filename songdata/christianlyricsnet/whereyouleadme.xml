		<segment1>What is life?. A thousand roads, a thousand ways. Why am I so afraid to move. I crossed the line. I'm stepping out so come what may. I give it all cause I'm drawn to You</segment1>
		<segment2>As long as my heart is beating.. Where You lead me I will follow. Where You lead me I give my life away. Where You lead me I will follow. Forever and a day. Forever and a day</segment2>
		<segment3>I can't deny Your very presence is my life. And why would I ever turn away. Cause deep inside I know that I cannot rely. On anything less than faith</segment3>
		<segment4>As long as my heart is beating.. Where You lead me I will follow. Where You lead me I give my life away. Where You lead me I will follow. Forever and a day</segment4>
		<segment5>This is all I'm dreaming of. To live completely in Your love</segment5>
		<segment6>So this is life</segment6>
		<segment7>Where You lead me I give my life away. Where You lead me I will follow. Forever and a day</segment7>
		<segment8>Where You lead me I will follow. Where You lead me I give my life away. Where You lead me I will follow. Forever and a day. Forever and a day.     </segment8>
