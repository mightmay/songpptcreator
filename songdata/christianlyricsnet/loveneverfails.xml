		<segment1>Love is not proud. Love does not boast. Love after all. Matters the most</segment1>
		<segment2>Love does not run. Love does not hide. Love does not keep. Locked inside</segment2>
		<segment3>Love is the river that flows through. Love never fails you</segment3>
		<segment4>Love will sustain. Love will provide. Love will not cease. At the end of time</segment4>
		<segment5>Love will protect. Love always hopes. Love still believes. When you dont</segment5>
		<segment6>Love is the arms that are holding you. Love never fails you</segment6>
		<segment7>When my heart wont make a sound. When I cant turn back around. When the sky is falling down. Nothing is greater than this. Greater than this</segment7>
		<segment8>Love is right here. Love is alive. Love is the way. The truth the life</segment8>
		<segment9>Love is the river than flows through. Love is the arms that are holding you. Love is the place you will fly to. Love never fails you</segment9>
