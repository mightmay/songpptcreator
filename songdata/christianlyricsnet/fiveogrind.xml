		<segment1>Binded hands and a restrained mouth. Will I ever get out of this prison that I call my room?. And now I'm carried by my dreams. As foolish as it seems, you'll never change me. Another useless night. I guess I'll be alright as long as you stay here. More time not spent. My trouble never ends. I keep on thinking of you. Sometimes I'm wrong. I just wanna write you songs. Helping my brothers out. Sometimes I can't help but shout.     </segment1>
