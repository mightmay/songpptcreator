		<segment1>I keep trying to forget you, and I've found that I'm better since you're gone, I keep trying to forget you, I realize you're not the only one for me, how could you put me through hell and say you meant no harm to me, it would have been easier if it hadn't been so hard, every second counts for something, what about all those precious memories, the words &quot;I love you&quot; must mean nothing, I was blind, till you made me see the truth.     </segment1>
