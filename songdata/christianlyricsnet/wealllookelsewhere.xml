		<segment1>Lost sense of direction: nobody knows my name. Confidence: correction. I don't know how to play that game. A straight line is quicker. A straight line would make me fast. I've burned my nose enough to know that straight lines never last </segment1>
		<segment2>Swallow your soul. And drink from this life. As you choke on your pride. We all look elsewhere. We all look elsewhere </segment2>
		<segment3>It's safer inside doors, nobody has to flee. A broken vessel passed the rocks and out to sea. Waiting, wanting, mad with purpose. Now we come to talk to one who has the answer to how </segment3>
		<segment4>Swallow your soul. And drink from this life. As you choke on your pride </segment4>
		<segment5>Don't waste your time if you've got it. The tides are turning now. You are not alone. They gave you their worst and you bought it. The lie has been exposed. You are not alone </segment5>
		<segment6>Like winter that comes quick in early September. The rain clouds that washed me are what I remember. The stones that I threw piled high like a mountain. Which I had to climb before I reached the fountain. If life is a riddle then riddle me this. The blood tasted sweet as it passed by my lips </segment6>
		<segment7>Don't, don't waste your time. Don't, don't waste your time. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your time if you've got it. The tides are turning now. You are not alone. Liar, liar. They gave you their worst and you bought it. The lie has been exposed. You are not alone    </segment7>
