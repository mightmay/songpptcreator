		<segment1>Cant stop talking bout everything Hes done. Its the best thing, happened since the world began. It didnt come cheap but I got it for free. Its the hope of glory, Christ in me</segment1>
		<segment2>He helped me to see when my spirit was blind. Its amazing if you look just what youll find. Every step I took, He took two. If He did it for me, He can do it for you</segment2>
		<segment3>Do you know Him? (Yes, I do). Do you know what I say is true?. Do you know Him? (Yes, I do). If He did it for me, He can do it for you. (Verse)    </segment3>
