		<segment1>Something deep in me. Tells me that I'll never be. Happy with my life. Until I lose it. Look look looking back. I can see that I'm off track. Like a train that soon. Will meet disaster</segment1>
		<segment2>I feel like it's time. For me to be born again. Like a cocoon. I've spun my tomb. Thinking it's time to end</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't understand it. Don't understand it at all. Don't understand it. Don't understand it at all</segment3>
		<segment4>Oo-Ee-Oo-Ah-Ah</segment4>
		<segment5>When I think of it. I feel like a sinking ship. Knowing some day I'll be going under</segment5>
		<segment6>Something deep in me. Tells me that I'll never be. Happy with my life. Until I lose it. Look look looking back. I can see that I'm off track. Like a train that soon. Will meet disaster</segment6>
		<segment7>I feel like it's time. For me to be born again. Like a cocoon. I've spun my tomb. Thinking it's time to end</segment7>
		<segment8>Don't understand it. Don't understand it at all. Don't understand it. Don't understand it at all    </segment8>
