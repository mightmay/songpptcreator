		<segment1>This is my brand new day starting now. I let go the things that weigh me down. And rob me of the beauty that's to be found. And life all around</segment1>
		<segment2>Pre-Chorus: This is my prayer without ceasing. The negative releasing. And as I rise above. My burden is easing</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I bring the pure flow, water around. The rocks of life won't pull me down. I bring the pure flow, drink so deep. The river of life my soul at ease. I bring the pure flow, water around. The rocks of life won't pull me down. I bring the pure flow, rising above. The storms of life to live and love</segment3>
		<segment4>This is my brand new day in the light. Troubles rising up on the left and the right. I keep my eyes fixed on where I want to go. The rest will follow</segment4>
		<segment5>Pre-Chorus. Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>This is my brand new day starting now. Letting go of the ways that I fall down. The old can be made new, the lost can be found. The lost will be found</segment6>
		<segment7>Pre-Chorus. Chorus</segment7>
		<segment8>My soul is at ease and I am free</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus    </segment9>
