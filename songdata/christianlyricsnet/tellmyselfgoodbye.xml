		<segment1>These words roll of my tongue like second nature. But I'm far from my womb, and you know I'm far from you. So when do I come back to you?. Was this already written or have I fallen so far. I can't tell the light from the dark.</segment1>
		<segment2>I thought you had me forever. But I'm sure you thought the same about me. And I'm sorry, so sorry.</segment2>
		<segment3>These dreams run through my head that frolic through some tube of my brain. I'm going insane, I've forgotten my name. So I'll use yours, like a dropped friend I wish I never left. I wish I never left you. I wish I never left you. I can't tell the light from the dark.</segment3>
		<segment4>I thought you had me forever. But I'm sure you thought the same about me. And I'm sorry, so sorry.</segment4>
		<segment5>Winter's come early this year. Like a bird in the rain, I've tortured my everything.</segment5>
		<segment6>The rain falls, and I never meant to leave you standing.    </segment6>
