		<segment1>I was wasting time. Oh so sure to find somebody who'll. Never go. How could I know. None I'd found was true. None could be but you. The only one love divine. My heart, my mind are yours </segment1>
		<segment2>Everywhere I go I see your face through the crowd. Everywhere I go I hear your voice clear and loud. Everywhere I go you are the light that I seek. Everywhere I go you have found me </segment2>
		<segment3>Where could my heart go. Where you wouldn't be. Where you wouldn't know to find me?. Far, far from here. Still you are near. Still you are near to me. And I see. I have seen you in the morning. In the guiding light you hold me. Closer than the air around me. You surround me always    </segment3>
