		<segment1>Another Day slips away. and i get this feeling that nothing has changed. but these years keep coming like waves. they wash over me day after day. i just watch them rolling by. standing here beneath the sky</segment1>
		<segment2>and i cant hold the hands of time. they will move like they will move. but i can hold your hand in mine. give my time and give my heart. its all that i can do</segment2>
		<segment3>another night is flying by. somebody's born, somebody dies. i wanna look deep in your eyes. i wanna live and i want to cry </segment3>
		<segment4>and i cant hold the hands of time. they will move like they will move. but i can hold your hand in mine. give my time and give my heart. its all that i can do</segment4>
		<segment5>ill just watch it rolling by. here with you beneath the sky</segment5>
		<segment6>and i cant hold the hands of time. they will move like they will move. but i can hold your hand in mine. give my time and give my heart. its all that i can do</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, take my time. Take my heart. Cuz they belong to you. It's all that I can do</segment7>
