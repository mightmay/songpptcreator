		<segment1>You're cold that way. And that's why you say. The things that you say. You can't attract. The things that you lack. You're trying in vain </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: It seems it's always the crazy times. You find you'll wake up and realize. It takes more than your saline eyes. To make things right </segment2>
		<segment3>You spiral down. You've broken your crown. You don't feel like a queen. You've seen the proof. But you're still crying wolf. You'll never believe </segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus] </segment4>
		<segment5>You try to climb a broken ladder. Grip the missing rungs. And fall down, down, down. Seems sometime ago you said. This wouldn't last. And now you sit here crying </segment5>
		<segment6>Beside your bed. You feel left for dead. You kneel in the dark.. </segment6>
		<segment7>It takes more than your saline eyes. To make things right </segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus]     </segment8>
