		<segment2>Well this goes out to everybody. Who came to swing when we rock this party. It don't matta if ya 14 or 40. What we gonna do is just get this started. It's the Krutch brothas gettin mad retarded, If ya don't like it then disregard it. Stay true to what we believe, we never parted, And we still rockin' mics just like we started </segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). When up comes down, Shake it like an earthquake. Turn a-round. Nothing can stop you. When up comes down, Shake it like an earthquake. Turn a-round. Nothing can stop you. NOW!! </segment3>
		<segment4>It stays on just like the stage we blaze on. Light it like napalm, Thousand Foot up in tha maison. Holy terror prepare yourself for the storm. You know it's on when the Krutch drops tha bomb, yo. We can get the show on, Right here, no fear. Rockin the party on. From tha floor to tha chandelier. Check the word. Don't just settle for video, Can I get a yo?. Shake it down thru tha millennium </segment4>
