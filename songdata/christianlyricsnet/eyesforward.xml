		<segment1>Jumped in the car slammed on the gas. Got to get away from here real fast. The enemy is breathing down my neck. Trying to grab a hold and make my wreck. Hot on my tail trying to make my fail. Trying to take the wind up out of my sail. Trying to run me off this road</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Eyes forward. Don't look at whats behind. Eyes forward. Don't take your eyes off the prize</segment2>
		<segment3>Well the pressures bleeding in. Giving me some blurry vision. Fogging up my intellect. Where love and hate they intersect. Keep the path of the mission. Never going to lose my ambition. Got my eyes up on the prize</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Eyes forward. Don't look at whats behind. Eyes forward. Don't take your eyes off the prize    </segment4>
