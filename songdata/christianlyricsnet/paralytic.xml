		<segment1>Paint the lines on perfect eyes that circle the object of. My sincere affection, my undivided attention. </segment1>
		<segment2>Lie where you wont see yourself in that way. And well ride to somewhere. </segment2>
		<segment3>All we are is paralyzed from the face down. Were still alive with our fake smiles. When the cameras away. </segment3>
		<segment4>Dont remember this. No, dont remember this. We are losing it all, but we are gaining the world with our hands tied. Your arms placed upon mine. And the sky looks so right, and youre mine tonight. </segment4>
		<segment5>Lie where you wont see yourself in that way. And well ride.. </segment5>
		<segment6>All we are is paralyzed from the face down. Were still alive with our fake smiles. When the cameras away.     </segment6>
