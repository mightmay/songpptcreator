		<segment1>O Come &amp; Mourn With Me Awhile (Our Lord Is Crucified)</segment1>
		<segment2>Words by Frederick W. Faber Music by Eric Ashley</segment2>
		<segment3>O Come and Mourn with me awhile. O come near to the Savior's side. O come together, let us mourn. Jesus our lord is crucified</segment3>
		<segment4>Seven times he spoke. Seven words of love. And all three hours, his silence cried. For mercy on the souls of men. Jesus our Lord is crucified</segment4>
		<segment5>O Love of God O sin of man. In this dread act your strength is tried. And victory remains with love. Jesus our lord is crucified</segment5>
		<segment6>O break, O break hard heart of mind. My weak self love and guilty pride. His Pilate and his Judas were. Jesus our lord is crucified</segment6>
		<segment7>O love of god o sin of man. In this dread act your strength is tried. And victory remains in love. Jesus our lord is crucified</segment7>
		<segment8>O Come and mourn with me awhile. A broken heart a fount of tears. Ask and they will not be denied. A broken heart love's cradle is. Jesus our Lord is crucified. Jesus our Lord is crucified. Jesus our Lord is crucified. Our Lord is crucified. And victory remains with love. Jesus our lord is crucified. O love of God o sin of man. In this dread act your strength is tried. And victory remains with love. Jesus our lord is crucified    </segment8>
