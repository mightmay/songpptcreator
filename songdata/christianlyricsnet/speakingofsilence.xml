		<segment1>There's a stillness in my heart. And a quiet in my soul. That I never stop to hear. There's a whisper crying out. Through a silent microphone. And it never disappears</segment1>
		<segment2>Speaking of silence</segment2>
		<segment3>We just play the music loud. We listen to the crowd. We laugh to numb the pain we share. And we know that talk is easy. It's the loneliness we fear. We could listen but we're scared. are you there</segment3>
		<segment4>coming down to the ground. kneeling down i can hear the sound. of your voice. here to find the time to realign. quiet the deafening lies. Lord i need you</segment4>
		<segment5>whisper softly. hold me gently in your arms. and cradle me with love</segment5>
		<segment6>hold me close. let me feel you breathe. overwhelming love. come speak to me. take my love rid me of my hate. still my beating heart. Lord kiss my face. take these tears. you've got to set me free. raise new life. to all the dead places inside me. hold me close. i need to feel you breathe. calm these storms that. rage inside of me    </segment6>
