		<segment1>I lay in a bed of resistance. Chained to either side. I really wish I could reset rewind. Someone has clawed out my eyes. Can't identify. I really wish I could reset rewind. You know it's never the way we planned it. I really wish we could reset rewind.</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm planning a revolution inside my head!. I'm planning a revolution when I break free. I call for annihilation. Describe the sunlight so I can feel it's burn. If only I could get up from this bed</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't know what they told you. But this place is not what you think. Reset Rewind!</segment3>
		<segment4>Living inside a hole they put me underground. Where they can never find me 'less they dig me out.</segment4>
		<segment5>I search for the answers 'cause this is the end. I search for the answers!</segment5>
		<segment6>God! It's caving in on me!. I feel them watching!. But no one seems to care anymore!. I'm digging, I'm digging my way out. 'Cause when I breathe in there is no release!</segment6>
		<segment7>I can't believe this, I can't believe this. My mind is starting to turn on me!</segment7>
		<segment8>I've been living inside a hole they put me underground. Where they could never find me 'less they dig me out. I've been living inside a hole. Where they could never find me 'less they dig me out.    </segment8>
