		<segment1>Like the water's roar. Is Your voice, O Lord. There is none before. And none beside</segment1>
		<segment2>You are set apart. You alone are God. Your glory reaches far. From sky to sky</segment2>
		<segment3>Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty. Early in the morning we will sing. Holy, Holy, we bow down before Thee. All Your children love to sing Your name. God Almighty</segment3>
		<segment4>You're the breath of life. You're the God on high. Your song shall rise. And never pass away</segment4>
		<segment5>O, Your Majesty. Evermore shall be. The earth, the skies, the sea. Shall bring You praise</segment5>
		<segment6>And I hide my eyes. With my face to the ground. In the presence of Your Majesty. And I clap my hands. And I lay my crowns. In the presence of Your Majesty.     </segment6>
