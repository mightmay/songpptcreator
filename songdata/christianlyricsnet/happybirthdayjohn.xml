		<segment1>Happy birthday John. Where has your sweetheart gone. She left you day with one week's pay and a boy she calls your son. Let's not wait for your invitation, pour yourself a drink. And think. About what happened. Happy birthday John. The warning lights were on. But you were far too gone. To notice what went wrong. Let's not wait for your invitation, pour yourself a drink. And think. About what happened </segment1>
		<segment2>Happy birthday John. Where has your sweetheart gone. The warning signs were on. Well happy birthday John. Let's not wait for your invitation, pour yourself a drink. And think. About what happened </segment2>
		<segment3>Let's not wait for your invitation, well pour yourself a drink. And think. About what happened    </segment3>
