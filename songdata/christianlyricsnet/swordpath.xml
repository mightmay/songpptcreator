		<segment1>You sink your teeth deeper your grips even tighter now I played the fool over and over again on your stage in your cage I see the same image everyday no matter what there's a price to pay you live a good life that is what you say straight towards your swordpath in line with all the others what's the difference anyway it doesn't matter what i say it only matters what i do one the path for punishment like a lamb to the slaughter on the path for your judgment you're walking in the swordpath of the vengeance of god.    </segment1>
