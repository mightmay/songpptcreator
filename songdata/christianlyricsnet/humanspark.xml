		<segment1>God, for the love of me. I don't know why. We hurt each other. In the name of what is right. Oh what we think is right. God, for the life of Man's inhumanity to man</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). There's a river of sorrow. Running thru my heart. Thru the long night I will follow. The glimmer in the dark. Lord, You are the human spark</segment2>
		<segment3>God, for the life of me. I cannot explain. How people born of love. Lose there way to hate. Oh there's go to be a better way    </segment3>
