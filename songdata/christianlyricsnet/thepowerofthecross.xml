		<segment1>Oh, to see the dawn. Of the darkest day: Christ on the road to Calvary. Tried by sinful men, Torn and beaten, then. Nailed to a cross of wood.</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: This, the pow'r of the cross: Christ became sin for us;. Took the blame, bore the wrath. We stand forgiven at the cross.</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, to see the pain. Written on Your face, Bearing the awesome weight of sin. Ev'ry bitter thought, Ev'ry evil deed. Crowning Your bloodstained brow. </segment3>
		<segment4>Now the daylight flees;. Now the ground beneath. Quakes as its Maker bows His head. Curtain torn in two, Dead are raised to life;. &quot;Finished!&quot; the vict'ry cry. </segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, to see my name. Written in the wounds, For through Your suffering I am free. Death is crushed to death;. Life is mine to live, Won through Your selfless love.</segment5>
		<segment6>FINAL CHORUS: This, the pow'r of the cross: Son of Godslain for us. What a love! What a cost!. We stand forgiven at the cross.    </segment6>
