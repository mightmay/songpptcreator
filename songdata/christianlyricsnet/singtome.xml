		<segment1>The song you sing. Orchestrates in perfect harmony. A verse that shines of brilliance. Whispers every moment subtly</segment1>
		<segment2>You compose a symphony. Playing with notes that are in key. A sound that will not be forgot. Defining clarity so</segment2>
		<segment3>Sing to me this melody. I'll let the rhythm take control. Sing to me this melody. A rhythm I have never known</segment3>
		<segment4>A love song like no other one. Resounds on in time. Your design it lights up the distance. Signaling the noise to help me find</segment4>
		<segment5>The words I can't ignore. So I'll sing along in a discord. Every measure, beat after beat. I'm slowly learning more so</segment5>
		<segment6>Sing to me this melody. I'll let the rhythm take control. Sing to me this melody. A rhythm I have never known</segment6>
		<segment7>This harmony rises up in me</segment7>
		<segment8>Sing to me this melody. I'll let the rhythm take control. Sing to me this melody. A rhythm I have never known    </segment8>
