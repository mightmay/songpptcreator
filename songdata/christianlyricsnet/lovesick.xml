		<segment1>Desire burning in my mind. Like a firefly lighting up the sky. My heart is aglow. I feel you burning up my soul. I'm a shipwreck. A sailor lost at sea. You're a tidal wave. And you're crashing over me. Caught in your current and I'm sinking. But drowning peacefully. Crying out come rescue me with love. Like a child needs a night light in the dark. Lord light me up I'm lovesick for just one touch. You're all I need but you never seem to be enough. I'm Romeo, desperate for your touch. I'd scale these garden walls just to see the rising sun. But see what light breaks softly through. It's love that I never knew.     </segment1>
