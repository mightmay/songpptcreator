		<segment1>Take your time, your on your own. And I'll be watching you as you sleep late tonight. The feeling's only natural. To defile something that is beautiful.</segment1>
		<segment2>Creep in my mind to control now. Feel their power grip, moral slip. As we let go now. Setting traps, regret, mark get set. As time marches on</segment2>
		<segment3>Cleansing day, Wash your hands from wrong investments that were made. But rivers flow from high to low. And I can feel the elevation. Drop below.</segment3>
		<segment4>Fall in my arms to control now. Feel a downward grip, moral slip. As we let go now. Setting traps, regret, mark get set. As time marches on</segment4>
		<segment5>We will raid. We will see. We will do. We all fall down. And we all fall down. And as time marches on</segment5>
		<segment6>Take my thoughts now. Take my thoughts now. Take all my thoughts and control them I say</segment6>
		<segment7>Bare me intent. To control now. Give me joy of light. Why wouldn't I?</segment7>
		<segment8>As we let go now. Traps instead with death. Pleasures sent. As time marches on. I will raid. I will see. I will be. They all fall down. And they all fall down. And they all fall down</segment8>
