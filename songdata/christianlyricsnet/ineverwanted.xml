		<segment1>I never wanted. And I never cared before. Now take it all back. This is a new day</segment1>
		<segment2>How I long to regress. To the days before I took upon myself. The obsessions of this world. A day of innocence equating beauty. For tomorrow may fall. And today is already gone</segment2>
		<segment3>Now take it back. This is a new day</segment3>
		<segment4>I've grown tired of chasing. Convinced I was in need. And now the years I've spent. Only a slave to this. Tomorrow may fall. And today is already gone. I will no longer adore. These things that will never satisfy me</segment4>
		<segment5>I have seen my world change. And then go back to where it came. In this vicious circle. We are all brought back to life. Only to die again. But without these barren obsessions. I am simply free    </segment5>
