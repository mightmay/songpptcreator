		<segment1>look inside. see where the pain still lies. forget me. then watch me fall down, down. if what we wanted was the end. then that makes sense now. but what if we had never stood so far apart. i should have know i'll never know </segment1>
		<segment2>i can take this fracture. i can turn it into strength. i can gnaw between sutures. i can keep this wound forever </segment2>
		<segment3>talk to me. talk to me. talk to me. through the hours. through the ages. i will sit in judgment of the cowardice i've shown. never falter. never displace blame. i will face myself head on and i will bare the shame </segment3>
		<segment4>cry tonight. force back the tears and sigh. this advice. is like flowers on a grave. if all we did was play pretend. then that makes sense now. but what if we had never stood so far apart. i should have known i'll never know </segment4>
		<segment5>it's only lies. that we've lost between us. it's only lies. that we've lost between us. it's only lies. that we've lost between us </segment5>
		<segment6>.     </segment6>
