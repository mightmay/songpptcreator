		<segment1>Something brought you to my mind today. I thought about the funny ways you make me laugh. And yet I feel like it's okay to cry with you. Something about just being with you. When I leave I feel like I've been near God. And that's the way it ought to be.. </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: 'Cause you've been more than a friend to me. You fight off my enemies. 'Cause you've spoken the Truth over my life. And you'll never know what it means to me. Just to know you've been on your knees for me. Oh, you have blessed my life. More than you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah. More than you'll ever know, yeah, yeah, yeah </segment2>
		<segment3>You had faith, when I had none. You prayed God would bring me a brand new song. When I didn't think I could find the strength to sing. And all the while I'm hoping that I'll. Do the kind of praying for you that you've done for me. And that's the way it ought to be.. </segment3>
		<segment4>You have carried me. You have taken upon a bruden that wasn't your own. And may the blessing return to you. A hundredfold, oh yeah.. A hundredfold, oh yeah..     </segment4>
