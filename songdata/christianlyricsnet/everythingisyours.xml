		<segment1>When all the world is blossoming. And everything around is bursting into life. And I don't have to strain to hear the beat of Your heart</segment1>
		<segment2>When all the world is under fire. When skies are threatening to thunder and rain. And I am overcome by fears that I can't see</segment2>
		<segment3>If everything is Yours. Everything is Yours. If everything is Yours. I'm letting it go. No, it was never mine to hold. No, never mine</segment3>
		<segment4>Who could command the stars to sing. Or hold the raging seas from breaking through the doors?. And tend the fragile roses with the very same hands</segment4>
		<segment5>If everything is Yours. Everything is Yours. If everything is Yours. I'm letting it go. I am, I'm letting it go, letting go. Yeah, I'm letting it go</segment5>
		<segment6>'Cause everything is Yours. Yeah, everything is Yours</segment6>
		<segment7>If everything is Yours, God. And everything is Yours. If everything is Yours. I'm letting it go, let it go, let it go, let it go</segment7>
		<segment8>It was never mine, no, no. It was never mine, never mine. [Incomprehensible] no    </segment8>
