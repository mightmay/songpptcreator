		<segment1>Almost there, almost where I'm supposed to be. It's not all clear, but you keep showing me. With every step, the more my heart moves to your beat. Just like where I'm headed, there's joy in the journey</segment1>
		<segment2>Teach me to think like you think. Show me the things that are true [ohh]. Finish the work you have started in me. As I'm on my way to you. As I'm on my way to you</segment2>
		<segment3>Create in me a pure heart and make me new. Less of me, Jesus more of you. Here I stand, still I'm drawn down to my knees. It's not my strength, but Your's that carries me</segment3>
		<segment4>Teach me to think like to you think. Show me the things that are true. Finish the work you have started in me. As I'm on my way to you. As I'm on my way to you. Yes I'm on my way to you</segment4>
		<segment5>Teach me to think like to you think. Show me the things that are true. Finish the work you have started in me. As I'm on my way to you. As I'm on my way to you. Yes I'm on my way to you</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm on my way (3x). I'm on my way to you    </segment6>
