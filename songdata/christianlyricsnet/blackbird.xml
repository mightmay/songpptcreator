		<segment1>Blackbird, why you wearing that frown?. Don't you know Jesus loves you and me. and the preacher on T.V. you're putting down</segment1>
		<segment2>Blackbird, how I love to hear your songs. I could spend all of my time in the shade. of the trees and listen all day long</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: But you're ever hearing, never understanding. Ever seeing, not perceiving and your heart. has grown callous. You're in a storm and lost you way. Won't you fly to heaven and be saved today</segment3>
		<segment4>Blackbird, now you're broken your wing. You try to fly high but you know that you. can't go anywhere, you can't do anything</segment4>
		<segment5>Blackbird, who put you in your cage. Tell me, was it God or was it you. Was it me? I guess it don't matter anyway</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>(Bridge) You say you need a remedy. for the thorn in your pride. I think it's such a tragedy. That you have left Him behind</segment7>
		<segment8>You say you'd light you candle. But your love light doesn't shine. You say you talk to angels. Well I say it's such a lie</segment8>
		<segment9>Repeat chorus    </segment9>
