		<segment1>Went on down to penny lane. Just me your picture and the rain. I told you all about my day. You smiled at all I had to say</segment1>
		<segment2>And I decided that. You're much nicer on Kodak paper. You're always smiling at me. You're much nicer on Kodak paper. I really wish you could be. Like the girl in your picture</segment2>
		<segment3>Called you on the telephone. You said you'd like to be left alone. So I pulled out your picture again. And told you all the stuff I was in</segment3>
		<segment4>And then I told you. You're much nicer on Kodak paper. You're always smiling at me. You're much nicer on Kodak paper. I really wish you could be. Like the girl in your picture. Like the girl in your picture</segment4>
		<segment5>You had a bad relation. Were not meant to be. I think that late play. And I agree that</segment5>
		<segment6>You're much nicer on Kodak paper. You're always smiling at me. You're much nicer on Kodak paper. I really wish you could be</segment6>
		<segment7>You're much nicer on Kodak paper. You're always smiling at me. You're much nicer on Kodak paper. I really wish you could be. Like the girl in your picture. Like the girl in your picture. Like the girl in your picture. Like the girl in your picture. Like the girl in your picture     </segment7>
