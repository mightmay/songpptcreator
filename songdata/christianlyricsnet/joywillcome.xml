		<segment1>Joy will come in the morning. Riding on the wings of the dawn. I know. Joy will come after mourning. As surely as You are God</segment1>
		<segment2>Joy will come believe. Joy will come joy will come</segment2>
		<segment3>Joy will come like the harvest. Reaping for tears that we sow. I know. Joy will run to the farthest place. Surely as You are God</segment3>
		<segment4>What is this hope I feel. It's helping</segment4>
		<segment5>What is this peace beyond. Understanding. You fix the broken heart. There's healing in Your wings</segment5>
		<segment6>What is this whisper small. I'm hearing. So far above it all. It's speaking. You're still the sovereign Lord. There's healing in Your wings    </segment6>
