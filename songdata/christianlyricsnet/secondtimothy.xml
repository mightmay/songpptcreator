		<segment1>Hangin' round, found a Bible on the shelf. And I had so much time to sit and read it for myself and there it was. My Bible verified my very thoughts. All Scripture is inspired. I saw Second Timothy, yeah. Verse 3:16, itÂ’s right there. Who says that there's previous errors in my Old Test'ment?. You know it surely isn't me (yeah). Mama, they should read 3:16 (dig it). Bring it down, down from off your shelf. And go read verse 3:16 in Second Timothy yourself. Go there because. Cause that verse demonstrates. Oh, yes it does. All Scripture's heaven-made. I saw Second Timothy, yeah. Who's got doubts cause -- it's quite clear. Who says that there's grev-i-ous errors in my Old Test'ment?. Mama, it surely isn't me (yeah). Mama, they should read 3:16 (dig it). I saw Second Timothy, yeah. Who's got doubts cause it's right there. Who says that there's devious errors in my Old Test'ment?. Mama, it surely isn't me (yeah). Yeah, mama, they should read 3:16. Yeah, mama, it shows you what I mean. Yeah, mama, I trust what I read    </segment1>
