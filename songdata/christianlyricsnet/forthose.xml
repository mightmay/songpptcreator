		<segment1>For those who are worn with nothing to bring but empty hands. For those who are weak, for those who can't find the strength to stand</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). Lord we know it's for those You've come. Lord we know it's for those You've given Your Son. Lord we know it's for those who can't come on their own. That You've come, You have come for those</segment2>
		<segment3>For those who are poor. For those who are broken, those who mourn. For those bound by chains with no way to freedom but for grace. But for grace</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>If You are for us, who can be against us. Who can be against Your own. If You are with us who can separate us. Who can separate Your own</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus).     </segment6>
