		<segment1>Another day. Another sunrise. Another factory call. Another night. Another sunset. Another freefall</segment1>
		<segment2>In my life. In my own purpose. Within the weakness. Within the weakness</segment2>
		<segment3>Spinning out in circles. In circles, in circles. Spinning out in circles. In circles, in circles</segment3>
		<segment4>Another day. Another lifetime. Another engine stalls. Another line. Another freeway. Another freefall</segment4>
		<segment5>In my life. In my own purpose. Within the weakness. Within the weakness</segment5>
		<segment6>Spinning out in circles. In circles, in circles. Spinning out in circles. In circles, in circles. In circles, in circles</segment6>
		<segment7>I've lost all that I wanted to leave. I've lost all that I wanted to be. Don't that there's nothing this true. Don't believe in this modern machine. The modern machine</segment7>

		<segment9>Spinning, Spinning. In circles, in circles. Spinning out in circles. In circles, in circles. In circles, in circles    </segment9>
