		<segment1>You're the wonder and the mystery. You're the melody that must be sung. We rejoice with all those who believe. You're the song that was and is to come </segment1>
		<segment2>Glory is rising. Yeah glory is rising. Beautiful beautiful the sound. Of redemption's song. Moving through the crowd. Singing great is our god. Your children crying out. Beautiful beautiful the sound </segment2>
		<segment3>From the earth our voices will ascend. As an offering to you alone. May our praises echo without end. Join the angel choir around the throne </segment3>
