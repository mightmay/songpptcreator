		<segment1>There's a secret I must tell. Of all the love I've found. And it's hidden in my heart. The day you tore my world apart</segment1>
		<segment2>Hallelujah, King forever, friend and Saviour</segment2>
		<segment3>Jesus' blood never fails me, Jesus' blood never fails me, Jesus' blood, Jesus' blood</segment3>
		<segment4>And this secret, it will run. To the corners of the earth. Where every woman, every son. Will carry high their chains undone</segment4>
		<segment5>Hallelujah, King forever, friend and Saviour</segment5>
		<segment6>Jesus' blood never fails me, Jesus' blood never fails me, Jesus' blood never fails me, Jesus' blood, Jesus' blood</segment6>
		<segment7>Sing your songs of freedom. Praise the God of heaven. Love that never fails me. Jesus' blood, Jesus' blood    </segment7>
