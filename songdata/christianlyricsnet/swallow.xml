		<segment1>Been waiting and now you're sinking slow. Been watching how you rated me low. You say water is supposed to be brown. I say there's garbage in the fountain</segment1>
		<segment2>Taste and swallow down</segment2>
		<segment3>Been wanted for thinking slow. You've been longing for an open window. So get out throw out. You're thirsty no doubt. But you have to taste and swallow down.     </segment3>
