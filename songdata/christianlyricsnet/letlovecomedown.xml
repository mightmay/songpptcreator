		<segment1>Listen to the way that I sound when I say what I mean. Cause I'm bound by the things that I see. On the ground her waiting. You could be the one, pick me up when you come down to me. Cause I'm down for the count on my knees. And there's no more faking</segment1>
		<segment2>Is it over? Is it over?</segment2>
		<segment3>I need you now (or it's all over). Right here right now (or it's all over)</segment3>
		<segment4>Listen to the sound of my heart when I found I was free. Cause it starts with the love that I need. See me brought to life. Animate my soul, see my colors unfold at Your feet. Life is fuller when love's indiscreet. In its sacrifice</segment4>
		<segment5>Is it over? Is it over?</segment5>
		<segment6>I need you now (or it's all over). Right here right now (or it's all over). Let love come down</segment6>
		<segment7>Is it over? It's never over    </segment7>
