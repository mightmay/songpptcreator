		<segment1>(Chorus). Heaven sent me a wonderful, very special, beautiful gift. Heaven sent me a very wonderful, supernatural, special friend. (Verse 1). When I call Him, He answers prayer. And whenever I need Him, He is right there. And His love has lifted me. Higher than I thought I could ever be. He is so wonderful, beautiful, special, supernatural. (Chorus). (Verse 2). When I was in prison, he set me free. I was blinded in darkness, He let me see. I've been through so many storms, He's brought me through. And the same thing that He did for me, He'll do for you. He is so wonderful, beautiful, special, supernatural. (Chorus). (Vamp). Jesus    </segment1>
