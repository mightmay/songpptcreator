		<segment1>. I'm falling just as fast as you</segment1>
		<segment2>When all that's left is blame. There is nothing to do but escape. The light burned out on us a few weeks back. The light burned out on us a few weeks ago. Lucky for us, lucky for us</segment2>
		<segment3>Hopelessness has left us falling. Don't look to me, I'm falling just as fast as you</segment3>
		<segment4>I wish I could help you honey. I really do, but just what am I to do. If we really are one in the same. And we have forced each other. Into all of these mistakes. We're gonna need somebody else to do our saving</segment4>
		<segment5>Hopelessness has left us falling. With nothing to cling to. Don't look to me, I'm falling just as fast. Hopelessness has left us falling. Don't look to me, I'm falling just as fast as you</segment5>
		<segment6>The vultures are set on my flesh. They're tearing at the faith in my chest     </segment6>
