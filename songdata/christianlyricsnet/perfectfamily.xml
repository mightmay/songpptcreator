		<segment1>There was this boy, his name was Jerry. He had a girl, her name was Sally. They were so happy, so much in love. Drank Coca-Cola in his mini bus. A few years later, they got married. They had two kids and a dog named Spot. They were so happy, so much in love. Put their kids to bed and went and watched Ben Hur.</segment1>
		<segment2>The perfect family, Jerry and Sally. The perfect family. The perfect family, Jerry and Sally. The perfect family</segment2>
		<segment3>Sally and Jerry sure been through a lot. But they remember their promise to God. Jerry's getting older now, losing his hair. Losing his teeth, but Sally really doesn't care.     </segment3>
