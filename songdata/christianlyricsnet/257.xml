		<segment1>Sixteen never came. He just wanted to be understood. His mother knew his name. But never found the time to love her son. Of all the things in the world</segment1>
		<segment2>We just need someone. We are more than wandering lives, shadows in the dark. We all need someone to carry each other through it all. Everybody needs someone</segment2>
		<segment3>She was twenty three. When she lost herself out to the streets. Red light nights just to survive. All she wanted was a friend to talk to late at night. Of all the things in the world</segment3>
		<segment4>We just need someone. We are more than wandering lives, shadows in the dark. We all need someone to carry each other through it all. Everybody needs someone</segment4>
		<segment5>All the things in the world. All the dreams in the world</segment5>
		<segment6>We just need someone. We are more than wandering lives, shadows in the dark. We all need someone to carry each other through it all. Everybody needs someone    </segment6>
