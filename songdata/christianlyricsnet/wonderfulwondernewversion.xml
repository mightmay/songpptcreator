		<segment1>I don't know the ocean's crystal blue, and I don't climb the mountains for the view. Or wish upon the stars above my head, or bear witness to a marvelous sunset</segment1>
		<segment2>But the very thought of things I've never seen, Is all it takes to bring me to my knees.</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). Oh what a wonderful wonder, A display of great beauty and power. Oh what a wonderful wonder. You are to me</segment3>
		<segment4>I wish that I could see life through your eyes. To gaze upon the canvas from your side. To understand all that you've done before. And to realize the plans you have in store.</segment4>
		<segment5>And when I long to know what I don't see. You give me the courage to believe.</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>I can hardly wait until the time. when you will turn my darkness into light. and I'll finally find my way to heaven's door. where I won't need my faith anymore.</segment7>
		<segment8>And when my eyes behold your majesty. I'll join with the angels and we'll sing</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus)    </segment9>
