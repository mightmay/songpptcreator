		<segment1>I turn my head, there's nothing there. All I own is my thoughts for my fears. I close the door to keep out the bad. I plug my ears to keep out these fears</segment1>
		<segment2>And I cryÂ…</segment2>
		<segment3>So hold me close for I'm so tired of holding myself. So very tired and tired, tired and tired. Just hold me. (Repeat)</segment3>
		<segment4>I listen to these voices or is it this. house that's giving me chills, As I lie upon this little girls bed. Who's at the door? Who's walking near?. Or has my imagination spilled?. This little girl all grown up still fears</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh and I cry!</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS(2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>Where can I go where can I hide. from these evil sufferings?. Oh these images painted on my walls. They say there's a place that I can. hide in the shadow of your wings. Oh Lord, bring me to this place of refuge</segment7>
		<segment8>No more tears.</segment8>
		<segment9>CHORUS(4x)    </segment9>
