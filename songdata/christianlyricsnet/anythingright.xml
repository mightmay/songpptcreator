		<segment1>So much to say so little time for me to explain the way I feel. You only see things the way you want to see them. It makes sense to you all these things you do. You got it all figured out while everyone is confused. How do you do it?. In your mind I'm just blind. You're right all of the time. If I think for myself, I guess I'm way out of line. I'm not who you are. I'm so sorry </segment1>
		<segment2>chorus: I can't do anything right. You don't know me, stay out of my life. Kick me while I'm down, I want you to. I can't be like you. Don't want to be like you </segment2>
		<segment3>No matter what I do it's never good enough. I give all that is me; still it's never enough. So, why try? I give up. What does it feel like to be in you shoes. And walk over everyone like you do?. Tear me down again, I want you to. You're lovely, so beautiful. You're perfect in every way. Your interior rusted. I'm so disgusted. Can't trust it. You're busted.     </segment3>
