		<segment1>This road is worn it's a long walk to home. Rest seems lost on my own. The world has no mercy for me. All I need is something to live for and stand by. A love that's true. I have passion for freedom. I want truth to set me free. This is where my feet slip. Where's my devotion to you?. What's truth. belief?</segment1>
		<segment2>The point that stands. Beginning, reason. It's the breaking of a heart. I've been put down and let down. But I've been touched cared for and held onto. Cried many times &quot;make this right&quot;. Words were whispered &quot;then change your fight&quot;. All these things tie me down. &quot;Hope deferred make the heart sick&quot;. So keep me strong and sleeping on through the night    </segment2>
