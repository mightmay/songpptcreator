		<segment1>Chorus: I will wait for the promise, look to the sky. Wait for the promise and leave every lie, Hope for the future and try as I pray. To wait for the promise and live for the day.</segment1>
		<segment2>We all can speak our minds, about struggles we have known. I guess I have walked a few miles, in deserts of my own. but through the toughest times, the manna still comes down. How could I ever doubt, all the faith I've found</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>With every step I take, there's provision for my need. A daily glimpse of glory, for my eyes to see. I know when life deceives, the manna will be real. I can never doubt, all the faith I feel</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Gonna loose all my fears, let the winds. They come from far away. Gonna dry all my tears, trust the promise God gave. Gonna wait for the promise</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus x2    </segment7>
