		<segment1>Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue. thought I heard you talking softly. I turned on the lights the TV and the radio. but still I can't escape the ghost of you</segment1>
		<segment2>What is happening to me crazy some would say. Where is the life that I recognize, gone away</segment2>
		<segment3>And I won't cry for yesterday. there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive</segment3>
		<segment4>Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say. pride will tear us both apart. Well now pride's gone out the window. cross the rooftops, runaway. Left me in the vacuum of my heart</segment4>
		<segment5>What is happening to me crazy some will say. where is my friend when I need you most gone away</segment5>
		<segment6>But I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world. I will learn to survive</segment6>
		<segment7>Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and grief. Fear today forgot tomorrow beside the news of holy war and holy need. Our's is just a little sorrowed talk, just blown away</segment7>
		<segment8>And I won't cry for yesterday there's an ordinary world somehow I have to find. And as I try to make my way to the ordinary world I will learn to survive. Every world is my world (I will learn to survive). Any world is my world (I will learn to survive). Any world is my world, every world is our world, every world.     </segment8>
