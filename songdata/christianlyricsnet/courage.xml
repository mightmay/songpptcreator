		<segment1>I told another lie today. And I got through this day. No one saw through my games. I know the right words to say. Like &quot;I don't feel well&quot;. &quot;I ate before I came&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>Then someone tells me how good I look. and for a moment. For a moment I am happy. But when I'm alone. No one hears me cry</segment2>
		<segment3>I need you to know. I'm not through the night. Some days I'm still fighting to walk towards the light. I need you to know. That we'll be okay. Together we can make it through another day</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't know the first time I felt unbeautiful. The day I chose not to eat. What I do know is how I changed my life forever. I know I should know better. There are days when I'm okay. And for a moment. For a moment I find hope. But there are days when I'm not okay. And I need your help. So I'm letting go</segment4>
		<segment5>I need you to know. I'm not through the night. Some days I'm still fighting to walk towards the light. I need you to know. That we'll be okay. Together we can make it through another day</segment5>
		<segment6>You should know you're not on your own. These secrets are walls that keep us alone. I don't know when but what I know now. Together we'll make it through somehow. Together we'll make it through somehow</segment6>
		<segment7>I need you to know. I'm not through the night. Some days I'm still fighting to walk towards the light. I need you to know. That we'll be okay. Together we can make it through another day    </segment7>
