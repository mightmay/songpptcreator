		<segment1>[While, in my little world, I patched a plaster wall. and in my little world, I was waiting (just dying!). to take offence at something. this is all there is in my sad little world] </segment1>
		<segment2>in darkness a light shines. on you and on me </segment2>
		<segment3>I never gathered figs from a thorny branch, I never picked a grapefruit off a bramble bush. and for the past five- almost six years now!-. you know you haven't once looked at me. with kindness in your eyes. you say Judas is a brother of mine?. but sister in our darkness a light shines. and all I ever want to say for the rest of my life. is how that light is G-d, and though I've been mistaken on this or that point, that light is nevertheless G-d. </segment3>
		<segment4>every thing I thought I'd learned. ambition and illusion turned. to drawings on a loose leaf sheet. of tarts and cakes I couldn't eat </segment4>
		<segment5>what in her do I require?. the face of gratified desire. what in me does she require?. the face of a gratified desire </segment5>
		<segment6>brownish spider, brownish leaf. confirms my deepest held belief. no more spider, no more leaf, no more me, no more belief    </segment6>
