		<segment1>This is the last day of our freshmen summer. text books n' essays wait around the corner. saying goodbye now to our best friends. we'll try if we can to get home on the weekends</segment1>
		<segment2>I gotta run now. go home and take a shower. we all can meet up. at your house in half an hour. I can't get ready any faster. we better make it quarter after</segment2>
		<segment3>Runnin' through the high school hallways. this is all we've known until now. I don't ever wanna slow down. I'm packed, and I'm ready to go now. All the days we've been traveling together. I won't even look over my shoulder. 'til I find a cure for getting older</segment3>
		<segment4>Now we'll all split up and go our own ways. probably won't see each other the same ways. but no matter what happens. I'll never forget all the times we've had together    </segment4>
