		<segment1>I'm looking for peace. I'm hoping to find. Something to slow down. The hands of time. It's all slipping away.. slipping away. Moving so fast. It's out of my reach. And out of my grasp. I'm searching for Truth. I know it must be. Somewhere just around the corner from me. I've been feeling a need.. feeling a need. For something inside. A need for a change. A change in my life</segment1>
		<segment2>And it's You. ..Only You and You alone. Jesus. You found me so deep in the dark. And You called out my name. Yes, You. ..Only You and You alone. Jesus. You gave me someplace to start. To start over again. It's You</segment2>
		<segment3>I was looking for hope. In my dim lit ideals. Thinking I might stumble. Onto something that's real. But so many years.. so many years. Of being so blind. Of holding my own. Of saying I'm fine</segment3>
		<segment4>Then You gave me faith. But not of my own. And it brought both the peace and hope. Like I'd never known. You said You'd forgive.. said You'd forgive. If i would believe. That You were the son. Of a God yet unseen</segment4>
		<segment5>And it's You. ..Only You and You alone. Jesus. You gave me the faith to believe. And the mercy to see. That it's You. ..Only You and You alone. Jesus. You gave me all of my worth. By loving me first</segment5>
		<segment6>..... Only You and You alone. You found me so deep in the dark. And You called out my name. Yes You ..... only You and You alone. Jesus. You gave me some place to start. To start over again. It's You    </segment6>
