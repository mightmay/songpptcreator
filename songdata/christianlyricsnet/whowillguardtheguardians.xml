		<segment1>We are nothing, they own our lives. Just a statue of a stain in time. Spinning in circles got left behind</segment1>
		<segment2>We were all warned this would happen. But the words just rang in our ears</segment2>
		<segment3>Machines built by machines built by machines</segment3>
		<segment4>We can only hide for so long. Before they harvest us for the souls that we have left.</segment4>
		<segment5>I swear we cannot wake up from this Hell that we live in. But when the sun finally hits our face. We see that were were only reflections of reflections left by our predecessors. Dragged through the mud. (We can't wake up). Chained by the ankle. There is no more running, there is no more escaping. If only God could lay His hands down on this barren land and wake us up. Cause we are the lost, we are the helpless, we are the forgotten ones. We are the lost and we are the abandoned</segment5>
		<segment6>I swear its worth saving us. We pray for the sun to dry us up. I need a clearer head to see what we are worth. There's still life down here left to revolt. Oh I know what it looks like from there. A loss of control to this place and we're set to extinct</segment6>
		<segment7>Revolt. We stood by defeat for so long</segment7>
		<segment8>We've been under your control. We will not be a part of your disease    </segment8>
