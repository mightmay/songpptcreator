		<segment1>Verse 1: You say you never felt this way before. Its like you want to give it up but youre not sure. You feel like youre alone  all by yourself. But you wouldnt even know with Him on the shelf. Lie after lie that your brain was fed. Soon the faith in your heart wasnt in your head. Slowly you are starting to doubt it. But now you wont even allow it. Little did you know that the cross you bore. Shouted out to the world to hate you more. Watching all your friends just walk away. Made you take another look at the choice you made. I feel this is something real. Its got a little bit more than the flesh appeals to. A lot of people say things. But Ive got something to say</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You ran away cause youre afraid. You blamed it on a circumstance. You gave up faith, you played the game. You didnt even take a chance</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: No, its not religion, its a way of life. No, I dont have A.D.D. its the way I wanna be. Its your own decision, you can live or die. Let Him be your everything, be the voice of reasoning. Is the feeling controversial. I can give it to you watered down or get personal. The choice that you made was pure emotion. Now the feelings gone and you lost devotion. There will be no compromise. If He said it then believe it, open up your eyes. See the wonderful creation that Hes made in you. Theres a reason the season that he brought you through. I dont care how you react. All I really need to do is just state the fact. That the life youre living nows not reality. So get over yourself  - suck it up  and get ready</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: The battle isnt easy, but someone has to fight it. The story isnt finished and someone has to write it    </segment4>
