		<segment1>. I can reminisce about the already. I can worry and fret about the not yet. But when it all comes down I know it really. Really all comes down to the right now. So right now </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm living the next 5 minutes. Like these are my last 5 minutes. 'Cause I know the next 5 minutes. May be all I have. And after the next 5 minutes. Turn into the last 5 minutes. I'm taking the next 5 minutes. And starting all over again. Starting all over again </segment2>
		<segment3>Every moment God is giving is precious. Every heartbeat, every breath I take. We'll never have them back once they've left us. There will never be another right now. So right now</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm living the next 5 minutes. Like these are my last 5 minutes. 'Cause I know the next 5 minutes. May be all I have. And after the next 5 minutes. Turn into the last 5 minutes. I'm taking the next 5 minutes. And starting all over again. Starting all over again </segment4>
		<segment5>This is the day, this is the hour. This is the moment the Lord has made </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm living the next 5 minutes. Like these are my last 5 minutes. 'Cause I know the next 5 minutes. May be all I have. And after the next 5 minutes. Turn into the last 5 minutes. I'm taking the next 5 minutes. And starting all over again. Starting all over again.      </segment6>
