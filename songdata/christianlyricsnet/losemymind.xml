		<segment1>I've got a bad taste in my mouth. Could it be cause I trusted myself?. I got a bad feeling in my bones. Could it be cause I went it alone?. I think I'm gonna lose my mind. I think I'm gonna lose it. Is there is a light bulb between my ears. Could it be cause I had an idea?.  It haunts me in my sleep, and it comes back when I'm awake. I think I'm gonna lose my mind. I think I'm gonna lose it. I've got a bad taste in my mouth, a taste that I just can't get out. I've got a bad feeling in my bones. Could it be cause I went it alone?. I think I'm gonna lose my mind. I think I'm gonna lose it.    </segment1>
