		<segment1>Emotion, is my middle name. I lay in bed and listen to the rain. Put happy thoughts in to my head. But I find instead the hurting words you said </segment1>
		<segment2>Why won't you believe me. When I tell you the things that I see?. And I'll still see you tomorrow, at the show </segment2>
		<segment3>It's been a long winded, long time. I wish I'd never met you. I wish I could forget you. And what you said. You're directing your complaints to me. I should walk away, I could easily. Never hear a word you say </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm not your robot or your slave. I won't behave, I'm not your toy. Go on go bury me with self righteousness. I confess, I'm just a boy.     </segment4>
