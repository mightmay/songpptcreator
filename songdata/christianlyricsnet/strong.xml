		<segment1>I will follow wherever you lead me. wherever you are underneith these stars is where I wanna be. and I will lay it down, this old life of mine. I leave behind all the things of the world just to follow you</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll be strong and courageous. I'll live my life for You, my only King. 'cause You're my God through all the ages. here am I, I am Yours, send me</segment2>
		<segment3>when I fall down and I'm broken. when I strumble on the rocks and lose my way. I will cling to Your eternal love. when I'm weak You come to me, You give me strength</segment3>
