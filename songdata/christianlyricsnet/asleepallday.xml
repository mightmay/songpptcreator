		<segment1>. Tell me where our time went. And if it was time well spent. Just don't let me fall asleep. Feeling empty again</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause I fear I might break. And I fear I can't take it. Tonight I'll lay awake, feeling empty</segment2>
		<segment3>I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you. I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you</segment3>
		<segment4>Now that I'm losing hope. And there's nothing else to show. For all of the days that we spent. Carried away from home</segment4>
		<segment5>Somethings I'll never know. And I had to let them go. I'm sitting all alone, feeling empty</segment5>
		<segment6>I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you. I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you</segment6>
		<segment7>Somethings I'll never know, and I had to let them go. Somethings I'll never know, and I had to let them go. I'm sitting all alone feeling empty</segment7>
		<segment8>I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you. Feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. You're better off with out me     </segment8>
