		<segment1>it's been a long time. since I felt the rain upon my head. a moment in separation. the foreground don't seem so bright. these angels in my head. are in between the shadow and the light. were my arms too short. to ransom you from broken skin. and black and blue. unstitch your eyes. so you could read this forever. dead and broken. and I'm backwards turned to love. my heart in a box - I'd send to you. for a sky held up by stars. it's been a long time. since I felt the rain upon my head. your varying degrees of grayness. tugging the deepest of heartstrings    </segment1>
