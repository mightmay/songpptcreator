		<segment1>Pour out your fervent praise. There's a song to raise. Like a banner high. Lift up your grateful heart. To the Morning Star. He's alive and here with us</segment1>
		<segment2>Shout for joy. For the Son of God. Is the Saving One. He's the Saving One. Shout for joy. See what love has done. He has come for us. He's the Saving One</segment2>
		<segment3>We stood on sinking sand. He reached out His hand. Pulled us to His side. We turned our hearts away. He was strong to save. Now our Savior reigns in us    </segment3>
