		<segment1>My sweet Jesus, I love you. And I'm trying so hard. It's not so easy, down here anymore. Everyone just treats me, like I'm crazy or something. Sometimes I feel like I am, because no one seems to understand.</segment1>
		<segment2>But if I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you. And if I'm alive, I'm living just for you. If I sing a song, then I sing for you. I sing all day long, in everything I do.</segment2>
		<segment3>My sweet Jesus, I'm sorry, that I let you down again. It's not so easy, Down here anymore. Everyone just treats me, like I'm crazy or something. And sometimes, I feel like I am. Because no one seems to understand.</segment3>
		<segment4>But if I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you. and if I'm alive, I'm living just for you. If I sing a song, then I sing for you. I sing all day long, in everything I do.</segment4>
		<segment5>I will rejoice in this foolishness. I will rejoice in this foolishness.    </segment5>
