		<segment1>As I seek you. Let me find you. As I search for you. With all my heart</segment1>
		<segment2>As I praise you. Let me know you. Let me love your ways. And trust your heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't let my heart be hardened. Don't let my words be insincere. Fill me to overflowing</segment3>
		<segment4>As I worship. As I glorify your name. Won't you make me. A sacrifice of praise. As I bow down. As I magnify your name. Won't you make me. A sacrifice of praise. A sacrifice of praise</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't let my heart deceive me. Don't let me turn from your desires. Show me the way to freedom</segment5>
		<segment6>Make me an instrument. Of pure design. Fully obedient. Fully refined.     </segment6>
