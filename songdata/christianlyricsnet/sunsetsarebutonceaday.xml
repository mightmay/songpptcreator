		<segment1>Hello my friend. It's good to know you're looking after me. On this day I'll plummet to the sea. In my next life will you keep me warm?. Keep me warm. Listen whin I tell you, sun, the reasons are so clear. The irony is that no one is here. When you're by my side, I've got all my friends. But veracity gives me a tender glimpse. and then I'm left with nothing. Goodbye my friend. I'm glad I got to share this world with you. Our affinity is now through. In your next life can I keep you warm?. The sun sets but once a day.    </segment1>
