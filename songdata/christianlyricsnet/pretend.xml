		<segment1>I'll stay, you'll go. It's your turn but you don't know. These things will last forever. So wait, it's your time. To hide, what you deny. It should've been like this forever. I hope you change</segment1>
		<segment2>You pretend, that you're lovely. Pretend, that you'll love me. And I will always hear you out. You pretend, that you're lovely. Pretend, that you'll love me. Instead you'll let your heart grow old</segment2>
		<segment3>I've seen the way you move. You seem intelligent. You'd think I'd figure it out. Right now, I've had. Enough of all I can stand. I'm leaving this forever</segment3>
		<segment4>You pretend, that you're lovely. Pretend, that you'll love me. And I will always hear you out. You pretend, that you're lovely. Pretend, that you'll love me. Instead you'll let your heart grow old</segment4>
		<segment5>You never explain it, the way you are. And most things that happen, seem to fall apart. And when all of your troubles seem to go away. You know who to believe in, who to believe in</segment5>
		<segment6>You pretend, that you're lovely. Pretend, that you'll love me. And I will always hear you out. You pretend, that you're lovely. Pretend, that you'll love me. Instead you'll let your heart grow old    </segment6>
