		<segment1>I don't know how you can tell me. That I don't understand. I've been on those shoes before. And I made my plan. I don't want to hear those lies. I don't want to hear those cries. I don't want to live that way again. I don't want to live that way again. I found my way out;. The Savior from my sin, He takes away all the misery and pain, So you won't have to live that way again..    </segment1>
