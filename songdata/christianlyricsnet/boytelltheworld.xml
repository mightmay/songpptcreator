		<segment1>Jeremiah loved the true God. Was a good friend of mine. I never edited a single word he said. But I helped him ink his lines. And he always had me write 'em down twice, singin'</segment1>
		<segment2>Boy, tell the world. All my voice enfurls now. Boy, tell them visions that they need to see. Going to you from me</segment2>
		<segment3>If I were the king in the wall. I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd throw away those little false gods, end the war. And make peace it's up to you (Sing it now)</segment3>
		<segment4>Boy, tell the world. Ah, they're going to quarrel now. Boy, tell them issues that they need to see. Boy, it's you and me</segment4>
		<segment5>You know I'm not courageous. I'd love to have more fire. I'm no high-priced scribe or. Any paid ghost writer. My name's Baruch, the son of Neriah. The main dude it was Jeremiah</segment5>
		<segment6>Boy, tell the world. Ah, the choice is theirs now. Boy, tell them this is it, believe you me. Boy, it's true indeed</segment6>
		<segment7>Boy, tell the world. All my voice enfurls. Boy, it's you and me. Boy, tell the world. Boy, tell the world. Boy, it's true indeed. Ah, the choice is theirs now. Boy, tell them this is it, believe you me. Boy, it's true indeed    </segment7>
