		<segment1>Nothing was wrong and the future looked better than it ever looked before. So I thought. The trouble was gone;. it felt as if a bond had been restored</segment1>
		<segment2>It's over, he plead the fifth too long. Deserving to walk the plank and fall. No longer blind, the light hurts his eyes. In hope that time, will help anesthetize. Annul the hurt, the shame, that's eating him alive. He's praying more than friendship will survive. OK so far I'm not impressed, when does it get good. And how much time is left. No way, she can't end up with him. Did the hero die, don't he good guys win</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't the good guys win, don't they win. Don't they win in the end?</segment3>
		<segment4>No longer bound, it's freedom he defies. In shock cause I've been hit between the eyes. I guess it's fair;. I made the bed where I will lie. There's got to be some way now. I'm sure he'll find some way now. The pain of losing you should fade    </segment4>
