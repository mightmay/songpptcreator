		<segment1>Standing next to you, What am I supposed to do?. Time says feelings change, But to me its all the same?. I'm still here, But I'm all alone. I'm still near, But so far from home. I'm still here, But I'm all alone. I'm still near, But so far from home. Take me as I am. Please won't you hold my hand. Feelings never change, Cosequence is the same. I'm still here, But I'm all alone. I'm still near, But so far from home. I'm still here, But I'm all alone. I'm still near, But so far from home.    </segment1>
