		<segment1>People going on and on. They don't know what they got wrong. This world won't keep you satisfied. You gotta buy this. Wear this, drive that car. 'Cause that's the kind of thing. That makes you who you are. But don't keep throwing that my way</segment1>
		<segment2>No more temporary fills. I want a love that's real. Take everything I have and fill me up inside. I'm done looking for the quick fix. Jesus your love is all I'll ever need. No more temporary fills</segment2>
		<segment3>I've turned every rock and stone. Gone everywhere there was to go. But I only felt better for a while. 'Cause nothing can replace you. Erase you from my heart. And that's the kind of thing. That makes you who you are. Your the reason I can say</segment3>
		<segment4>No more temporary fills. I want a love that's real. Take everything I have and fill me up inside. I'm done looking for the quick fix. Jesus your love is all I'll ever need</segment4>
		<segment5>And nothing temporary could ever make me. Feel the way you do. 'Cause what you've given to me. I know that it will last my whole life through</segment5>
		<segment6>Woah. No more temporary fills. I want a love that's real. Take everything I have and fill me up inside. I'm done looking for the quick fix. Jesus, your love is all I'll ever need. No more temporary fills. No more. No more. No more. No more hidin'    </segment6>
