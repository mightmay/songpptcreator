		<segment1>These streets are as cold and wet. As my eyes, flesh and bones are longing home. I was taken out of context. And to think you had me not speaking for a month or two. But it's not You I know. It's just me waiting. Waiting for the sun to come out</segment1>
		<segment2>We are to follow. What if I could stand still and get moved</segment2>
		<segment3>We are to follow. We are nothing running blind. We are to follow. We are so sick of it now. We are to follow. But I'm scared to be left behind. We are to follow. Nothing now</segment3>
		<segment4>The TV dies more and more for each day. And the beauty of your eyes (in my head). Makes the flashing lights behind me on the wall look even more pale. Four o'clock and the sky is getting red. And here I am, just me waiting. Waiting for the sun to come out</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm throwing myself at you. And I'm holding on for dear life. Can I scream out of tune in this choir. God help me scream</segment5>
		<segment6>What if I would stand still and get moved. By You.     </segment6>
