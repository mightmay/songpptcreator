		<segment1>You sit beside me. And I love you. But I hate you. I don't want to feel this way. But I can't stop. You reach for my hand. But I move it. Before you can. I won't let you have the. Power once again</segment1>
		<segment2>So help me, God. To let this go. To let this go. So help me, God. (Become what I believe). To break this hold. (I'm afraid to leave). To find myself. (I just need to breathe)</segment2>
		<segment3>You think you know me. But you changed me. Into somebody. That I don't ever want to be again. I'm letting go now. Of this burden. I've been holding. I've been hurting myself now for way too long</segment3>
		<segment4>It's not too late. It's not too late. To leave it all behind. It's not too late. It's not too late    </segment4>
