		<segment1>Close my eyes, lift my hands to worship you. You're so invisible, but still so beautiful. You lift my soul up, speaking those silent words that melt my heart. You know the unexplained, healing unspoken wounds, Come be my everything, be my world. I'll step back to revere this majesty. You put me in awe with you might ways. Come take my fears and doubts away, with simply who you are.     </segment1>
