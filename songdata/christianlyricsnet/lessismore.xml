		<segment1>Jesus, I pray. Take all my mistakes. Throw them away. Destroy them for my sake</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, I call out 'cause I'm sorry. Because I fall so short of your glory. To the best of my ability. I'm practicing humility. And I lay myself before. 'Cause less is more</segment2>
		<segment3>All that I have. I lay before. With my pride on the floor. Cause to you less is more. All that I have. I lay before. With my pride on the floor. Cause to you less is more</segment3>
		<segment4>I pour out myself. All that I am. You love me so much. That you fill me again. And may these words on my heart, on my lips. Somehow mean so much more than this</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus, I pray. Know what I'm trying to say</segment5>
		<segment6>All that I have. I lay before. With my pride on the floor. 'Cause to you less is more. All that I have. I lay before. With my pride on the floor. Cause to you less is more</segment6>
		<segment7>I pour out myself, before you were Lord. I hold nothing back, 'cause to you less is more. And may these words on my heart on my lips, Somehow mean so much more than this</segment7>
		<segment8>Jesus, I pray. Just know what I'm tryin' to say</segment8>
		<segment9>Jesus, I plead. Please purify me. Make my heart clean. Drench me with your mercy. Jesus, I pray. I love you, I need you. For the rest of my days. I swear I will seek you. To the best of my ability. I'm practicing humility. And I lay myself before. 'Cause less is more.    </segment9>
