		<segment1>Went to t.o. for the weekend. Backstage passes for the show. Muddy shoes, fresh tattoos and a brand new feel- ing. That tonight will be alright we're letting go </segment1>
		<segment2>How does it feel just to know that we're out of our minds. And we don't need a reason. How does it feel to know you're alright. How does it feel just to know that we are alive. There ain't no better reason. We can make it to- night everything is alright </segment2>
		<segment3>Distant dreams, a trillion questions. And we exaggerate them all. We think the teens in magazines they have all the answers. As we build this machine to watch it fall </segment3>
		<segment4>How does it feel just to know that we're out of our minds. And we don't need a reason. How does it feel to know you're alright. How does it feel just to know that we are alive. There ain't no better reason. We can make it to- night everything is alright </segment4>
		<segment5>How does it feel to know you're alright. We can make it tonight, we can make it tonight    </segment5>
