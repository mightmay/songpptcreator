		<segment1>It's slowly maintaining now. I tried to bring it back, but it's over somehow. The static is silent so i hear you're stable now. Tired of progress but only we can work it out. It's slowly maintaining now. Tried to bring it back, but it's over somehow. The reality is you were never real at all. Spinning in circles just another programmed thought. So we'll break off a piece of nothing And take on the world baby. And i'm finally letting go and i think that you should know. And i'm finally letting go, i think its better for us both. You and me, we're gonna beat this down to the ground. But let's run for now    </segment1>
