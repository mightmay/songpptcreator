		<segment2>You are infinite worth. When weve not the words. Our hearts will sing. We are here on the earth. And somehow we re heard. When our hearts sing to You</segment2>
		<segment3>You are more than words on our lips. We are poor, with nothing to give. But, we want to bring. More than the song we sing to praise You, we praise You</segment3>
		<segment4>You are infinite worth. When weve not the words. Our hearts will sing. We are here on the earth. And somehow we re heard. When our hearts sing to You</segment4>
		<segment5>Its You we engage. Its You we embrace. When our hearts sing</segment5>
		<segment6>You are infinite worth. When weve not the words. Our hearts will sing. We are here on the earth. And somehow we re heard. When our hearts sing to You</segment6>
