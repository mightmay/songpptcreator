		<segment1>Woke up this morning. And I just had to thank God for my life. Just read through James' book. Start to pray and ask God for a wife. It's a time of devotion. As I sit and speak to my God unseen. Why should he listen? Well I love him and he's in love with me</segment1>
		<segment2>But, Why me God? Why should you choose me?. On your team God, can you use even me? </segment2>
		<segment3>I think a few years back. On a road that headed to nowhere. Now that you found me. I can see that you were always there. So great a salvation. But to you my Jesus what am I worth?. It's quiet times like this. I feel I get a glimpse of heaven right here on earth</segment3>
		<segment4>But, Why me God? why should you choose me?. On your team God, can you use even me?</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, hold me in your arms of love. Sometimes I swear I feel your heartbeat. I could never ever thank you enough. But here's my life for whatever it's worth</segment5>
