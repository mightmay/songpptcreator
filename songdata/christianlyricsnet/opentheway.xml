		<segment1>Sometimes when I wake up in the morning . And the sun shines on my face . Well I forget to open the word . And get my day started right . But Im glad that I wont forget to say my prayers . To you the glorified . The king of kings the holy one . The one who changed my life . If it wasnt for you I wouldnt have anything to live for . Thank you for life  </segment1>
		<segment2>So Lord where do we go from here . Please give me some light . Just prepare me show me Lord . Im ready to go where you lead . Im ready to go where you lead  </segment2>
		<segment3>But what if I dont know where to go . Oh Lord please come and show me . Make the way wide open . And leave no doubt in my mind  </segment3>
		<segment4>I just want to know you more . Dont stop with me . For I know I will fall if youre not holding me . And father keep me true . For I only want to be with you . Only to be with you  </segment4>
		<segment5>So Lord where do we go from here . Please give me some light . Just prepare me show me Lord . Im ready to go where you lead . Im ready to go where you lead  </segment5>
		<segment6>But what if I dont know where to go . Oh Lord please come and show me . Make the way wide open . And leave no doubt in my mind . Leave no leave no doubt in my mind . Never let me go . Increase my faith Lord increase it as we go      </segment6>
