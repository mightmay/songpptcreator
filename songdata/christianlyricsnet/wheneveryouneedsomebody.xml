		<segment1>I know that life seems hard, cruel and unkind. A lonesome journey with questions in your mind. I'll hold your weary hand as you walk down the road. Remember you're never alone</segment1>
		<segment2>Whenever you need somebody. Whenever you want someone. To reach out and touch you. With a love that is strong. Whenever you need somebody. Whenever you want a friend. To chase away the clouds. and help the sun shine again. I will be that friend</segment2>
		<segment3>If I could have one wish this I would pray. A heavenly miracle, your pain to drift away. So I'll keep on prayin' until that day comes. Remember that I'll be the one</segment3>
		<segment4>Whenever you need somebody. Whenever you want someone. To reach out and touch you. With a love that is strong. Whenever you need somebody. Whenever you want a friend. To chase away the clouds and help the sun shine again. I will be that friend</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll give you strength in times you're feeling weak. I'll give you hope and help you to believe.     </segment5>
