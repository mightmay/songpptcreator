		<segment1>every bridge that keep on burning. every leaf that you keep on turning. every road that you find uncertain. pray for you now. baby that you'll figure it out. as you keep. chasing the light</segment1>
		<segment2>remember back when you slept on my floor. blow up mattress down by the door. 10 pounds heaver from wasted time. we didn't know we were way out of line. from the moment that you popped out on the scene. hard to know what you got or your meant to be. everything that you know goes flying. from jonny o's coach to a gypsy bus island. holding hands with people in life. till they walk away saying no good byes. and you keep saying that you're running down a dream. but you don't know where it leads. as you keep chasing the light </segment2>
		<segment3>every bridge that keep on burning. every leaf that you keep on turning. every road that you find uncertain. pray for you now. baby that you'll figure it out</segment3>
		<segment4>every hope and dream thats dying. every time that i see you crying. every step that you keep on climbing. pray for you now. baby that you figure it out. as you keep. chasing the light</segment4>
		<segment5>got the call that you sent out yesterday. 40 lines and a fallout holiday. on my knees with the weight that was mine. think about you when i'm driving at night. familiar sounds and it takes me right back there. bridge street and the beat in the summer air. was it easier to watch you feet. and never deal with the hell that a young boy sees. where liquor runs thicker than blood. on your own when push comes to shove. before we had these mouths to feed. with innocent dreamsÂ… while you keep. chasing the light </segment5>
		<segment6>. every bridge that keep on burning. every leaf that you keep on turning. every road that you find uncertain. pray for you now. baby that you'll figure it out</segment6>
		<segment7>every hope and dream thats dying. every time that i see you crying. every step that you keep on climbing. pray for you now. baby that you figure it out. as you keep. chasing the light</segment7>
		<segment8>remember hearing dylan's first songs first. remember writing down a train wreck verse. we were running down franklin high school lights. burning alive in a chevrolet night. remember driving out to salton sea. dreaming bout all we thought we'd be. one way tickets into southern lights. slammed the door and said goodbye, goodbye    </segment8>
