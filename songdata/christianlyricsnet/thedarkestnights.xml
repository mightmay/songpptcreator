		<segment1>For so long i have felt alone. content to live with unrest. longing faded into countless nights. that buried my weary heart. but you brought an end. to this dead hour. and meaning to a calloused life. held in your arms. but too far from my heart. these thoughts will carry me through. the darkest nights. while your eyes rested in mine. i remember the way you looked at me. and the way you drew me close. with one deep sigh. scattering pieces of my restless mind. forgetting all that we have left behind.     </segment1>
