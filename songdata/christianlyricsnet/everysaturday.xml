		<segment1>Saturdays have never been the same. And I still can't believe your gone. So many things I wish that I could say. I guess the hardest part of moving on. Are these memories that have overtaken me. Once again i'm right here on my knee's </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm barely hanging on. With all these empty feelings. I'm hurting in so many ways. Though I can't begin. To understand the reason. I still believe that your god </segment2>
		<segment3>Saturdays have never been the same. That memory keeps epeating in my mind. The ringing phone i've called to change my world. And emptyness that words cannot define. Are these memories that have overtaken me. Once again i'm right here on my knee's </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm barely hanging on. With all these empty feelings. I'm hurting in so many ways. Though I can't begin. To understand the reason. I still believe that your god </segment4>
		<segment5>And as you cried I cried with you. I'll never leave i'll carry you through. And can't you see that I was always there. These ashes of pain will fade </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm barely hanging on. With all these empty feelings. I'm hurting in so many ways. And though I can't begin. To understand the reason. I still believe that your god </segment6>
		<segment7>I'm barely hanging on. With all these empty feelings. I'm hurting in so many ways. And though I can't begin. To understand the reason. I still believe that your god.     </segment7>
