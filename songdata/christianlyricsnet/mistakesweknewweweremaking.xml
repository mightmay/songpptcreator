		<segment1>We made plans to be unbreakable, love was all we knew. No insurance for the unthinkable, blindly get us through. We've been searching for a lifetime, short as it may seem. Riding on the fumes that spark us, while igniting dreams.</segment1>
		<segment2>Mistakes we knew we were making. Mistakes we knew we were making. Mistakes we knew we were making.</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't think about chances we're taking, mistakes we knew.. Do da na na na. Do da na na na. Driving in the rain to the hospital, quiet makes it intense, what at once seemed as the impossible, now makes perfect sense. We held hands to face the uncomfortable cold, and lonely room. Magazines and empty distractions. barely got us through.</segment3>
		<segment4>Mistakes we knew we were making. Mistakes we knew we were making. Mistakes we knew we were making.</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't think about chances we're taking, Mistakes we knew..</segment5>
		<segment6>Do da na na na. Do da na na na. And when we try to think of the life inside, we found ourselves looking at the world through our eyes. What can now be said?. Oh, little one on the other side. Dance until the band stops playing, sing with all your might.</segment6>
		<segment7>Mistakes we knew we were making. Mistakes we knew we were making. Mistakes we knew we were making.</segment7>
		<segment8>Don't think about chances we're taking, don't think about rules we were breaking. Mistakes we knew..</segment8>
		<segment9>The list goes on and on. The list goes on and on. The list goes on and on.. </segment9>
		<segment10>    </segment10>
