		<segment1>I don't mean to pry. But I'm seeing signs I can't ignore</segment1>
		<segment2>You've been holding something deep inside. And I can't keep quiet anymore</segment2>
		<segment3>Of the urgency, I'm well aware. I'll take you anywhere. If you're dissatisfied</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus:). Let's just drive. Take a deep breath and I swear. Everything will be alright. Let's just drive. Until it gets us somewhere. Even if it takes all night. Let's just drive</segment4>
		<segment5>I know you thought we were the same. We're two different kinds</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been following a narrow lane. You follow yours where it winds. Now it's time to get in gear</segment6>
		<segment7>I'll take you far from here. If you're dissatisfied</segment7>
		<segment8>(Repeat Chorus)</segment8>
		<segment9>(Bridge:). Let's just roll, away tonight. Let's just roll away until we get it right. Let's just drive</segment9>
		<segment10>(Repeat Chorus)    </segment10>
