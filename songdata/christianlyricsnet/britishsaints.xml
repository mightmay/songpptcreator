		<segment1>I say it's not my fault. As I run and hide behind the walls that I have made. To keep you out. Can you see me?. Can you hear me?. I'm crying, I'm dying, I'm trying. To find the light</segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm crawling over myself. And I'm falling. Please show me</segment2>
		<segment3>What is real, what is real. I can feel, I can feel but reality is far from what I see. I can't see, I can't see. Please heal me, yeah I'm calling. Yeah I'm calling</segment3>
		<segment4>I look into Your eyes. And quickly realize You know me all to well. Everything I'd never tell. Then You show me. That You carried. The tears, and the fears, and the years. That cripple me</segment4>
		<segment5>And I'm reaching. I want to touch You. I'm running, please show me</segment5>
		<segment6>What is real, what is real. I can feel, I can feel but reality is far from what I see. I can't see, I can't see. Please heal me, yeah I'm calling. Yeah, I'm calling</segment6>
		<segment7>Please show me</segment7>
		<segment8>And I'm crawling over myself. And I'm falling. Please show me</segment8>
		<segment9>What is real, what is real. I can feel, I can feel but reality is far from what I see. I can't see, I can't see. Please heal me, yeah I'm calling. Yeah, I'm calling.     </segment9>
