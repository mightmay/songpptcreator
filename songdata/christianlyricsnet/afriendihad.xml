		<segment1>And I have become much less. Wide eyed for your indiscretions. And I can't understand why you've chosen me. To keep those dreadful stories. Friendly</segment1>
		<segment2>And your eyes are darker when. The sun hits your brow. You were young once but you're older now. You are older now</segment2>
		<segment3>Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for. Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for</segment3>
		<segment4>Will your faith be rewarded. And will you ever see. How can I know where you are love. When you're right beside me. When you're right beside me</segment4>
		<segment5>Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for. Standing in the shadow of what you were waiting for. You are older now. You are older now. You are older now. You are older now.     </segment5>
