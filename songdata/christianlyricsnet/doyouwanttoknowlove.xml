		<segment1>Do you feel like you wake up everyday. To watch your life slide right by. Is it slipping away. Does the question call to your mind. Are you just doing time. Could there be a better way</segment1>
		<segment2>I say yes. You say maybe. But you've got to know</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). Do you want to know love tonight. Isn't it time you had true love. Would you like a little peace in your life. Well, wouldn't you. Are you gonna know love tonight. Or will you stand in the corner again. Do you want to know love tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>Did she come into your life. Did she walk into view. Just to walk out on you. Did he promise he would stay. Now he's driving away. Could any love be true</segment4>
		<segment5>I say yes. You say I doubt it. But you've got to know</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Only one love is true. That's the love God has for you. Only one love is real. In His Son it was revealed. Only one love will stay. Even when you walk away. Only one love can stand. Can you give this love a chance    </segment7>
