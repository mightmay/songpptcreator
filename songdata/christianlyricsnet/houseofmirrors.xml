		<segment1>You can't seem to see past your own reflection. Caught up in the halls of your introspection. And you're staring at your mirror on the wall. Asking, &quot;Who is the fairest of them all?&quot;. Cause, Lord, I know it's not me</segment1>
		<segment2>If only you could see. That you've already been set free</segment2>
		<segment3>Come on, come on. Let's throw our mirrors down. Come on, come on. Let's shatter the glass on the ground</segment3>
		<segment4>But you say, &quot;Hold on, if I could just try this one thing. Well, I know I can change and that would change everything.&quot;. But a house made of mirrors never helps you see any clearer. It's yourself you can't see past. And Lord isn't that just like me?</segment4>
		<segment5>If only we could see. That He's already set us free</segment5>
		<segment6>Come on, come on. Let's throw our mirrors down. Come on, come on. Let's shatter the glass on the ground. Freedom's waiting for you now. So come on, come on. Throw your mirrors down</segment6>
		<segment7>Come on if you're tired take a step outside. You might find you can forget about yourself tonight. Come on if you're tired of failed attempts to try. Freedom's waiting when you look outside</segment7>
