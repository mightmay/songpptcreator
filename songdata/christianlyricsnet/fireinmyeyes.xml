		<segment1>Feeling solid cause I've finally. Got my feet on the ground now. You rescued me with gravity. I was upside down. (down)</segment1>
		<segment2>I've got a fire in my eyes. I'm burning brighter than the sunlight. You orchestrated my escape. Now I'm awake. I feel alive for the first time. You ignite the fire in my eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>Used to live my life locked up. Inside a room with no doors. (before). You found a window, You broke it. And now I wont be contained anymore</segment3>
		<segment4>I've got a fire in my eyes. I'm burning brighter than the sunlight. You orchestrated my escape. Now I'm awake. I feel alive for the first time. You ignite the fire in my eyes</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, I know You are the reason I can breathe. Oh, I know You are the reason I am free</segment5>
		<segment6>I've got a fire in my eyes. I'm burning brighter than the sunlight. You orchestrated my escape. Now I'm awake. I feel alive for the first time. You ignite the fire in my eyes    </segment6>
