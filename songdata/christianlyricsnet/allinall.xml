		<segment1>Standing on top of the edge it feels like it's going down. Everything stays in my mind feeling in a daze on the ground. Feels like it's gonna give life's to hard to live anymore. I think I've had enough things too tough. I'm out the door</segment1>
		<segment2>All in all it's just another day now. You're falling down. What you gonna do. Standing on top of the world tonight. No ones looking back at you</segment2>
		<segment3>Stand tall. It's going on. It's going on. It's gonna be just fine. You're holding on. Holding on today</segment3>
		<segment4>Things don't stop and the others announced they're moving on. Salt &amp; tears in the minds in the mouths of a bad decision. Too late for another mistake it's bringing me down. With all your faults it isn't your fault. What's going on</segment4>
		<segment5>All in all it's just another day now. You're falling down. What you gonna do. Standing on top of the world tonight. No ones looking back at you</segment5>
		<segment6>Stand tall. It's going on. It's going on. It's gonna be just fine. You're holding on. Holding on today</segment6>
		<segment7>So you lost yourself. So you lost your way. Found life through someone else. But you threw it all away</segment7>
		<segment8>All in all it's just another day now. You're falling down. What you gonna do. Standing on top of the world tonight. No ones looking back at you</segment8>
		<segment9>Stand tall. It's going on. It's going on. It's gonna be just fine. You're holding on. Holding on today</segment9>
		<segment10>Times rolling on. Rolling on today. It's going on. Going on today    </segment10>
