		<segment1>Today, hasn't been the greatest day. Want to crawl back into bed. and sleep the day away. You came over, and dragged me out the door. Now the choir's singing and the preacher's preaching. It's all in the hands of the Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. I'll find the sunrise in the dark skies warmth in fiery trails. Drown in Your endless sea of love. So I can walk on water of hard times. Just keeping perspective</segment2>
		<segment3>My new car broke down, just the other day. They sold me a lemon. Good thing I like my lemonade. My glass was half empty. But now I see it full. It's when I'm stranded and empty handed. I become dependent on You</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
