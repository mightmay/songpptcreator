		<segment1>It's You I can't escape. Your love has me surrounded. In every way. So I surrender now. And raise my hands. All I want is You (All I want is You)</segment1>
		<segment2>You have carried me. Through many storms. And many raging seas. You rescue me. In my hour of need. And all I want is You (All I want is You)</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. I'm coming to You. For the love that I need. I'm desperate for Your touch. I'm seeking You. I'm seeking You</segment3>
		<segment4>You're always by my side. My closest friend. In You I can rely. You're with me. Every moment of my life. All I want is You (All I want is You)    </segment4>
