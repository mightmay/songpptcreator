		<segment1>There's a light inside. Inherent in all life. Divine place in our heart. Connected from the start </segment1>
		<segment2>There's a tragedy. A fear of the unknown. A fear that leads to us. Abandoning lila </segment2>
		<segment3>Glass fogged with words. Of malice and scorn. Disarming the beauty. Of spontaneity </segment3>
		<segment4>Comfort, wont translate. To happiness. This is life of all. All your life is this </segment4>
		<segment5>There's a light inside. Inherent in all life. There is a fine place in all our hearts    </segment5>
