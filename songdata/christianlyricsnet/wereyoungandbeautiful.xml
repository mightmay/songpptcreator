		<segment1>While we're young and beautiful. Kiss me like you mean it. Treat me like I 'm special. Cover me with sweetness. Cause the time will come when we're not so young and beautiful</segment1>
		<segment2>While we're young and beautiful. Livin' free and easy. Here without a worry. Dancin' in our barefeet. Cause when the summer's done. We might not be so young and beautiful</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: It's a crazy ride, baby you and I. are keepin' our sweet love alive tonight. While we're young and beautiful</segment3>
		<segment4>While we're young and beautiful. We'll party down on main street. Wearing next to nothin'. Feelin' every heartbeat. Having fun. While we're still young and beautiful</segment4>
		<segment5>(Repeat chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Beautiful, beautiful young and beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful young and beautiful</segment6>
		<segment7>(Repeat chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>.     </segment8>
