		<segment1>It's eating me away. I said to God. It's rotting in my mind. It's like a cancer. Is there anything, anything at all to numb the nothingness. I need a reason to breathe. It's eating me away</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah, yeah..</segment2>
		<segment3>It's eating me away. It nibbles at my brain. The question of my existence. And the matter of pain. I shake my fist, I shake my fist. At the cosmos and my insignificance. I need a reason to breathe. It's eating me away</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS:]. Save me from my rage. And my humanity. I'm more nothing than being. Is this my legacy. Feel it eating me away. Yeah, yeah...</segment4>
		<segment5>All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack. Come on and save me. All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack. Come on and save me</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]</segment6>
		<segment7>All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack. Come on and save me. All that I am, all that I want, all that I lack. Come on and save me</segment7>
		<segment8>It's eating me away</segment8>
		<segment9>[CHORUS]    </segment9>
