		<segment1>There is music and laughter lately. and there's prayers and praise there. are reasons to be so happy and beliefs to embrace. there are times to be so angry I'd rather lie in the sun. It's the summer of my lifetime. I've been blessed with some fun </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm a season past springtime. and my life has gone boom. keep my eyes on the Father. everything is in bloom </segment2>
		<segment3>Everything will just get better. through the seasons I'll roam. when all of the music's over. I will get to go home </segment3>
		<segment4>I don't need theology. to know that God's been good to me. He's given me a family. and a place to lay my head. Flung into the great unknown. I was walking on my own. now I'll never walk alone. if I did I would be dead. I can't use it all myself. so I take it off the shelf here it is, enjoy yourself put away your drudgery, use it up, there's always more. that's what it's intended for. be the Lord's ambassador. to be the planets remedy.     </segment4>
