		<segment1>[Verse One]. From these times now and back down to Biblical days. Counterfeit Jesus' have raised in the ages. Searched the pages of the Biblion the Holy Bible not the holy quran. No, Jesus warns us what would come after. Matthew the 24th chapter. &quot;For many will come in my name sayin' 'I am the Christ'&quot;. But they're really actors. Woe unto those who chose and teaches. A non-Biblical Jehovah Jesus. Woe, they might use the name but read in anotha' meanin'. We must put a stop to the doctrine of demons. I must run this it might get hostile. We don't want the Christ of Oneness Pentecostals. We want the incarnate Christ of the apostles. The pre-existent Son, the One of the gospel</segment1>
		<segment2>[Hook]. We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan homie. Represented through Christians is the real Jesus. We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan whoodi. Represent the authentic and real Jesus. We want the Real One, I teach the GodMan son. Represented through Christians is the real Jesus. We want the Real One, I preach the GodMan dirty. Represent the authentic and real Jesus</segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse Two]. You're bound to drown in a broken ship. If your hope is in the Jesus of Joseph Smith. Woe, that doctrine will have your life stormin'. Come to the knowledge of Christ not to the one of the Mormons. Jesus is not Lucifer's spiritual brother. And the heavenly Father did not have sex with his mother. Mary, scary I seen them two dudes in my hood. Tellin' me God was a man at first and progressed to His Godhood. No, eternal is the Godhead. The Father has always been God that's what the 90th Psalm says. Keep your eyes on Jehovah's witness. Who mistranslates 1:1 of John in the Holy Scriptures. They say more to get your mind tangled. They deny Jesus is God but the incarnate Michael the archangel. If no angel was called the Son in Hebrews 1. Then why is Jesus called the Son    </segment3>
