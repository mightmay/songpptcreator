		<segment1>It's not a family trait, it's nothing that I ate, and it didn't come from skating with Holy Rollers. It's an early warning sign, it keeps my life in line, but it's so hard to define. Nevermind..</segment1>
		<segment2>It's just a spirit thing, it's just a holy nudge, it's like a circuit judge in the brain. It's just a spirit thing, it's here to guide my heart, it's just a little hard to explain.</segment2>
		<segment3>It pushes when I quit, it smells a counterfeit, sometimes it works a bit like a teleprompter. When it's teleprompting you, i'll pray you'll let it through, and i'll help you with the how. but for now..</segment3>
		<segment4>It's just a spirit thing, it's just a holy nudge, it's like a circuit judge in the brain. It's just a spirit thing, it's here to guide my heart, it's just a little hard to explain.</segment4>
		<segment5>I took the long way, bent back down again, Some things will never. ever be explained. no they can not be explained.. yeah</segment5>
		<segment6>It's just a spirit thing, it's just a holy nudge, it's like a circuit judge in the brain. It's just a spirit thing, it's here to guide my heart, it's just a little hard to explain. (3 times)    </segment6>
