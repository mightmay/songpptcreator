		<segment1>Take one step, take one step back. And tell me, tell me you don't regret the past. Are you haunted by the record of your wrongs?. Take one breath, and breathe in deep. You never, you never tasted life so sweet. There is healing in your heartbreak. You have suffered for so long</segment1>
		<segment2>When everything inside you. Is fed up with being lied to. Take my hand and we will find the Truth. And just like all the others. You will soon discover. That after all the Truth found you. The Truth found you</segment2>
		<segment3>Take one chance, and chance it all. Creator became created for us all. Every one of us was orphaned. 'Til we heard the Father's call</segment3>
		<segment4>Unless you go. You'll never find. That truth was waiting all the time    </segment4>
