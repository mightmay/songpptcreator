		<segment1>Step back inside the lie again, you'll find you're. Wearing thin. Killing the sympathy as you take another swing. At me now. Fighting your inner self again, losing what. You feel. Shielded behind the lies that make you feel real. Now</segment1>
		<segment2>It's over and i don't feel a thing but you're. Trying to break the scar again your spirit is. Bleeding as you grin but your bridge keeps on. Burning at both ends</segment2>
		<segment3>In your mind, the ending seems to be so far from. What you need. Take back the memories as you smile to hide the. Pain from me now. Shut down the curiosity that brings you here. Again. No sense of purity as you try to take the life. From me now</segment3>
		<segment4>Nothing that you ever say could ever possibly. Erase. All the hateful things you did and now i'm. Through with you nothing you could ever say</segment4>
		<segment5>Nothing you could ever say. Hope you're happy now    </segment5>
