		<segment1>It's a big girl world now. Full of big girl things. And every day I wish I was small. I've been counting on nothing. But he keeps giving me his word. And I am tired of hearing myself speak. Do you get weary? Do you ever get weak?. How do you dream when you can't fall asleep?. I've been wondering what you're thinking. And if you liked my dress tonight. Would you still say you loved me. Under this ordinary moonlight?. I'm so afraid of what you'll say. I'd like to know if you'd be open to starting over from scratch. I'd like to know if you'd be open to giving me a second chance. I used to think I was special. And only I have proved me wrong. I thought I would change the world with a song. But I have ended up in India. With no map to guide me home. The strangest place I think I've ever been. And all this time I thought that we were friends. But my stubborn will is learning to bend     </segment1>
