		<segment1>We are, we are, we're caught in the in between. Of who we already are and who we are yet to be. And we're looking for love but finding we're still in need. It's only what we have lost will we be allowed to keep</segment1>
		<segment2>And we're waiting but our eyes are wandering. To all this earth holds dear</segment2>
		<segment3>Look at all the pretty things. That steal my heart away. I can feel I'm fading. Cause Lord I love so many things. That keep me from Your face. Come and save me</segment3>
		<segment4>We run, we run to finally be set free. But we're fighting for what we already have received</segment4>
