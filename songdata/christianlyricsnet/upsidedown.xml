		<segment1>everybody's searching for something. something that they can call their own. wishing, hoping, waiting for empty skieds to open up. but they don't. what's up with all the obsession. what's in and what's out. that's what it's about. still we dream of better. fearing nothing's gonna ever be right, yeah. all along, don't you know that you can't break free. take a look and see what's your reality. Chorus: upside down, spining round and round. happiness may not be what it seems. inside out, alone whithout a doubt. is your heart until he sets you free. from all of this reality. oh, you know the world is so crazy. it'll chew you up, spit you out. leave you feeling empty inside. filling your head with little white lies. Jesus is the only reason that my heart is free to say. you could dream a thousand dreams and have a million things. but nothing could replace the love that jesus gave. talk shows, ecstasy, horoscopes, dvd's, pop culture, magazines, chat rooms, MTV. protein diets, internet, the story isn't. over yet, the psychic network really cares?. WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?!!!!. Chorus    </segment1>
