		<segment1>I think we're going somewhere. We're on to something good here. Out of mind, out of state. Trying to keep my head on straight. I think we're going somewhere. We're on to something good here. There's only one thing left to do. Drop all I have and go with you.</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. Somewhere back there I left my worries all behind. My problems fell out of the back of my mind. We're going and I'm never knowing (never knowing) where we're going. To go back to where I was would just be wrong. I'm pressing on. Pressing on, all my distress is going, going, gone. (pressing on, pressing on). And I won't sit back, and take this anymore. 'Cause I'm done with that, I've got one foot out the door. And to go back where I was would just be wrong. I'm pressing on.</segment2>
		<segment3>I think we're going somewhere. We're on to something good here. Out of mind, out of state. Trying to keep my head on straight. I think we're going somewhere. We're on to something good here. Adversity, we get around it. Searched for joy, in you I found it.</segment3>
		<segment4>You look down on me, but you don't look down on me at all. You smile and laugh, and I feel the love you have for me. I think we're going somewhere. We're on to something good here, and we're gonna make it after all.    </segment4>
