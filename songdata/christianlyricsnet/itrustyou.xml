		<segment1>Learning again that I am not my own, crawling back to where I belong, caught in between knowing You and trusting me, come on take a ride out of the in betweens. Now I know I need You. </segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. When I can't see, I will trust You. And when I get weak, I trust You. And when I just can't let it go. I trust that You are in control. </segment2>
		<segment3>Shelter me so I can find some peace. Grabbing hold of You is letting go of me. It's easy when I remember I possess all that lays beyond my grasp. Your power commands the weight off my back. Now I know I need You. </segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS] </segment4>
		<segment5>Now I know I trust You. </segment5>
