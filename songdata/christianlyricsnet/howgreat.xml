		<segment1>I'm so bored of little gods. While standing on the edge of. something large. While standing here, so close to You. We could be consumed. What a glorious day</segment1>
		<segment2>I give up, I lay down. Rest my face upon this ground. Lift my eyes to Your sky. Rid my heart of all I hide</segment2>
		<segment3>So sweet this surrender</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: How great Your love for us. How great our love for You. That grace could cover us. How great Your love</segment4>
		<segment5>How marvelous, how brilliantly. Luminous, You shine on me. And who can fail to give You awe. To fear You, God, so sovereign and strong</segment5>
		<segment6>What a glorious day. What a wonderful day, today. What a glorious day. What a wonderful day, today. Glorious day    </segment6>
