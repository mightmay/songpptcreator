		<segment1>Caught in a whirlwind of distractions. I'm losing touch with You. So many thoughts oh they're racing through my head. They're chasing me. I've got to run faster</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm tired, so tired of falling for all their lies. I need You, please take me. Please help me out</segment2>
		<segment3>You're my escape. Take me away. I'm lettin go of myself. You're my escape. Take me away and give me wings to fly</segment3>
		<segment4>Lost in the words I can't find. As I'm reaching for time. I close me eyes oh You're leading me. But I'm fighting to stay</segment4>
		<segment5>Can You help me. Oh take me far away from this place. I need You, please help me out</segment5>
		<segment6>You're my escape. Take me away. I'm lettin go of myself. You're my escape. Take me away and give me wings to fly</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to get away. To find myself in You. So take me, away</segment7>
		<segment8>Oh won't You take me away</segment8>
		<segment9>You're my escape. Take me away. I'm lettin go of myself. You're my escape. Take me away and give me wings to fly</segment9>
		<segment10>Oh to fly, oh to fly. Until I find myself in You. Oh to fly, oh to fly. Oh to fly.     </segment10>
