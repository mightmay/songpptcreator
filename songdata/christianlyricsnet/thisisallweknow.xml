		<segment1>The understanding of your heart. Leads to the meaning of it all. To pretend I really know. Well, that would hurt so bad </segment1>
		<segment2>Tonight it feels so right. Cause this is all we know. And I will say goodbye. Cause this is all we know. And this is all we know</segment2>
		<segment3>Remember the times we used to have. Well I won't forget them. I've heard that before. Whatever it was you said. I need more    </segment3>
