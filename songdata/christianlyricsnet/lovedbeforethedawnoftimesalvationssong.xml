		<segment1>Chosen by my Maker, Hidden in my Saviour: I am His and He is mine, Cherished for eternity.</segment1>
		<segment2>When I'm stained with guilt and sin, He is there to lift me, Heal me and forgive me;. Gives me strength to stand again, Stronger than I was before.</segment2>
		<segment3>So with every breath that I am given. I will sing salvation's song;. And I'll join the chorus of creation. Giving praise to Christ alone.</segment3>
		<segment4>All the chains of Satan's curse. Lifted through His offering, Satisfied through suffering;. All the blessings He deserves. Poured on my unworthy soul.</segment4>
		<segment5>So with every breath that I am given. I will sing salvation's song;. And I'll join the chorus of creation. Giving praise to Christ alone.</segment5>
		<segment6>Singing glory, honour, wisdom, power. To the Lamb upon the throne. Hallelujah, I will lift Him high. Singing glory, honour, wisdom, power. To the Lamb upon the throne. Hallelujah I will sing with every breath that I am given. I will sing salvation's song;. And I'll join the chorus of creation. Giving praise to Christ alone.</segment6>
		<segment7>Stars will fade and mountains fall;. Christ will shine forever, Love's unfading splendour. Earth and heaven will bow in awe, Joining in salvation's song.     </segment7>
