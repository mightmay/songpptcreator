		<segment1>Verse: Dear money, i wrote a song for you. cause you lead me to believe you buy me everything i need then you, fill me full of emptiness. </segment1>
		<segment2>So money, it's time to call you out. about the way you say you pay and then you turn and walk away turns out, you can't keep your promises </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I'm changing the locks of my pockets now, cause if i don't let you in then you can't run out. well i love to hate to love you, but i cant get enough of you, i cant get enough, so I've had enough of you </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse: Hey money I've had enough you </segment4>
		<segment5>everyday its all the same the way you love to complicate, i knew that we never should've met </segment5>
		<segment6>Yea money I'm asking you to leave nothing personal but you were never worth it all, oh please don't make this harder than it is. </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus: I'm changing the locks of my pockets now, cause if i don't let you in then you can't run out. Well i love to hate to love you, but i cant get enough of you, i can't get enough, so I've had enough of you. </segment7>
