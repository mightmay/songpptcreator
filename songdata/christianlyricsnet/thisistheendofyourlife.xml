		<segment1>Hold everything dear, in your hand. In a moment it's gone, everything that you love disappears. Hold everything close, 'cause you may outlast it. Memories are all that remain of the way that it was. Watch it all go by, 'cause it's all that you can do. Everything changes so fast. For better or for worse, it was never up to you. Everything's changing so fast. Hold everything in. You're a mess. It took years to attain and a second to tear it all down. Burn everything off, 'cause the feeling won't last. Memories are all that remain of the way that it was. Watch it all go by, 'cause it's all that you can do. Everything changes so fast. For better or for worse, it was never up to you. Everything's changing so fast. It's changing now. Listen, every single second counts. Every single moment leads up to now. This is the end of their life. This is the end of your life. This is the end of our life. This is the end of my life.     </segment1>
