		<segment1>On and On.. she goes. Where she stops no one really knows. Everybody's got a problem so it seems and. She ain't afraid of tellin' me. If you can't say nothin' good, don't say nothin' at all</segment1>
		<segment2>On and On..he goes. Now look who's playin' the fool. Criticizing, telling lies, putting down. ain't you got nothin' better to do?. If you can't say nothin' good, don't say nothin' at all</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: 'Cause I know that there are times in life. When we just can't keep it to ourselves. but to want is not to make it right. We've got to tame our tongue. If you can't say nothin' good, don't say nothin' at all</segment3>
		<segment4>On and on..we go. playin the game that never ends. I think it's time that we all realize. a broken heart is hard to mend. If you can't say nothin' good don't say nothin' at all</segment4>
		<segment5>James 3:5-10</segment5>
