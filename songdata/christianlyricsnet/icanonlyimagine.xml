		<segment1>I can only imagine. What it will be like. When I walk. By Your side. I can only imagine. What my eyes will see. When Your face. Is before me. I can only imagine</segment1>
		<segment2>Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel. Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still. Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall. Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all. I can only imagine</segment2>
		<segment3>I can only imagine. When that day comes. And I find myself. Standing in the Son. I can only imagine. When all I will do. Is forever. Forever worship You. I can only imagine    </segment3>
