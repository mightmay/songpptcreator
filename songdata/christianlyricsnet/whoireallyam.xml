		<segment1>Rejected with no where to go. Disconnected from everything I've known. Forgotten, left out in the cold. Bound by the darkness around me. Just when I was losing hope</segment1>
		<segment2>Then Your love breaks through endless pursuit. In spite of what and where I've been nothing left to prove. This heart rings true when You find me. (When You find me). You remind me of who I really am</segment2>
		<segment3>A story that's rarely been told. Show me what destiny holds. Waiting the future now unfolds. (The future now unfolds). Oh yeah, now as the darkness is hiding. Hearts are flooded by Your hope</segment3>
		<segment4>Then Your love breaks through endless pursuit. In spite of what and where I've been nothing left to prove. This heart rings true when You find me. (When You find me). You remind me of who I really am</segment4>
		<segment5>And now as the darkness is hiding. Just when I was losing hope. (Just when I was losing hope). And now as the darkness is hiding. And now as the darkness runs</segment5>
		<segment6>Then Your love breaks through endless pursuit. In spite of what and where I've been, oh. When You find me. (When You find me). You remind me of who I really am    </segment6>
