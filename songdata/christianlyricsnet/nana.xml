		<segment1>you're building a case against me, prosecutor, judge and jury?. we've had this conversation in your head. because i wasn't there you made up what i said. or what i would have said? you know me so well. you've how i am and how i'm going to heaven knows. we've never had this conversation. should i be calling it a condemnation. because your not listening to me </segment1>
		<segment2>chorus: so[na na na na na]. that's all i'm gonna say. [na na na na na]. you've made up you're mind anyways. [na na na na na]. there's nothing i can do. so [na na na na na]. coulddn't we be friends if not for you </segment2>
		<segment3>i feel like the teacher from charlie brown. all you hear is that wah wah wah sound. maybe i'm a pokemon pikachu. that's what comes out when i'm talking to you. you're a crusader,you've made me your fight. your superhero name is mr. right. instead of trying to understand. you tell all your friends how wrong i am. you're not listening to me. [chorus] </segment3>
		<segment4>can't we be friends why does it. end before a word is even heard. i look at you, your attitude. why can't you see that it's not me </segment4>
		<segment5>oops, i did it again, i see. the person i'm talking about is me. assuming you're the enemy. in the crosshairs of my verbal uzi. no matter who wins,we both lose, no matter who starts,we both choose. to keep it going on, and on and on.. but lets start listening and see </segment5>
		<segment6>chorus 2: [la la la la la]. [la la la la la]. sorry that it got this way. [la la la la la]. next time i won't let it stew. [la la la la la]. couldn't we start over me and you     </segment6>
