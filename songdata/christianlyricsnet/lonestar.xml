		<segment1>My fee areplanted I can't fly. I'd like to moonwalk through the sky. I'd like to tiptoe past this atmosphere</segment1>
		<segment2>And so I gaze past satellites. Past suns and stars and endless nights. It's clear to me, I see I'm small</segment2>
		<segment3>Compared to You I'm nothing at all</segment3>
		<segment4>Beyond the depths of space and time. You built these things that remind. Setting suns and shooting stars. Say who You are</segment4>
		<segment5>You're the Lonestar. And I'll lift my head up to the sky. Your hand of greatness touches mine. I'll be content, I know I'm small</segment5>
		<segment6>Compared to You I'm nothing at all     </segment6>
