		<segment1>Desperate for changing. Starving for truth. Closer where I Started. Chasing after you </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm falling even more in love with you. Letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move. I'm hanging by a moment here with you </segment2>
		<segment3>Forgetting all I'm lacking. Completely and complete. I'll take your invitation. You take all of me </segment3>
		<segment4>Now. I'm falling even more in love with you. Letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move. I'm hanging by a moment here with you </segment4>
		<segment5>I'm livin for the only thing I know. I'm running and I'm not quite sure. Where to go. And I don't know what I'm diving into. Just hangning by a moment here with you </segment5>
		<segment6>There's nothing else to lose. Nothing else to find. There is nothing in the world that can change my mind. There is nothing else. There is nothing else. </segment6>
		<segment7>Desperate for changing. Starving for truth. Closer where I Started. Chasing after you </segment7>
		<segment8>I'm falling even more in love with you. Letting go of all I've held onto. I'm standing here until you make me move. I'm hanging by a moment here with you </segment8>
		<segment9>I'm livin for the only thing I know. I'm running and I'm not quite sure. Where to go. And I don't know what I'm diving into. Just hangning by a moment here with you </segment9>
		<segment10>Just hanging by a moment (here with you). Hanging by a moment (here with you). Hanging by a moment (here with you). Hanging by a moment here with you!    </segment10>
