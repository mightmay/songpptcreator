		<segment1>You're my hero little girl. You always save the day with your smile. You know I'm in love. With the one behind those pretty eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>chorus. I will build for all time. A house of memories. Just for you and I. There you'll find. Rooms inside. Filled with laughter, joy. And your daddy's pride. Around the table. And down the hall. We'll chase each other. Till the laughter makes us fall. In the evening. We'll lay our heads down. And thank God for these memories</segment2>
		<segment3>You're my angel. Sending messages of love. You're my future. A part of me that carries on    </segment3>
