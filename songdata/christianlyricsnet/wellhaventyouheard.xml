		<segment1>Well, haven't you heard. That the time of man is closing. Well, can't you see. That the Son of God is coming. Christ is coming. In glory coming to reign. Christ is coming. In glory coming</segment1>
		<segment2>On a white horse riding. Is He, incorruptable. He is called faithful and true. He rules in power. And wages war in righteousness. Holiness and justice and uprightness. His eyes blazing like fire. And on His head many kingly crowns. He is dressed in a robe of red. By dipped in blood. And He is called. The Word of God</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, haven't you heard. The time of man is closing. Well, can't you see. That the Son of God is coming. Christ is coming. In glory coming to reign. Christ is coming. In glory coming. We'll crown Him King of kings. And Lord of lords. Forever and ever and ever</segment3>
		<segment4>Well, haven't you heard. He's coming     </segment4>
