		<segment1>I can't believe what he's done for me. It makes me want to cry. I don't know why you put me here, but I'm sure you have your reasons. Why have you put me here?. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. I don't know what's gonna happen next, but my faith's in you. You've gotten me this far. My life is going so fast. I need to sit back and take it all in. Without god I wouldn't be here now. My dreams are turning into everyday life. Things I thought would never happen are happening all the time. All my wishes are coming true because of you. All my dreams are coming true. And I don't know what's gonna happen next.     </segment1>
