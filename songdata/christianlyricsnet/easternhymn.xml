		<segment3>Bring us love, O divine love. Bring us peace, You who are peace</segment3>
		<segment4>[Pre-Chorus]. How gracefully. You come along. How gracefully. You come</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus]. Glory, glory, glory. God is near to each one of us. Holy, holy, holy. God is near to each one of us</segment5>
		<segment6>[Bridge]. O grant us reprieve from the fighting</segment6>
		<segment7>So we just rest our. head on the shoulder of the One. In His arms we're forever. grateful for the contact. O so blessed for a moment's rest. Weeping knowing we have been touched. Weeping knowing we have been touched. O we have been touched</segment7>
