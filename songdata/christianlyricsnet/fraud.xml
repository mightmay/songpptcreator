		<segment1>You talk then you stop then you look at the mop-headed kid. Who is right by your side. He feels great as he takes all the jokes you create. And he'll steal them with all of your lines</segment1>
		<segment2>Everybody thinks he's the greatest. You know he's just a fraud. He makes you so frustrated. Can't wait till he gets caught</segment2>
		<segment3>Now he's taken all your words, Going through the motions as if he's never learned. And now he's just a mirror that you see. Without causing commotion, just stop being me</segment3>
		<segment4>You get up, take a walk, cuz you almost threw up. From the way that he hits on your girl. Find the sink, take a drink cuz there's nothing left to bring. Bro, you know that it's already brought</segment4>
		<segment5>Now he's taken all your words, Going through the motions as if he's never learned. And now he's just a mirror that you see. Without causing commotion, just stop being me</segment5>
		<segment6>You're the scum and I'm the mountain water. Rolling through the fields where you're not invited. Go your own way now before it's too late. Just stop being me</segment6>
		<segment7>Everybody thinks you're the lamest. We all know you're a fraud. Life can be so frustrating. I'm so glad you got caught</segment7>
		<segment8>Now he's taken all your words, Going through the motions as if he's never learned. And now he's just a mirror that you see. Without causing commotion, just stop being me</segment8>
		<segment9>[Repeat in background:] (Just stop being me). You're the scum and I'm the mountain water. Rolling through the fields where you're not invited. Go your own way now before it's too late. Just stop being me    </segment9>
