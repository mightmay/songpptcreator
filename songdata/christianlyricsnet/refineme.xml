		<segment1>I come into this place. Burning to receive your peace. I come with my own chains. From wars I've fought for my own selfish gain. You're my God and my Father. I've accepted your Son. But my soul feels so empty now. What have I become? </segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, come with your fire, Burn my desires; refine me. Lord, my will has deceived me. Please come and free me. Refine me</segment2>
		<segment3>My heart can't see. When I only look at me. My soul can't hear. When I only think of my own fears. They are gone in a moment. You're forever the same. Why did I look away from You. How can I speak Your name? </segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, come with Your fire, burn my desires; refine me. Lord, my will has deceived me. Please come and free me. Come rescue this child. For I long to be reconciled to You</segment4>
		<segment5>It's all I can do. To give my heart and soul to You. And pray, and pray, oh I will pray</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord, come with Your fire, burn my desires; refine me. Lord, my will has deceived me. Please come and free me. Come rescue this child. For I long to be reconciled to You</segment6>
		<segment7>Refine me, refine me. Refine me, refine me</segment7>
		<segment8>.     </segment8>
