		<segment1>You walk into a room, it's cold as hell. Your feet ache and your head, it swells. Your love, you can't buy it or sell it. Your love changes everything </segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, could you stay, my love?. Oh, could you wait, my love?. Thirty days go by before you realize what you had. You turn around then you're upside down before you even know. Your love is like a word I don't understand. You say, your love, it changed the world, could I understand?. When you say, you say.. </segment2>
		<segment3>You'll get up again. Could we get out again?. You'll get up again for good, my love </segment3>
		<segment4>You say, you say..     </segment4>
