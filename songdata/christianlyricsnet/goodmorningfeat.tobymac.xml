Wave away my yesterday. 'Cause I'm leaving it behind me.. Hello sunshine, come what may.. I feel something new inside me.. I hear the birds singing. Now my alarms ringing. Get up, get up. Hey!</segment1>
		<segment2>It's a good morning!. Wake up to a brand new day. This Morning,. I'm stepping, stepping on my way. Good Morning,. You give me strength,. You give me just what I need. And I can feel the hope that's rising in me.. It's a good morning</segment2>
		<segment3>Slow down, breathe in,. Don't move ahead. I'm just living in this moment. I've got my arms raised, un-phased. Jump out of bed. Gotta get this party going. I went to bed dreaming,. You woke me up singing. Get up, get up, hey</segment3>
		<segment4>It's a good morning!. Wake up to a brand new day. This Morning,. I'm stepping, stepping on my way. Good Morning,. You give me strength,. You give me just what I need. And I can feel the hope that's rising up in me.. It's a good morning</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I'm smiling, and I'm kissing all my worries good-bye. Got the feeling, if I spread my wings I might even fly. You are my truth, my way. Give me the strength to say. Get up, get up, get up. Cause it's a good morning</segment5>
		<segment6>Mr. Mac to the mic. [Toby Mac:]. Hey, top of the morning to you 'disa. You smoothie, me ice cold pizza. Cafe au lait, latte dah. You do the zumba, but I do not. Give me like half a marathon,. I'll give you the gospel of St. John.. Hits me like a wake-up bomb. Cause' we both know that his mercy flows,. In the morning.</segment6>
		<segment7>Wake up to a brand new day. This Morning,. I'm stepping, stepping on my way. Good Morning,. You give me strength,. You give me just what I need. I can feel the hope that's rising up in me.. It's a good morning. Wake up to a brand new day. This Morning,. I'm stepping, stepping on my way. Good Morning,. You give me strength you give me just what I need. I can feel the hope that's rising up in me.. It's a good morning</segment7>
		<segment8>[Toby Mac:]. Top of the morning to you 'disa. Hey, Top of the morning to you girl. To-to-top of the morning to you 'disa. Morning little Miss Sunshine.. [Spoken:]. Man, you morning people.. No, I'm serious.
