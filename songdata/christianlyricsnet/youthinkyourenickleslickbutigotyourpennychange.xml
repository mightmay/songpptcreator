		<segment1>I'd take it back to have the chance to see her laugh, to see her dance. You never told me it would be so hard. And now I wait for everyday to go away, just go away.</segment1>
		<segment2>Goodnight, goodnight. I would tuck you in so tight, but I'm just. a tired man with these tired hands of mine. Wake up, baby. It's time for us to leave. You're just a little girl in your lonely world with me.</segment2>
		<segment3>So let's go all the way. Let's go all the way. This dark road will lead right where you want to be. You're driving, so take the wheel.</segment3>
		<segment4>Your conscience is pleading as you start believing. that what you're doing is not for you. But there's no mistaking the life that you're taking, so kill the inconvenient truth.</segment4>
		<segment5>So let's go all the way. Let's go all the way. This dark road will lead right where you want to be. You're driving, so take the wheel.    </segment5>
