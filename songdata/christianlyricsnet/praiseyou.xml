		<segment1>Lord I really don't know how to write a song, I'm not always eloquent. sometimes I get it wrong, But the thing your doing in me I can't describe. What a fool I'd be if I chose to hide, this transformation,new motivation. Thought that we were close I've known you all this time, but I was just living my life my way just getting by, Thought that if i do a good deed or two, that was enough to please you, I kept the parts I wanted to, and missed out on the real you. </segment1>
