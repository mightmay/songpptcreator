		<segment1>Pushing my way through these crowded streets. Trying not to be swept away. Fighting just to keep this crowd from. Hiding You another day</segment1>
		<segment2>So maybe this time I'll find You. And maybe this time I'll push through. To see You today, today</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. Won't You take me away. Won't You take me away. 'Cause I need some time to get away. Where only You could ever. Take me away, away, away. Too many days I've been distracted. Watched these crowds push You away. I'm so tired of feeling empty. Without You I waste these days</segment3>
		<segment4>So maybe this time I'll find You. Just don't stop calling me to You. And I'll find my way today    </segment4>
