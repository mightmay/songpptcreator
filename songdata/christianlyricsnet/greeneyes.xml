		<segment1>You've got the biggest green eyes they've ever seen. And in that red dress. There's no contest. You're the prettiest one around. And you reach down in your purse to check your phone. And already there's five guys trying to light it. When they realize</segment1>
		<segment2>That everybody wants to know your name. And they're just thinking of the perfect words to break the ice. But every time it's just in vain. Cause you're not impressed. But you're so polite</segment2>
		<segment3>I know I'm not the sharpest knife you've ever seen. I don't have the clothes. I don't have the hair. I know whats going on and I'm self aware. And for some weird reason. That meens more to you. Than what any two bit scene kid could say to you</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause everybody wants to know your name. And they're just thinking of the perfect words to break the ice. But every time it's just in vain. Cause you're not impressed. But you're so polite</segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
