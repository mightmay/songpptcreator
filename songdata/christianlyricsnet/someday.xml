		<segment1>Ready or not the years are blurring. Running away the mind is turning. Skip to the end to find the meaning. Theoughts are fading, yet I wonder still. Like it or not your eyes are open. Playing around, the circles going. Face of a child, your mind is old. The clock ran down before I could begin</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I wish we all could win. I wish we all could smile. I wish we all could make our mothers proud</segment2>
		<segment3>Want it or not you ocan't just leave it. Throw it away, I can't believe it. Walking for days, I know you'll see that. Times are changing, soon we'll be the same</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Someday, Someday, Someday. You'll come around. Someday, Someday, Someday. Your time will come. There's nothing more that I can do. I know we all can make throught. I hope that someday you will see</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Someday, Someday, Someday. You'll come around. Someday, Someday, Someday. Your time will come. There's nothing more that I can do. I know we all can make throught. I hope that someday you will see    </segment7>
