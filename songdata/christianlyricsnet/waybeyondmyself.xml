		<segment1>I've been thinking it's about time. To win the war that fights against all the lies invading my mind. You have brought me to my senses. Even though You built this world to shake. You still love me in a personal way. So I think it's time to leave my doubt behind</segment1>
		<segment2>There's so much more than meets the eye. Or what's going on inside. I believe in something way beyond myself. Like the wind that moves the leaves. Lord, You move me to my knees. I believe in something way beyond myself</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh the way we build our empires hoping to impress our friends. We've forgotten how to inspire those who fall to rise again. Oh my God, You've built this world to shake. You still love me in a personal way</segment3>
		<segment4>So I think it's time to leave my doubt behind</segment4>
		<segment5>Storms are gonna come my way, I know. Some things are out of our control but there's a hope beyond myself. It's You and You will never let me go. Now I want my life to show You got me thinking beyond myself. Way beyond myself</segment5>
		<segment6>There's so much more than meets the eye. Or what's going on inside. I believe in something way beyond myself. Like the wind that moves the leaves. Lord, You move me to my knees. I believe in something way beyond myself    </segment6>
