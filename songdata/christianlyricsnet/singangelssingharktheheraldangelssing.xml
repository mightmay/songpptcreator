		<segment1>A long, long time ago. In the land of Bethlehem, I'm told. Angel Gabriel came to earth to tell. Heaven waited for the birth. And a hush had filled the earth. And in between the two. Love came crashing through</segment1>
		<segment2>Sing, angels, sing. Good news you bring. Until all earth and heaven ring. Lift up your voice. A baby boy is born to make us free. Sing, angels, sing. Sing, angels, sing. Sing, angels, sing</segment2>
		<segment3>All was quiet and still. For the poor men on the hill. And though they had no gold. They'd be given wealth untold. Shepherd's worshipping. As a million angels' voices sing. And on a bridge of praise. Heaven and earth unite that day</segment3>
		<segment4>Sing, angels, sing. Good news you bring. Until all earth and heaven ring. Lift up your voice. A baby boy is born to make us free. Sing, angels, sing. Sing, angels, sing. Sing, angels, sing</segment4>
		<segment5>Hark, the herald angels sing. Glory to the newborn King. Peace on earth and mercy mild. God and sinners reconciled. Joyful all ye nations rise. Join the triumph of the skies. With angelic host proclaim. Christ is born in Bethlehem. Hark, the herald angels sing. Glory to the newborn King</segment5>
		<segment6>Sing, angels, sing. Good news you bring. Until all earth and heaven ring. Lift up your voice. A baby boy is born to make us free. Sing, angels, sing. Sing, angels, sing. Sing, angels, sing    </segment6>
