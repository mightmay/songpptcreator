		<segment1>'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus. Just to take Him at His Word. Just to rest upon His promise. And to know &quot;thus saith the Lord&quot;. You're the shelter in the storm. You're the dearest friend I know. Oh, Light of the world, carry me home. Oh, for grace to trust Him more. Jesus, Jesus how I trust Him. How I proved Him o'er and o'er. Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus. Oh, for grace to trust Him more. Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus. Just from sin and self to cease. Just from Jesus simply taking. Life and rest and joy and peace. Give me strength to trust You more    </segment1>
