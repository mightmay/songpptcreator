		<segment1>Can we get back to the basics?. Back where we came from?. When we didn't have no worries. We were basking in the sun. Sometimes the least of my problems feel like the biggest ones. When you said that you were leaving, felt like we had just begun. It would be so easy. Oh, if it was that easy. I can't sleep tonight. So tell me one more time. When I dream, it will be you that's on my mind. It's my heart you hold, so never let it go. I still love you like I loved you long ago. Saw you out on the freeway, and later at the show. It could be my imagination, but I know I'm not alone. All the lights in the city are burning out with time. But there's a light that hangs above, and it's keeping us in line. All this time that's running by won't stop until we stand still. 'Cause we are incomplete until we finally breathe. Let's take a look at the future. See where we left off. I'm so grateful that I found you. Cause, without you, I am lost    </segment1>
