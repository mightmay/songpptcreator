		<segment1>don't try to hide. the mistakes i made this time. but please try and listen. cus i'm breaking my heart tonight. so you can see whats inside. cus wherever you go, well that's where i'll go. i'd do so much i'll show but you won't know. so heres a song to show for the things ive blown. but im sorry so.. thats the only way that i know</segment1>
		<segment2>and all ive learned is. what we hate we make, what we hate we make. theres no time for hating but what we hate we make</segment2>
		<segment3>something is about to change. i can feel it in my heart today. and you know its not the first time. but i bet it won't be the same. cus right now im at an all time low. so heres a song just so you won't go. cus that the only thing that i know</segment3>
		<segment4>and i will start with a verse. then a bridge, write a chorus. so we all can sing along. with everythign we got. but between you and me this song would be. written for us but i know thats not enough. to say im sorry</segment4>
