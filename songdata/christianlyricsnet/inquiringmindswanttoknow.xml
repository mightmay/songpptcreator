		<segment1>How you fell depends on what you think about. What you need depends on what you can't live without. How you act goes right back to the way you feel. What you see isn't always what is real. So where do we go? and what do we do?. You're asking me and I'm asking you. To be real with yourself and don't play the game. Of daily life, it's all the same. The way you think depends on what you're going thru. What you create comes from deep inside of you. What you know makes the difference in what you hate. What you love depends on how you relate. Inquiring minds want to know.    </segment1>
