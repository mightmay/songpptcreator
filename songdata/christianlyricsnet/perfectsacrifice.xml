		<segment1>Life could take, take every dream away. Youd still be my Risen One, the place where my hope comes from. Life could break, Youd still be my saving grace. My promise of all to come, the place where my hope comes from </segment1>
		<segment2>Ive been chosen by Your hand. Through forgiveness called Your friend. Now Youre here with me. Loosed my chains and took my shame, on the Cross You bore my pain - Jesus died for me </segment2>
		<segment3>Its a gift we dont deserve. And a treasure we cannot earn. You paid the price. Now a life that offers more. And a Cross that said it all - A perfect sacri&amp;#64257;ce </segment3>
		<segment4>All my hope is in You. My treasure and my truth. My hope is in You    </segment4>
