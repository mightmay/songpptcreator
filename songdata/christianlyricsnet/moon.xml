Oh she cries. But she still shines. Though the night falls around her. And by her light. I find my way. When I fear the path laid before me. I look to the light of her face. And thank her for being so brave. The moon remains. In fullness or frailty. A faithful climb. And I stand amazed at the way     </segment1>
