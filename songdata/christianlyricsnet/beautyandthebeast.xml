		<segment1>Tale as old as time. True as it can be. Barely even friends. Then somebody bends. Unexpectedly</segment1>
		<segment2>Just a little change (oh, oh). Small, to say the least. Both a little scared. Neither one prepared. Beauty and the Beast</segment2>
		<segment3>Ever just the same (In your eyes, am I beautiful?). Ever a surprise (Love like this is a miracle). Ever as before. Ever just as sure. As the sun will rise</segment3>
		<segment4>Tale as old as time. Tune as old as song. Bittersweet and strange. Finding you can change. Learning you were wrong</segment4>
		<segment5>Certain as the sun (oh, oh). Rising in the east. Tale as old as time. Song as old as rhyme. Beauty and the Beast </segment5>
		<segment6>Ever just the same (In your eyes, am I beautiful?). Ever a surprise (Love like this is a miracle). Ever as before. Ever just as sure. As the sun will rise</segment6>
		<segment7>Certain as the sun (oh, oh). Rising in the east. Tale as old as time. Song as old as rhyme. Beauty and the Beast.     </segment7>
