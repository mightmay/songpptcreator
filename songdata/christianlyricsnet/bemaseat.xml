		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on Romans 14:10, 1 Corinthians 3:12-15</segment1>
		<segment2/>
		<segment3>When our labors all retire. There will be a trial by fire. Will your treasure pass the test. Or will it burn up with the rest. You may build upon a sure foundation. With your building in dilapidation. When it all comes down to rubble. Will it be wood, hay, or stubble. Or precious stones, gold and silver-. Are you really sure? </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). And we all will stand at the Bema Seat. All will be revealed - it will be complete. Will there be reward in the fiery heat. When we see our lives at the Bema Seat </segment4>
		<segment5>Every talent will be surely counted. Every word will have to be accounted. Not a story will be left untold. We will stand and watch the truth unfold. Every score - will be evened - nothing to defend </segment5>
		<segment6>Every building will be shaken. Every motive will be tried. He'll give reward to the faithful. Will you receive or be denied?    </segment6>
