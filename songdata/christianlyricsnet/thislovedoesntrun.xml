		<segment1>Here I am, where I stand. I never wanted to be again. I gave too much to what I shouldn't have. You took from me what little I had left. You hurt my soul fast. Is there a place where I can rest. Where I can finally stay and be safe</segment1>
		<segment2>Where I know that I belong. In hands that heal me. And I know I'm finally home. In arms that won't let go. Its the love that I need. It's the love that only you can bring. And I'll never be alone. Cause this love doesn't run. No this love doesn't run</segment2>
		<segment3>What I lost and what is gone. Where I've been. It doesn't matter now. Cause I let go of holding on. To anything that's not Your love. Cause Your the only one I can live for. And I know that I'll never have to be afraid. Of losing what I gave. Cause You keep me safe</segment3>
		<segment4>. Where I know that I belong. In hands that heal me. And I know I'm finally home. In arms that won't let go. Its the love that I need. It's the love that only you can bring. And I'll never be alone. Cause this love doesn't run. No this love doesn't run</segment4>
		<segment5>I never knew that leaving you forever. I never heard the voice inside the storm. You hold my heart. You hold the world together. Only You can hold me now</segment5>
		<segment6>Where I know that I belong. In hands that heal me. And I know I'm finally home. In arms that won't let go. Its the love that I need. It's the love that only you can bring. And I'll never be alone. Cause this love doesn't run. No this love doesn't run.     </segment6>
