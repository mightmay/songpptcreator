		<segment1>i remember the time those feelings ran right through my mind scared to find out what's in store we were only kids we were so innocent this is what we were living for fall into my arms and let all fade away fall into my arms to my heart this is what we're living for fall into my arms fall and let it fade you can always you can always count on me no more looking back it's do or die how do i know how do i know you're the one for me when i see you i see oceans of deep blue i see a heart that's built for me and you it's a crazy cycle we choose to spend our whole life loving &quot;you&quot; we share our lives together and watch eachother die i never knew it would get as intense as this 6 years seems like yesterday we were only kids we were so innocent it's a crazy cycle we chose to spend our whole lives loving &quot;you&quot; to spend our whole lives loving &quot;you&quot; and watch eachother die.     </segment1>
