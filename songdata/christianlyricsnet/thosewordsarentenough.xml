		<segment1>Feelings, inside my head. I don't know, but I'm thinking about you. Understand that it's so hard to tell you, cause you already know. You already know. When it's twice as hard to realize. That I'm still trying twice as hard to satisfy myself on my own</segment1>
		<segment2>and I'm still waiting for things to change. I lay my life before you, and I'm not getting up. father, how I adore you. those words are not enough. father, know I love you, and know I am wrong. Lord, please take my life. Make me your son. Make me your son    </segment2>
