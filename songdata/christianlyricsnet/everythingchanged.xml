		<segment1>I guess that it was bound to happen. Was just a matter of time. Now I've come to my decision. And it's a one of the painful kind. 'Cause now it seems that you wanted a martyr. Just a regular guy wouldn't do. But baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you. You really gotta hand it to ya. 'Cause girl you really tried. But for every time that we spent laughin'. There were two times that I cried. And you were tryin' to make me your martyr. And that's the one thing I just couldn't do. 'Cause baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you. 'Cause tables are meant for turnin'. And people are bound to change. And bridges are meant for burnin'. When the people and memories. They join aren't the same. Still I hope that you can find another. Who can take what I could not. He'll have to be a super guy. Or maybe a super god. 'Cause I never was much of a martyr before. And I ain't 'bout to start nothin' new. And baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you. 'Cause tables are meant for turnin'. And people are bound to change. And bridges are meant for burnin'. When the people and memories. They join aren't the same. But I hope that you can find another. Who can take what I could not. He'll have to be a super guy. Or maybe a super god. 'Cause I never was much of a martyr before. And I ain't 'bout to start nothin' new. And baby, I can't hang upon no lover's cross for you    </segment1>
