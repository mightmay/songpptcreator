		<segment1>When all Thy mercies, O my God, My rising soul surveys, Transported with the view I'm lost. In wonder, love, and praise.</segment1>
		<segment2>Unnumbered comforts to my soul. Thy tender care bestowed. Before my infant heart could know. From whom those comforts flowed</segment2>
		<segment3>When worn with sickness, oft hast Thou, With health renewed my face, And when in sins and sorrows bowed, Revived my soul with grace.</segment3>
		<segment4>Through every period of my life. Thy goodness I'll pursue, And after death, in distant worlds, The glorious theme renew.    </segment4>
