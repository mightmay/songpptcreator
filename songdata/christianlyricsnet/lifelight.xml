		<segment1>The A.M. dawns again. And Im seeking the Source. Searching the force, longing for warmth. That Ive never ever felt before. Cuz I cannot find more of life. In this crazy world that seems to leave me dry. Its only with You. That I find my way through</segment1>
		<segment2>Another breath to breathe. In this heat of the day. Im finding a way, but feeling the strain. Theres a pressure in the air that preys. But there is a light in this life. And its You, the star, that guides when Im lost at night. So light up the sky. A ray of life to every eye</segment2>
		<segment3>Whenever your light shines. I can always find. Something more of life. Whenever You break through. Take me somewhere new. Deeper into you.     </segment3>
