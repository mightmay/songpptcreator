		<segment1>Dreaming in a nightmare, a dream you beg of me to lay you down to sleep. And your reality is lifeless when you wake to me. Leave it alone, take your hands off of my body. Cause no one can save you from you. So I wake you from this nightmare, a fairytale of me to break you from this dream. And your reality is lifeless, when you wake to me. One day these arms will comfort no more. One night I leave sparkles in your eyes. And you'll leave this crush and dream of me no more    </segment1>
