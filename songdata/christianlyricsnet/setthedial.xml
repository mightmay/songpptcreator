		<segment1>Static fights. Against the reel. Real is all i want to feel. This feeling's got me off the ground. Transmitting love around. When everything's a little out of place. Make your move to escape. Set the dial and make it straight. A frequency we will create. So play a song of love. The song we want to hear</segment1>
		<segment2>We are the radio. Onto the world that's lost control. Let's turn it up so they all know the song that's playing. On the radio</segment2>
		<segment3>Love is a movement but our movements slow. The reception on our radio. Is breaking in and out of flow. The sound it can not be concealed. Concealed is how we seem to feel. Let's break these airwaves push it through. Free the signal make a move. So play a song of love. The song we want to hear</segment3>
		<segment4>We are the radio. On to the world that's lost control. Let's turn it up so they all know the song that's playing. On the radio</segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah take control. To the tune of what we know. Let sound waves show</segment5>
		<segment6>Were letting go. At the top of my lungs. I'm gonna tell everyone. This is the sound. That sole surrounds. So turn it up. I'm gonna dare to share. Open my mouth and declare. This is the sound. So play it loud. Into the airwaves now. At the top of my lungs. I'm gonna tell everyone. This is the sound. That sole surrounds. So turn it up    </segment6>
