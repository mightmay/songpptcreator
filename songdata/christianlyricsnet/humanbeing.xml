		<segment1>See genetics singing out. The face of this race. The work of creation shouting out. Do you see the same or do you see. What's unique</segment1>
		<segment2>With the Flesh, the Blood, the Bones, Here come the clones. With all their garbage, with all their splendor. The breath of the spirit. We can never render</segment2>
		<segment3>No blade identical, no heart impermeable. How can you manufacture the holy spirit. Father bring life to Blood, to Bones, Here come the clones</segment3>
		<segment4>With all their garbage, with all their splendor. The breath of the spirit we can never render</segment4>
		<segment5>The Bodies are inhabited with life, The son of man. The power in no hierarchy forthcoming. Even the bereft of life will stand</segment5>
		<segment6>As the trumpet drones raise the bones. Prophesy to light, no man can elevate alone</segment6>
		<segment7>We're not so different, we're not the same. Hating brother's quality and beauty. Who are we?</segment7>
		<segment8>Human being's the name. With flesh, with moans. We throw the stones. At all the garbage, and all the splendor. At the spirit and hope that it can render</segment8>
		<segment9>We fall.     </segment9>
