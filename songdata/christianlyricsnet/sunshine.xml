		<segment1>Red are the rosiest cheeks i have seen. orange is the sunset that lulls you to sleep. yellow the birds that have folded their wings for the night. You are the sunshine. On rainy days. And if i have sunshine. A rainbow is coming my way. Green are the meadows you see in your dreams. Blue are the stars in the sky dark and deep. Purple the evening thats tucking you in for the night. You are the sunnshine. On rainy days. And if i have sunshine. A rainbow is coming my way. Cloudy days. Will Blow away. Ominis sky will not always be grey. Cloudy days. Will blow away. Ominis Sky will not always be grey. You are the sunshine. On rainy days. And if i have sunshine. A rainbow is coming my way. (Sunshine). On rainy days. And if i have sunshine. A rainbow is coming my way. If i have sunshine a rainbow is coming my way.    </segment1>
