		<segment1>Lazy day. Just room enough for me to think and pray about each new day. Draw me from my drowning apathetic state </segment1>
		<segment2>Stormy day. Just watch the rain melt all my doubt away. Fire away the heated arrows to my lukewarm state </segment2>
		<segment3>Don't wait. Don't wish away. Today is going to be the day He made. Don't waste. One day is all that we've got to give and take </segment3>
		<segment4>Bend and break my mind and heart to feel the urgent need. To take all I see and pour my life into eternity. And take it all today and give everything. And take it all today. Lazy day. You're in everything that comes my way.     </segment4>
