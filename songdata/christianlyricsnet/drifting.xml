		<segment1>I am drifting here, alone and incomplete. Searching for the other part of me, for my missing peace. All the ways i&quot;ve known, the paths I used to seek, every one of them seems empty now. No more within my reach. Now there's something, I feel something. Yes there's something stirring..Just beneath the surface, of all I thought I knew lies the naked truth, of who I am and what I'm coming to. As I grope within this suffocating silence, I feel you calling me to you now. I hear your voice and then; I feel there's something, now there's something, yes there's something stirring.. When I look into your eyes, I see myself within. Can I reach beyond this empty life?. When I look into your eyes, the darkness seems to fade. What' s past is gone, I finally see the truth.    </segment1>
