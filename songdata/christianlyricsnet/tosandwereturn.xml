		<segment1>Cowering man, a legion of no-ones call, bet it all</segment1>
		<segment2>Covenant kill, he points to the heavens, bare. with blank stares</segment2>
		<segment3>Beckoning search in self for his answer. Reckoning, purge, the great fall, the cancer. Settlement comes in wages now he is</segment3>
		<segment4>shattered, broke, and all alone</segment4>
		<segment5>Weve lost all our control. Our faces fall to the ground. Were powerless to your voice. Surrender to the sound.</segment5>
		<segment6>Whatll it take to prove our decisions wrong. will we fall?</segment6>
		<segment7>Alone in ourselves there nothing but chaos, fear. end it here</segment7>
		<segment8>til we concede to drink from the endless. The desert we find ourselves in is hopeless. til we submit and let go the contol</segment8>
		<segment9>we will always be alone..</segment9>
		<segment10>Weve lost all our control. Our faces fall to the ground. Were powerless to your voice. And No longer seeming so, shattered, broke and all alone</segment10>
		<segment11>Who do I belong To?. Not Earth. Not world. Not Evil. Not mortals. Not wretches. Not horrors</segment11>
		<segment12>Who do I belong to?. Unchanging. Unbreaking. Unfailing. Creator. Immortal. Eternal</segment12>
		<segment13>Surrender to the sound.    </segment13>
