		<segment1>Black rose where are you now. White skin as cold as the snow we walked in. Your lips like midnight. That night we walked for hours. And I remember. But maybe I'm the only one who still remembers</segment1>
		<segment2>You slipped away. Why would you come back to say. You've already moved on. You slipped away. But I've come back to say that you're not really gone</segment2>
		<segment3>My black rose where are you now. And yes I've seen your black rose petal fall. Fall down to the ground like glass shatters. And turning into ashes. But I've seen your color and it's like a blood drop. And maybe I'm the only one. Who still remembers</segment3>
		<segment4>You've slipped away. But why would you come back to say. You've already moved on. You slipped away. But I've come back to say that you're not really gone</segment4>
		<segment5>So try to disappear. But my mind doesn't slip that easy. You can try to disappear. But my dear you're still standing here</segment5>
		<segment6>You've slipped away. But why would you come back to say. You've already moved on. You slipped away. But I've come back to say that you're not really gone    </segment6>
