		<segment1>When I See You Lyrics. Day of Fire</segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse 1:]. I'm broken but I care for you, tried to change all that you wanted me to. Was to late and just not enough, to relate to that kind of love. Taken so long to see it..</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. I'm righting all my wrongs still your gone wonderin when I'll see you again. Missed the times you call to tell me of all the love that you had for me back then.</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 2:]. For the time I should have cared for you, and all the pain that I was putting you through. Late nights sitting by the phone, a life of leaving you alone. Taken so long to see it, waited so long to be it..</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus 2:]. I'm righting all my wrongs still your gone wonderin when I'll see you again. Missed the times you call to tell me of all the love that you had for me back then. Whether it's all year long, or tomorrow when it comes, it's all in good time. When I see you, when I see you again</segment5>
		<segment6>[Bridge:]. It's all in good time when I see you    </segment6>
