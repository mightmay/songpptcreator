		<segment1>I can see it your eyes you're hurting. But pain is part of learning who you are. All these truths can sometimes be deceiving. When your whole world comes crashing to the ground</segment1>
		<segment2>Tell me everything you need now anything at all. And I will be the one who's waiting anytime you fall</segment2>
		<segment3>Yeah, When you come undone. When you come undone</segment3>
		<segment4>You know I can't be like everybody. Cause I can't tell you what you want to hear. I don't know if I can make it better. All I know is I will be around</segment4>
		<segment5>Tell me everything you need now anything at all. And I will be the one who's waiting anytime you fall</segment5>
		<segment6>Yeah, When you come undone. When you come undone</segment6>
		<segment7>When all your plans are made out lying on the floor. And all your dreams are turning into nothing more. When all your hope has left you know you're not alone. Just hold on. Hold on</segment7>
		<segment8>Tell me everything you need now anything at all. And I will be the one who's waiting anytime you fall</segment8>
		<segment9>Yeah, When you come undone. When you come undone.     </segment9>
