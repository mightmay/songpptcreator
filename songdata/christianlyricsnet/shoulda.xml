		<segment1>Ohhh.. yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>I should have stopped, looked and listened before I proceeded. But caution I threw to the wind. Many've been placed in my life to help lead me and guide me. But I didn't want to talk to them. So I ignored their advice and I tried to disguise pain from you and all the things you did. The wrong road was chosen my heart has been broken. Cause I didn't want to hear them</segment2>
		<segment3>Shoulda' said what I didn't say. Shoulda' went right but I went left that day. Shoulda' prayed but instead I strayed. Shoulda' gone a different way</segment3>
		<segment4>Shoulda' listened to my mother. When she said that you were no good for me. Shoulda' listened to my pastors. When they told me turn around and leave you be. Shoulda' listened to my sisters. When they said that I was too blind to see. But I see the light somehow. And I vow to listen now</segment4>
		<segment5>I had the chance to advance and it seemed like the best. Opportunity that I could get. I didn't bother to see if my people agreed. Maybe I knew what they would say and yet. I didn't control it I kept going for it. When I shoulda' known it wasn't in God's plan. Had to let go, had I listened before. I would've said no from the door</segment5>
		<segment6>Shoulda' said what I didn't say. Shoulda' went right but I went left that day. Shoulda' stayed but instead I strayed. Shoulda' gone a different way</segment6>
		<segment7>Shoulda' listened to my mother. When she said that you were no good for me. Shoulda' listened to my pastors. When they told me turn around and leave you be. Shoulda' listened to my sisters. When they said that I was too blind to see. But I see the light somehow. And I vow to listen now</segment7>
		<segment8>Shoulda' listened to my mother. When she said that you were no good for me. Shoulda' listened to my pastors. When they told me turn around and leave you be. Shoulda' listened to my sisters. When they said that I was too blind to see. But I see the light somehow. And I vow to listen now</segment8>
		<segment9>Shoulda' listened I know I shoulda' listened. But I know that I vow to listen now. Shoulda' listened I know I shoulda' listened. But you don't have to tell me twice I'm going to listen now. Shoulda' listened if only I had listened. But I've learned my lesson now. I'm gonna listen now</segment9>
		<segment10>Shoulda' listened cause I just can't be missing. All the things God has for me. Repeat till end     </segment10>
