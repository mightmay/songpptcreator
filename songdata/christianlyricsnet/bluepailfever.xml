		<segment1>thy will be done. here on this highway. in every house and field I pray. all in meekness yield. aided by want. among stranger people. to disgrace so soon I've come</segment1>
		<segment2>drift like sleep. into the hotel montana. lay low for thy names sake. el matador louisiana</segment2>
		<segment3>full of bulls blood and what not. coarse jest to a tight knot. you are not acquainted with your own heart. frozen prayer upon my lips. inside the blood runs hot. he was reviled. yet he reviled not</segment3>
		<segment4>like a voice in an empty house. breath your breath. and speak to me. speak to me</segment4>
		<segment5>it's a dry leaf that shivers on the branch. what matter if the wind cast it down. with a ruthless hand. cause we remember always. that it took place forever. thy kingdom come in. whosoever.     </segment5>
