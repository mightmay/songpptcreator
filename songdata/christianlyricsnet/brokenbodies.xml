		<segment1>These words are crawling out of me, They're crawling out, the later it gets. It's so hard, so hard to believe, In the good unfolding, we lack the patience. Come back down, We're all ready now. We're all drowning in our follies, Broken hearts and broken bodies. Come back down, We're all ready now. We're all drowning in our follies, Broken hearts and broken bodies. A line, a sight I've hid behind, Behind your eyes, no greater vision. The life I lead has become, Increasingly the life you lead in me. Come back down, We're all ready now. We're all drowning in our follies, Broken hearts and broken bodies. Come back down, We're all ready now. We're all drowning in our follies, Broken hearts and broken bodies. You've lost your mind, It helps to pass the time. Or you're faced on what could have been, There's a fine line between memory and loneliness. Come back down, We're all ready now. We're all drowning in our follies, Broken hearts and broken bodies. Come back down, We're all ready now. Though our hearts all scream inside us, We don't dream we keep them quiet. Come back down, We're all ready now. We're all drowning in our follies, Broken hearts and broken bodies.    </segment1>
