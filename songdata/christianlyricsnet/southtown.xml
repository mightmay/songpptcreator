		<segment1>Welcome to hard times, back again like it's never been. For the first time it seem to mess with my head. When I realize what it takes, can I relate. With whatever, but never will it drive me to hate. Could be the next guy that you take before I wake. Now I lay me down to sleep, eyes tight when I pray. This here is real life, circumstances make you think. Should I be counting my blessings, the next second my eyes blink. Here in the Southtown you know that kid don't play. Put it down in the streets, will I see another day. If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine. And thank God that I made it alive. One love it's easier said than done. Can I rise above anything that gets in my way?. Like words you say, you let your tongue get loose. And when push comes to shove, I'm not used to walking away. I keep on looking up, because these times are getting tough. Tomorrow's gone and it's the same o' song. Father fill my cup, give me strength to power up. A life to shine, you're the diamond in this rough. It ain't gots to be like this. Don't wanna throw up my fist. Don't wanna be like this. Don't wanna throw up my fist. I must resist. Here in the Southtown you know that kid don't play. Put it down in the streets, will I see another day. If I make it back this time, gots to hold what is mine. And thank God that I made it alive.     </segment1>
