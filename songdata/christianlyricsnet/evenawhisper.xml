		<segment1>Just when you think you've seen it all you find the answer. Looming like a shadow overhead. Reawakens your obsession. To find the truth and put your doubts to bed</segment1>
		<segment2>On and on and round and round. Here among the lost and found. Listen for a certain sound. Even a whisper. Until the truth brings you around. Keeping one ear to the ground</segment2>
		<segment3>And when you finally see the light in all its glory. Shining on the truth of who you are. One more searcher with a story. A wiser fool who's fallowing a star</segment3>
		<segment4>On and on and round and round. Here among the lost and found. Listen for a certain sound. Even a whisper. Until the truth brings you around. Keeping one ear to the ground</segment4>
		<segment5>On and on and round and round. Here among the lost and found. Listen for a certain sound. Even a whisper. Until the truth brings you around. Keeping one ear to the ground    </segment5>
