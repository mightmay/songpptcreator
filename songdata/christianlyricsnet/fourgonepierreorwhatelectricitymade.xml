		<segment1>what dictates, is it your love or your distaste?. as with science, appliances, i'm acquired taste. or chalk beneath your nails, why so afraid, of what electricity made?. comfort please. it takes so little to appease. on the dials, my rivals win. they told me. &quot;there's no need let yourself out to please&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>why so afraid, so afraid. so afraid, so afraid?    </segment2>
