		<segment1>If it's been one time, it's been a million. Try to be perfect, but it's tearing me apart. The fear of failing is so familiar. But you're breaking down the fences in my heart. I'll slow down breathing in, breathing out</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm waking up, I'm breaking out. I'm leaving behind the fear and doubt. I'm letting go, I'll trust and fall. Cause I know there's healing in your arms</segment2>
		<segment3>So I've been striving, running in circles. Through the fight, I've forgotten who I am. God I am longing to break the cycle. To lose myself, so I can start again. Slow down, breathing in breathing out</segment3>
		<segment4>It's time to give it away, gotta give it away. (Give it away) Let your love take over. Love is way you came, you gave it all away. (Give it away) Now love is taking me over</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, yes I know there's healing in your arms. There's healing, healing in your arms    </segment5>
