		<segment1>Two days and I've not slept a wink, these thoughts that I've been thinking. This is the mark I aim to miss. (again)</segment1>
		<segment2>You toss and turn, I lie awake, who knows what I've been drinking. another cheap, meaningless kiss. (to give)</segment2>
		<segment3>From the beginning, dove down, and lost with all his charm. just wanna wake up, wake up in someone's</segment3>
		<segment4>I just wanna wake up. [4x]</segment4>
		<segment5>Six days and I can see the same, brown eyes in this reflection. Is the man you say I'll be? (become)</segment5>
		<segment6>You toss and turn, I lie awake, into the sand were sinking. Holding us back from breathing free. (under)</segment6>
		<segment7>From the beginning, dove down, and lost with all his charm. just wanna wake up, wake up in someone's</segment7>
		<segment8>I just wanna wake up. [8x]</segment8>
		<segment9>More than words, keep to yourself. Like the curse, fairly well.</segment9>
		<segment10>One-man game, one truth to tell. All this blame, hammers your way to hell.</segment10>
		<segment11>I've got a feeling; it's not the safest place to start. This heavy breathing, it seems, we're better off breaking hearts. and at the beginning, dove down, and lost with all his charm. just wanna wake up, wake up in someone's</segment11>
		<segment12>I just wanna wake up. [8x]</segment12>
		<segment13>I just wanna wake up, in someone else's arms. </segment13>
		<segment14>. .     </segment14>
