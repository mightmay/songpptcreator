		<segment1>In the beginning was the beginning, and in it it all began. All that they had was God and the garden, the woman and the man. Before creation learned to groan, the stars would dance and sing. Each moment was new, every feeling was fresh, for the creature her king and queen</segment1>
		<segment2>But deep in the heart of that beautiful garden, forbidden truth was found. They were deceived, disobeyed, and were driven from that holy ground. But beside the tree of disobedience, the tree of life did grow. The gift of its fruit and eternal beginning, but they would never know</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: The beginning will make all things new, new life belongs to him. ?. My child begin again. My child begin again. You're free to start again</segment3>
		<segment4>This very moment is filled with his power, that wee might start anew. To break us away from the past and the future, he does what he must do. And so the Alpha brings to us, this moment to commence. To live in the freedom of total forgiveness, with reckless confidence</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus (X2)    </segment5>
