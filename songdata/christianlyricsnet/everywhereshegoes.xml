		<segment1>Last night I saw her out. In the city crowd. Laughing in the breeze. She smiled at me. Just like a movie scene. It was her and me. Waltzing in our heads. All by ourselves. And as she passed me by. I could see it in her eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Everywhere she goes, she goes there knowing.. I just wanna be with her. Everywhere she goes, she goes there knowing.. I just wanna be.. I just wanna be with her</segment2>
		<segment3>Seems like I see her face. Every couple days. Playing hard to get. I can't handle this. Something about the way she moves. The looks she gives, the attitude. It pulls me in</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>When's she gonna stop these games?. When's she gonna stop?. (Everywhere she goes..). I just wanna be with her</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
