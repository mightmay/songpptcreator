		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on 1 Timothy 4:1, 2 Thessalonians 2:11, 2 Timothy 4:3-4</segment1>
		<segment2>Somewhere in the darkest night a stranger has lost the way. Cold wind and a distant light has carried his heart away. Some say he was one of us, a prodigal gone astray. But inside he's as cold as ice to the truth that he won't obey. He won't discern - the point of no return </segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). In the last daze - the final haze. There was strong delusion to believe a lie. In the last daze before the blaze. They couldn't see beyond their misty trance. To grab the truth and have a fighting chance. In the last daze </segment3>
		<segment4>Cold chills when the Spirit speaks that some shall depart from the faith. All ends in calamity just when they thought it was safe. They followed the lies - the fables men devised </segment4>
		<segment5>Some say it's a certainty, a sign of the times I am told. But I weep for the souls of those who will never return to the fold.     </segment5>
