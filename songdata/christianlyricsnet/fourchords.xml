		<segment1>I was once a boy in love with strangers, As I watched them smoke their cigarettes I'd wave. I was much to young to think of danger, I was curious and innocent and brave. Now the wrinkles in my face have gotten deeper, I'm an old man that's just 25 years young. I try to keep myself away from mirrors, they remind me of the stupid things I've done. Because after all mans intellect and power, All you get is 650,000 hours if you're lucky then you're dead, Says the voice inside my head that keeps me moving one, That keeps me singing these songs, so sing along. Oh, oh, here we go, been down this road about a thousand times before. But we ain't bored. Oh, oh, here we go singing songs we wrote about a thousand times before. But we ain't bored the same four chords, the same four chords. Now the beard upon my face has gotten thicker. To protect me from the storms that come my way. Maybe when life's done I'll be the singer in the band that plays outside of heavens gate. And even if I die tomorrow I'll be glad my life was filled with songs, And even if I die tomorrow these four chords will keep me living on. Oh, oh, the songs that we wrote, are playing back on the radio. Oh, oh, if I die tomorrow these four chords will keep me living on    </segment1>
