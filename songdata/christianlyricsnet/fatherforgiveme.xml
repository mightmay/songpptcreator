		<segment1>Can I take you back to see my old days?. When I walked alone, With my flesh and bone. Can I take you back to see my old ways?. Life so cruel, I played the fool</segment1>
		<segment2>Father forgive me (2x)</segment2>
		<segment3>I've lost my way. I've been lead astray. I've walked this path so many times (2x)</segment3>
		<segment4>Can I take you back to see my old face?. Beaten and bruised, Used and abused. Can I take you back to see my old heart?. So full of hate, Blood contaminate</segment4>
		<segment5>Father forgive me (2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>I've lost my way. I've been lead astray. I've walked this path so many times (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm never alone. I'm coming back (I'm coming back). I'm never alone (4x)</segment7>
