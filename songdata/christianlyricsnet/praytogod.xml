		<segment1>Say what you want about Elvis. Call him the king. It's one thing to die for a people. And another just to sing. Say that the devil's a genius. And be marked for the kill. Say what you want about Yahweh. And He'll love you still</segment1>
		<segment2>Say what you want. Pray to God</segment2>
		<segment3>Say that as long as you don't inhale. You can take your little toke. Say that there ought to be a sin tax. Then we're all going broke. You can say that there ought to be a judgment. And someone's gonna pay. And hope that there's nobody listening. To all the things that you say    </segment3>
