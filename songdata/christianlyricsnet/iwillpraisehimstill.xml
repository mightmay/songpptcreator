		<segment1>When the morning falls on the farthest hill. I will sing His name, I will praise Him still </segment1>
		<segment2>When dark trials come and my heart is filled. With the weight of doubt, I will praise Him still </segment2>
		<segment3>For the Lord, our God, He is strong to save. From the arms of death, from the deepest grave </segment3>
		<segment4>And He gave us life in His perfect will. And by His good grace I will praise Him still    </segment4>
