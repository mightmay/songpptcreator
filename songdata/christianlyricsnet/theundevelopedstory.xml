		<segment1>Taking all what others have hassled. Looking back to darker days getting me down. And if this is chaos. I think that I'm in love with clamor. Tides are turning. never understood my undeveloped story. But it makes sense to me, you make sense to me </segment1>
		<segment2>When it all falls down, I'll still be right here. When it all falls down, we'll still be right here. Once in a lifetime, I could feel this way. Once in a lifetime, you could feel it too </segment2>

The kids are all here, and we're downtown. We're past the morning glory. It's ten past two. and I'm still working on forty     </segment3>
