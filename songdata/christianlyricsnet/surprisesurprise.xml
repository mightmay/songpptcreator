		<segment1>Surprise surprise. I've had such a hard time. Trying to keep my promises</segment1>
		<segment2>The things I say I. Just don't do. I need some rescue. From myself</segment2>
		<segment3>A thousand times, a thousand lies. I just don't understand. Do You believe me anymore?</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: I cannot cross this great divide. Without Your hand. Surprise surprise. All Your wonders never cease. To amaze me; even me</segment4>
		<segment5>I get so nervous. I get so tongue-tied. When I'm around You. My love</segment5>
		<segment6>You see straight through me. My words are empty. But You still believe my promises</segment6>
		<segment7>Mouthfull of fire, I speak desire. And deceitful things. I don't believe me anymore</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
