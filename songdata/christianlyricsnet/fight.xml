		<segment1>She takes the six o'clock train. Its off to work and then home again. She wonders if this will ever change. Clutching her pillow she hides in a dark. Room in her heart</segment1>
		<segment2>How long has it been. Since love touched her and she let in. Chased out the shadows, filled emptiness. With her head in her hands she cries. &quot;Come back again, i need you my friend&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>We fight on our knees. But don't often see. The battles that rage being won. But fight on until. And tarry until. Love comes to carry us on. To kneel with the broken in spirit. And call upon the Son</segment3>
		<segment4>So many holes here within. Torn apart and then blown by the wind. Hell and high-water come crashing in. Pride says to fight but he cannot defend this means to an end</segment4>
		<segment5>The truth cuts like a blade. Bleeding all of the plans that he made. Nothing but faith in the One Who came. Can ever bring peace to the spirit again. Will he understand</segment5>
		<segment6>We fight on our knees. For those who might see. The battle is over, its won. Not by our hands. By the Son of man. He Who is has overcome. Death and the grave hold no power. To those who call upon the Son    </segment6>
