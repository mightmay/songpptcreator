		<segment1>Open up your box of sunshine. And smile as confetti comes raining down on you. You feel a lot like the good guy, but do you know why. Everything's so blue </segment1>
		<segment2>Well, love is fire and the coals are barely burning. Cold fills the emptiness that fills this empty place. I taught you the walk but then you ran away from me. And that's not how it's supposed to be </segment2>
		<segment3>I I collide, with love as an elusive state of mind. I know there's something else it's supposed to be. I, I collide with love as an elusive state of mind. Something's killing me! </segment3>
		<segment4>Tearful confessions have watered down and broken down. The chance for unrequited love to finally reach its wall. You're waiting for the axe to fall. Can't you see it lying on the ground? </segment4>
		<segment5>You could be the best one at cleaning up this mess. Be the best one, be the best one, be the best one     </segment5>
