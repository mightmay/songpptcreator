		<segment1>You're everything. I could want. That I could need. If I could see. You want me. Could I believe?. 'Cause You're perfectly. All I want, all I need. If I could just feel You're touch. Could I be free?. Why do You shine so?. Can a blind man see?. Why do You call?. Do You beckon me?. Can the dear hear the voice of love?. Would You have me come?. Can the cripple run?. Are You the one?</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: To raise me up. From this grave. Touch my tongue. And then I'll sing. Heal my limbs. Then joyfully I'll run to You [2x]</segment2>
		<segment3>Outro: 'Cause You're everything [4x]. And I'm alive and I'll sing. And I'm alive and I'm free [6x]    </segment3>
