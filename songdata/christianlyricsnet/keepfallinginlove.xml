		<segment1>I am found in Your embrace. Covered by Your love. You're my deepest dream I know. Your love so strong, Spirit come</segment1>
		<segment2>You lift me up to heaven's door. You restored my soul. I come here without Your touch. I need You so much, need You more</segment2>
		<segment3>Refrain: You're my rock and my redeemer. The rock on which I stand</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: I keep falling in love with You Lord. Every beat of my heart, breath that I take. Through the seasons that change. Your love remains. My hiding place, my home. Fallin' in love    </segment4>
