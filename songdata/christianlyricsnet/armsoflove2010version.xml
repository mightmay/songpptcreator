		<segment1>Lord I'm really glad You're here. I hope you feel the same when You see all my fear, And how I fail, I fall sometimes. It's hard to walk on shifting sand. I miss the rock, and find IÂ’ve nowhere left to stand;. I start to cry. Lord, please help me raise my hands so You can pick me up. Hold me close, Hold me tighter.</segment1>
		<segment2>I have found a place where I can hide. It's safe inside. Your arms of love. Like a child who's helped throughout a storm, You keep me warm. In Your arms of love.</segment2>
		<segment3>Storms will come and storms will go. Wonder just how many storms it takes until. I finally know. You're here always. Even when my skies are far from gray, I can stay;. Teach me to stay there,</segment3>
		<segment4>In the place I've found where I can hide. It's safe inside. Your arms of love. Like a child who's helped throughout a storm, You keep me warm. In Your arms of love.    </segment4>
