		<segment1>Dawn is here again. And I can't take myself. No I can't. So can I ride the train. With you to get there?. 'Cause I hear it's beautiful. Where this train is gonna stop.</segment1>
		<segment2>So can I ride with you. Can I ride with you</segment2>
		<segment3>I step up to get there, So can I hold on to this. I step up to get there, 'Cause then it's all bliss.</segment3>
		<segment4>You can take me, You can drive the train, Cause I won't burn the bridge again. I don't think I could live without one. Because without one, We would fall into deep, deeper water. I do every day.    </segment4>
