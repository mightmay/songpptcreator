		<segment1>Unbelievable, I'm blown away it's true. By the matchless love that I've found in You. Undeniable, the change in me. I've never felt so free</segment1>
		<segment2>It makes me want to dance. You make me want to dance. When I think about you</segment2>
		<segment3>You love me, You love me. You Love me just the way I am. You love me, You love me. You love me just the way, Just the way I am</segment3>
		<segment4>Ever patiently accepting me. Your love in spite of everything I do. But oh so faithfully. You're committed to the process that makes me like You</segment4>
		<segment5>And I feel like I can dance. Oh You make me want to dance. When I think about how</segment5>
		<segment6>Not when I'm good enough. Not when I clean my act up. Not when I cross the line the thousandth time. And become a better man. Your grace is more than enough. To cover all my sings, Lord wash them away. So right here today. You love me just the way I am    </segment6>
