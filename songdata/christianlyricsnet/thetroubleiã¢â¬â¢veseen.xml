		<segment1>Hey girl, I know what you want from me. I know what you need from me. I know what you need</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey world, I know what you want from me. I know what you need from me. I know what you need.</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Have you seen the trouble that I've seen?. Packed up and weighed down, These voices in my mind. And you know what it takes to stay happy, Time and again.</segment3>
		<segment4>Somehow it came to me. In a moment of silence. Filled with the things I should have said. I know I burned you out. I know I made you try. Only I can change these words I use to tie you down.</segment4>
		<segment5>Have you seen the trouble that I've seen?. Packed up and weighed down, These voices in my mind. And you know what it takes to stay happy, Time and again.    </segment5>
