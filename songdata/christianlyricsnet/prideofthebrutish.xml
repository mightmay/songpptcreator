		<segment1>I can feel you coming after me, I can feel you scream, (I can feel you scream). Your forgiving love won't let me be, I can feel you scream, (I can feel you scream). If I will turn this thing around you will rescue me.</segment1>
		<segment2>And now I've got to let you know that, all along, I know that you were here with me, I wanted to find..just find some peace of mind, but all the pain I feel inside won't let me be.</segment2>
		<segment3>I can feel I'm running out of time, I can feel you scream, (I can feel you scream). But there's no resting for a troubled mind, I can feel you scream, (I can feel you scream). If I don't this thing around I'll be left behind.</segment3>
		<segment4>And now I've got to let you know that, all along, I know that you were here with me, I wanted to find..just find some peace of mind, but all the pain I feel inside won't let me be.</segment4>
		<segment5>And I find I can't lie when I look at you, And I finally realize there's no life without you.</segment5>
		<segment6>And I find I can't lie when I look at you, And I finally realize there's no life without.. And I find I can't lie when I look at you, And I finally realize there's no life without you, And I find I can't lie when I look at you, And I finally realize there's no life without you.    </segment6>
