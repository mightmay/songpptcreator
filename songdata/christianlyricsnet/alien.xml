		<segment1>I feel a stranger in this land. Where every step the gods command. I breathe. And children wander fatherless, Through fields that spent their happiness. I grieve. Take them away to a higher place. Give me a day 'cos I'm losing (face)</segment1>
		<segment2>And I've never felt so alien. Yes I've never felt so alien.</segment2>
		<segment3>I feel danger every day, With every stone we throw away. Careful it's falling, And who will sing a different song?. I hope to God it won't be long. Believe. Show me a way to a higher place. Why is there sunshine on my guilty face?</segment3>
		<segment4>Yes You are brighter than the sun. Only Your love can make us one. Jesus You're brighter than the sun. Only Your love.     </segment4>
