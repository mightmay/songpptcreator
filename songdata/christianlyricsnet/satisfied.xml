		<segment1>All my friends are wondering about the change that's come over me. Ever since I accepted the man from Galilee. Well how can I explain something that I've never, never known before?. It's like walking in the sunshine after a cold and dreary day</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I've got that satisfied feeling down in my soul. Satisfied feeling down in my soul. I've got that satisfied feeling down in my soul. Satisfied feeling down in my soul, all right, yeah!</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>This joy in the Lord was so wonderful, I wanted a little bit more. So I got down on my knees and lifted my hands and I began to praise the Lord. Something started moving way down in the bottom of my soul. Right then that day, you know the Lord filled me with the Holy Ghost</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm satisfied, I'm satisfied. because he satisfied me. he satisfied me. satisfied satisfied..    </segment6>
