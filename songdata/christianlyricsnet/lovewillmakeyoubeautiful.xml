		<segment1>Time is slipping away. Days go by, fade away. With one eye opened, one closed. I think you know. Love will make you beautiful. Love will make you beautiful. Thoughts swirl, spinning around. Weary, falling down. When out of the darkness a hand. Reach out. Hold fast</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Love will make you beautiful. Love will make you beautiful</segment2>
		<segment3>Turn round this time. Love is there to find. Lift your head and see. Open uo your eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)    </segment4>
