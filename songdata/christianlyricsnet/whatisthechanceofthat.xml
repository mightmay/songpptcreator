		<segment1>Tonight Ive been counting railroad cars. Clinking and grinding into the dark. One of them passed with an open door. And I pictured myself jumping on board. What is the chance of that</segment1>
		<segment2>Well Ive always had this thing about trains. A lonesome sound like a man in pain. Going somewhere they dont lose track. Some folks leave and they dont look back. What is the chance of that</segment2>
		<segment3>I have believed since I was a little bitty girl. That there were rules of cause and effect. And they slowly shaped my world. But pain and hard times they come and they go. Like some blindfolded angel somewhere saying. Eeny meeny miny moe. What is the chance of that</segment3>
		<segment4>Why do I feel restless inside. Maybe Im part of a wandering tribe. I want to check my family tree. I think theres a little nomad in me. What is the chance of that</segment4>
		<segment5>Life is a thing you drink in deep. The journey is hard and the journeys sweet. Maybe Ill search and maybe Ill find. Things I wanted were already mine. What is the chance of that</segment5>
		<segment6>I have believed since I was a little bitty girl. That there were rules of cause and effect. And they slowly shaped my world. But pain and hard times they come and they go. Like some test of faith that purifies my soul. Weak belief into something gold. What is the chance of that</segment6>
		<segment7>Tonight Ive been counting railroad cars. Clinking and grinding into the dark. One of them passed with an open door. And I pictured myself jumping on board    </segment7>
