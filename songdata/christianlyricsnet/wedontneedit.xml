		<segment1>You can have the money, wheel it, deel it, win it all. You can have a lot of fashion, you can even own the mall. You can change your face into the person of your dreams. Trim your nose and dye your hair and change your eyes from blue to green. You can be a model cover every magazine. You can walk on every stage or be the host of M.T.V. You can win the medals, run it, swim it, perfectly. You could have a turn at Indy, you could even own the team</segment1>
		<segment2>We're never gonna see God if we keep looking for vogue. We could gain the whole world but still be losing our soul. We don't need it, cuz God has given us our needs. We don't want it, shouldn't he be our priority. We don't need it, Jesus said to leave it all behind. Let's keep our eyes on things above. Cuz we don't need to want to need it</segment2>
		<segment3>You can get a job on Wall Street have more money than you've seen. You can buy administrations and you can even own the queen. You can own a castle oily paintings on the wall. Build a suite for every pleasure, have a disco host a ball. Drive a lamburguini, fast as time and painted red. Leather phone and matching fax and color T.V.s overhead. Take your yacht to Rio, fly your jet up to Cancun. Screamin' down the highway like a rocket to the moon</segment3>
		<segment4>We're never gonna see God if we keep lookin' for vogue. We could gain the whole world but still be losing our soul. We don't need it cuz God has given us our needs. We don't want shouldn't he be our priority. We don't need it Jesus said to leave it all behind. Let's keep our eyes on things above. Cuz we don't need to want to need it. (chorus repeated)    </segment4>
