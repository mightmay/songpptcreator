		<segment2>i was thinking. over thinking. about exactly how i'm not exactly him. i'll break my heart in two. more times than you could ever do. cause you're my dream please come true</segment2>
		<segment3>cause i think way too much. on a one track mind. and you're so out of touch. cause i'm so far behind</segment3>
		<segment4>i can't deny this anymore, the facts ignored all done before. and if there's one in this world, you let me know you're not that girl</segment4>

		<segment10>and while i'm able, i think i'll label. experience with you as a mistake. and while i'm at it, i'll say i've had it. experience with you is a mistake</segment10>
		<segment11>cause i think way too much. on a one track mind. and you're so out of touch. cause i'm so far behind. i'm trying to make sense. out of all of this. while your fading scent. just slips through my grip</segment11>
