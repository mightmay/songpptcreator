		<segment1>You should know me by now. I've always been straight with you. I've always tried to sing about the truth the way I see it, In a mixed up world where truth is. hard to find.</segment1>
		<segment2>I ain't no spiritual superman. Don't always give a shiny, bright example. of what a believer ought to be.</segment2>
		<segment3>I ain't never parted the ocean, though I really think I could. if I had the faith of a mustard seed, like the Bible says I should. I ain't never moved a mountain, I ain't never felt that need. But the one thing God has tought me to see..</segment3>
		<segment4>I can have faith. A mountain of hope. I can even speak with tongues of angels. Tell you everyting I know. But it doesn't mean a thing in this world. Without a mighty love</segment4>
		<segment5>I can be strong. I can stand tall. I can point squarely at the mountain. And command that it be gone. But it doesn't mean a thing in this world. Without a mighty love</segment5>
		<segment6>I ain't standin' no mount. I'm not tryin' to preach to ya. and tell you that I've found all the easy answers. when half the time I can't even. find my keys.</segment6>
		<segment7>But I feel like a regular Billy Graham. when I start talkin' bout my Jesus, and all that he's done for me.</segment7>
		<segment8>Don't you know that I've received forgiveness through no. effort of my own. I've been given so much mercy, so I'll be the last to throw a stone. And I apologize, if you think that I'm coming on too strong. But there's just one thing I want you to know..     </segment8>
