		<segment1>Passed by you today. Why is there a war between us?. Are you not my brother?. Are you not my sister?. Somethings got to change. Stood by you today. Why is there a wall between us?. Are you not my sister?. Are you not my brother?. Well somethings got to change</segment1>
		<segment2>I confess that Ive been blind. Open up this heart of mine. Show me how to love. Farther than this world I know. Take me where You want me to go. Show me how to love</segment2>
		<segment3>I know the times are always changing. But our hearts still beat the same. We have a Father. We have a Savior. And that will never change. I confess that Ive been blind</segment3>
		<segment4>Open up this heart of mine. Show me how to love. Farther than this world I know. Take me where You want me to go. Show me how to love</segment4>
		<segment5>We are one heart beating. We are one body breathing. We are broken and needing. The same love of the Father. I confess that Ive been blind. I confess, start with me, Lord    </segment5>
