		<segment1>Every day is just the same tormented routine. What is wrong with me, do I deserve this pain?. I can see it's not this way for other children. What is wrong with me, do i deserve..?. I sit and I wait by the television for I know the time draws near. I hear the sound of your car turning into the driveway. I hear the sound of your key in the door. I hear the sound of your footsteps coming up the stairs!. No matter what I do, you just run me through. Teach me with the back of your hand. You beat me black and blue. Nothing I can do. Oh, you're such a great big man!    </segment1>
