		<segment1>Who am I trying to fool. As the night falls upon me. Who am I trying to be. When this leads to nothing</segment1>
		<segment2>I need some medication. I need your medication. These choices I've been making. They make me hate myself</segment2>
		<segment3>Are you there?. How I long to be with you. Are you there?. Listening to my despair</segment3>
		<segment4>Standing right at the shore. Knowing life is so much more. I said what she wanted to hear. Pretending that my mind was clear. It's a lie</segment4>
		<segment5>How you wept, how you tried. But I never make the time. Here I go once again. Will this ever end?</segment5>
		<segment6>I need some medication. I need your medication. These choices I've been making. They make me hate myself</segment6>
		<segment7>Are you there?. How I long to be with you. Are you there?. Listening to my despair</segment7>
		<segment8>Standing right at the shore. Knowing life is so much more. Said what she wanted to hear. Pretending that my mind was clear</segment8>
		<segment9>Don't make the call. Into the room. It's where I fall</segment9>
		<segment10>Standing right at the shore. Knowing life is so much more. I said what she wanted to hear. Pretending that my mind was clear. Lying, trying to stop this time. I'll stop this time. One step backward chasing after. A voice inside, A voice inside. That knows.     </segment10>
