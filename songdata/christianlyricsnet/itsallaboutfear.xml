		<segment1>Look at you shake.. I see it on your face.. Why are you so afraid..?</segment1>
		<segment2>Looking down from above for much too long. On the masses you're here to serve. Established as such but never as much as. The voice of the people's word. Decisions of war and who needs thinking for. It's a kiss-up to the 1% and dismissal of the poor. You don't even live by the laws you give. And your welcome here is wearing thin</segment2>
		<segment3>Our fear.. Palms to the sky that wait to be filled. Raised in surrender under the breaking of wills. Deserted, diverted, left to rot and to die. You've used us, abused us, all your promises - lies</segment3>
		<segment4>From the history books and the twisted schools. We've been taught to question you was betrayal. And that you would never think of us as beneath you. That to challenge you would mean to fail. But hope we've received through God and we believe. He remembers the afflicted, his justice will be seen. Though so many have yet to receive his light. Soon they will know the message of Christ</segment4>
		<segment5>Your fear.. A stirring within us has opened our eyes. Surely God above breathes the breath of new life. Though you'd rather we looked to the strength of ourselves. God will be our source of power, and the world we will tell</segment5>
		<segment6>Your fear.. Is our hope    </segment6>
