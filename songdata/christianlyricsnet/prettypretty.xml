		<segment1>Pretty Pretty, she looks so needy. Shes calm in the face, but shes never forgetting every other time Ive been. Angry, raging, clenched up hands. But I know better than to mix you in my raging cycle in this unstable mind. </segment1>
		<segment2>I dont want to let you down. I want this to feel the same. I dont want to let you down. Im all thats in our way. </segment2>
		<segment3>Pretty Pretty, shes slowing fading. Ive drained her empty and left her missing how I was when I was sane. Im drowning in what I became. Stretched so thin that I am slowly tearing. Im left unfulfilled and deteriorating. </segment3>
		<segment4>I dont want to let you down. I want this to feel the same. I dont want to let you down. Im all thats in our way. </segment4>
		<segment5>Waiting, hoping, praying for a settle to this dizzy mind. Feeling that my sanity will be coupled with my demise. </segment5>
		<segment6>I dont want to let you down. I want this to feel the same. I dont want to let you down. Im all thats in our way.     </segment6>
