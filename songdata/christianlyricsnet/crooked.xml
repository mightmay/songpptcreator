		<segment1>I hear those noises. All those familiar voices. Always desturbing in the night time. When can I rest my head in peace and silence?. Knowing what I've done is right.</segment1>
		<segment2>False comfort is no more. Will i hang my head in shame?. No longer will I play this game. This time I'll get it right. This time I won't back down from this battle in my mind.</segment2>
		<segment3>You try and laugh but I don't care if I please you. Go ahead and laugh some more. You think you're seperate, different from all the rest. You try but you're just like us all.</segment3>
		<segment4>False comfort is no more. Will I hang my head in shame?. No longer will I play this game. This time I'll get it right. This time I won't back down from this battle in my mind.</segment4>
		<segment5>False comfort is no more. Will I hang my head in shame?. No longer will I play this game. This time I'll get it right. This time I won't back down from this battle in my mind.     </segment5>
