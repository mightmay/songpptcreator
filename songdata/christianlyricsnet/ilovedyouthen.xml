		<segment1>Pain touches everyone. Heartache falls on every heart. And all of us go through the storm, it doesnt matter who you are. And youre up against the wind, and you feel youve lost your way. Listen to me say</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. I loved you then, I love you now. I will love you tomorrow. When this world breaks you down. I will give you strength to stand. Look to me, take my hand and just believe. Before this day ever began, I loved you then</segment2>
		<segment3>Time changes everything, Moments fly by like the wind. You can try to hold on so tight but youll never get time back again. You feel stuck with your mistakes, cant turn anything around. And it seems theres no way out</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. I wont let you go, not even for a minute. So dont lose hope. Pain touches everyone. Heartache falls on every heart</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS    </segment5>
