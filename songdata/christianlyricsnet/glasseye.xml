		<segment1>deeply shaken see I come that way. ill at ease in my own skin. I hum along to the down home drone. down in my soul to stay. ain't gonna listen to my own noise. even though I love the sound. it come back hollow on hollow. when it come back around. back around</segment1>
		<segment2>quick to anger and quick to speak. afraid to lose these things not mine to keep. the spirit is willing the flesh is weak</segment2>
		<segment3>how long have you been standing there. only here a lonley man. I do. I get behind myself. grieved in my spirit by my hands. seemes he has turned his head. this collector of useless clutter. somethin now has caught his eye. now his words only stumble out in stutters    </segment3>
