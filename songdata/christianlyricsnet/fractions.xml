		<segment1>one in three you're here. to tell me we can't do this anymore. (one in three, you're here to tell me we can't do this. three for three, I will disagree)</segment1>
		<segment2>your hair and face against the mirror. as i take the steps to save what's left of me. someone's out when it's over</segment2>
		<segment3>people steal from you. they take anything they choose</segment3>
		<segment4>it's good to see you. (I missed you last night). that's such a lovely color. (it goes with your eyes). before we fall asleep. (I just wanted to say). this all seems so easy but there are choices to make</segment4>
		<segment5>can't decide, then look at the faces. (candlelight). we're burning the pages. and hurting ourselves with this false start. resign yourself to always be (and we pretend as if it gets easier). without the one thing you need (but does it get easier). debating words with no reply. when we have these mornings where we can say goodbye</segment5>
		<segment6>I wanted to mean everything to you. but this isn't right. you keep coming back disassembled. and I keep losing this fight</segment6>
		<segment7>I won't answer</segment7>
		<segment8>dancing under starlight glow. no one in the city knows. confidence can take you. when nerves try to shake you. from going all the way. it's not that far</segment8>
		<segment9>we watch the tide roll in. (with cold air and coffee cakes). holding our words at lips. (stopping the sounds they make). we know the way to go. (we know what steps to take). to be here    </segment9>
