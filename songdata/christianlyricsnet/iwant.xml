		<segment1>Oh Lord I need some evidence some confidence. I feel so innocent. I feel my pain's been washed away with Your grace. But its just numb the pain</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord I need to know Youre here. I need to feel Your presence Lord. To comfort me to shelter me</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: I want to I need to be with You someday. I want to I need to be with You someday</segment3>
		<segment4>Ive walked down this path at times with a doubt. Not knowing if You'll be there to bail me out</segment4>
