		<segment1>Walking through a maze of giving orders. The narrow aisle so dim. Flourescent light that echoes off the ceiling. Glass that speaks the light that tries to say</segment1>
		<segment2>Bodies fall away with sleep disorder. The mother Mary weeps. Attack and thrust the verbal rust her children. Their burdens lay in sorrow's wake</segment2>
		<segment3>Faith, Seconds away. A love cliche. Show me (Find my way). God sent me a message, find my way. Show me, find my way. While my heart bleeds for you.     </segment3>
