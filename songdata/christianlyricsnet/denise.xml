		<segment1>Waiting for a sign that never came. Waiting, pinching nerves to stay sane. Can't erase the time, forget the past. Knowing good times come and go so fast </segment1>
		<segment2>Denise it's not all set back in time. Denise just lay it down and you'll find. You've changed </segment2>
		<segment3>Nowhere girl, a cage you've come to know. Still wondering, &quot;Where did they all go?&quot;. Plan a recluse life down to the day. While you have chains to lose. And a whole world to gain </segment3>
		<segment4>Denise, Denise it's time. Time to seize the world. Denise it's time </segment4>
		<segment5>Denise it's not all set down in stone. Denise just lay it down and you're home. You've changed     </segment5>
