		<segment1>I built these walls with blinders on my eyes. brick by brick and now I realize. that I'm shut out I'm shut in. and every time I try to reach out I reach in. I break my fingers on the bricks. why do I do this to myself. there is really no one else to blame</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: so could you reach down and pull me out. or am I just too far gone to be saved?. or am I just too far gone to be saved?</segment2>
		<segment3>I take my falls, hands pulled behind my back. you made the knot and didn't leave much slack. now I'm tied up I'm tied down. now every time I try to fly up I fly down. into the sea and hold my breath. I am a mirrored rumble fish. life is so clenching for the kill</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: so could you reach down and break my will. or am I just too far gone to be saved?. or am I just too far gone to be saved?</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm shut out I'm shut in. and every time is try to reach out reach in. I break my fingers on the bricks. now every time I try to fly up I fly down. into the sea and hold my breath. I am a mirrored rumble fish. life is so clenching for the kill</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: so could you reach out and pull me out. or am I just too far gone. you'll never be too far gone    </segment6>
