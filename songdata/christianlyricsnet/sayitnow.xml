		<segment1>Can we work this out. I dont want to close the door. Before the sun goes down. We cant let this go to far. Ill do anything. To meet you anywhere you are. Cuz it doesnt matter anymore. Who was right or wrong. If we could only find the words we lost. Before what we have is gone</segment1>
		<segment2>Say it now, I hope we find a way. To say it now, dont be afraid. To say it now, everything were keeping inside. Dont wait just let your heart speak. Dont waste another heart beat. Cuz well never know. Until we let it out, let it out. Say it say it now. Say it say it now</segment2>
		<segment3>My heart is wearing thin. I dont want to fight a war. That no ones going to win. All this time weve grown apart. Looking for an end. If Im the one thats holding on. Holding back. Heres how we begin</segment3>
		<segment4>Say it now, I hope we find a way. To say it now, dont be afraid. To say it now, everything were keeping inside. Dont wait just let your heart speak. Dont waste another heart beat. Cuz well never know. Until we let it out, let it out. Say it say it now. Say it say it now</segment4>
		<segment5>I hope we leave it all behind. No more getting lost between the lines</segment5>
		<segment6>Can we work this out. I dont want to close the door. Before the sun goes down</segment6>
		<segment7>Say it now, I hope we find a way. To say it now, dont be afraid. To say it now, everything were keeping inside. Dont wait just let your heart speak. Dont waste another heart beat. Cuz well never know. Until we let it out, let it out. Say it say it now. Say it say it now</segment7>
		<segment8>Cuz well never know. Until we let it out, let it out. Say it say it now    </segment8>
