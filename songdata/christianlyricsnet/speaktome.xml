		<segment1>I'm in a fix. need something quick. my mind is numb. my stomach sick. broken hearts. hopeless things. I've seen what defiance brings. cause the light of day. I've always known. is in my heart. I'm not alone </segment1>
		<segment2>speak to me. tell me all the things I need to know. I want to hear you now. can you speak to me. I've opened up your word to free me. I want to hear you now </segment2>
		<segment3>It's amazing. how I forget. can't live my life. for lack of it. but the light of day. I've always known. It's in my heart. I'm not alone </segment3>
		<segment4>speak to me. tell me all the things I need to know. I want to hear you now. can you speak to me. I've opened up your word to free me. I want to hear you now </segment4>
		<segment5>make your wisdom clear. the words I hold so dear. bring the light into my dark. I hide them inside my heart.     </segment5>
