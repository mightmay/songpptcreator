		<segment1>Let's count the time we've spent here. It might just last forever. Though few might understand this, we live for one. And it might seem confusing. But we won't fail to do this. And as you seek our motives, we just have one. How long you've shown. you amplify our calling. Now we will always stay here. and seek the mind that's sleeping </segment1>
		<segment2>Our lives are on the line for you. We'll keep on fighting!. We'll keep on moving on!. Moving on! </segment2>
		<segment3>It's time to sing our music. You know the people lose it. It's clear but they confuse it, we live for one. Now that we sing this song for you. That's only half of what we do. And now the show is over, we might save one. It's true, will you?. New life is in the making. We hope you had your fun here. and now your soul is waking </segment3>
		<segment4>I can see you've played the games. Like you're stuck in all the chains. We will never be the same, the same. Now it's time that you make a change. Let's go far and out of this place. Let's leave while leaving a trace    </segment4>
