		<segment1>- verse 1 -. Sin is my labor, and death is my wage. But You get every paycheck, and i never get paid. To live is for Jesus, and to die would be gain. But still You keep me breathing, day after day</segment1>
		<segment2>- chorus -. And i know Ive earned my death a thousand times. Over and over again. But still You keep loving me. Loving me like holes in your hands.</segment2>
		<segment3>- verse 2 -. Im sure You need me like a spear in the side. So why do you believe me, when You know how i lie?. Youre the only one who sees me through my foolish disguise. Still You wipe these two by fours and tears from my eyes.</segment3>
		<segment4>- chorus -</segment4>
		<segment5>- bridge -. You can see right through all the evil things i do. And somehow You still love the view. So wont You get into all that i cannot undo. And somehow change the view. Im begging You to change the view.</segment5>
		<segment6>- chorus -.     </segment6>
