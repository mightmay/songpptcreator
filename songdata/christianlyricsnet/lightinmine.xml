		<segment1>You have lit up the world all around me. You're a light in mine, so bright. Heart-filled motivation is letting love grow. Your heart-filled motivation is letting love grow. An example worth looking up to. How many can give when it means giving everything?. How many can give when it means giving their all?. If the troubles of this world hold no weight. Then the freedom of today will bring a brighter tomorrow. The kind of man I want to look up to. The kind of man I want looking out for me. When I find myself in need. And the only way out is to rely on someone else. I hope you'd be there. You leave me speechless    </segment1>
