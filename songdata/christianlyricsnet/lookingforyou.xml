		<segment1>Wide awake, chasing sleep. Life's so bittersweet. Like a dream, remembering. When I could talk to you. We were safe in a world of harm. Before I knew it our love was gone. I miss you so much </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm looking for you. Cause you're all that's true to me. You make me smile </segment2>
		<segment3>I had to fall, and lose it all. But that's all right with me. You pushed aside my selfish pride. You opened up my eyes. When I was lost you came to me. You crossed the oceans to set me free. I need you so much </segment3>
		<segment4>Looking for you. Cause you're all that's true to me. You make me smile </segment4>
		<segment5>You, you're all I ever needed. I know, I know. Only you, you're all I ever wanted. I know, I know. You, you're more than a dream. Yeah you're everything. My own symphony. You're my destiny </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm looking for you. Cause you're all that's true to me. You make me smile </segment6>
		<segment7>I'm Looking for you. I sing this for you. Cause nothing's as true. You make me smile. So I smile, yeah I smile. Every time I think of you. I smile, I do. Oh every time I think of you </segment7>
		<segment8>I'm looking for you. Cause you are my soul's desire. I'm searching for you. Yes you are my soul's desire. I'm looking for you. Cause you are my soul's desire </segment8>
		<segment9>I'm all right, I'm okay, it's for sure. Only when I'm next to you. You are my soul's desire. I'm all right, I'm okay, it's for sure. Only cause I'm next to you. You are my soul's desire </segment9>
		<segment10>My soul's desire. My my my soul's desire. Oh yeah, oh yeah. You are, you are    </segment10>
