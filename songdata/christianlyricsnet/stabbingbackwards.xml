		<segment1>How can you call me your friend?. (How can you call me your friend?). You run me around in circles. But your words slide off. You lie, so I won't try to fight you.</segment1>
		<segment2>These words they choke me. They resonate in my heart. My soul won't let me sleep.</segment2>
		<segment3>How can you call me your friend?. (How can you call me your friend?). You bleed me dry with slander. But your words slide off. The grace that I have found without you.</segment3>
		<segment4>These words they choke me. They resonate in my heart. My soul won't let me sleep.</segment4>
		<segment5>And I will rise upon your wings and I will rise above your wings. Stabbing backwards on to you here. Falling backwards on to you. And I will rise, rise above you. And I will rise, rise above you.    </segment5>
