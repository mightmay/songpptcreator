		<segment1>I know that look on your face. I know the secrets you tell. Your every move I can trace. I guess I could say I know you well. But how can I say I know you well</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Cause when I look in your eyes I see a million miles. across an endless sea. I want to sail the waves and make the great discovery. And when I hold you in my arms. The beating of your heart is calling out to me. Im holding a mystery </segment2>
		<segment3>How many songs will be sung and how many words will be said. How many stories of love lie deep within you. Waiting to be read. Well I want your story to be read</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>The beating of your heart. Is calling out to me. Only a God of endless wisdom, love and mercy. Could have created such a wonder as you</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus.     </segment6>
