		<segment1>A modern day moses, waking the streets. With shouts of glory, blistered feet. Hes met the maker, he's met the reason he's alive. And he's on fire inside. A modern day mother, living in the slums. Feeding the hungrey, making sure the race gets run, Always asking if we fought with steady feet. She fights on her knees. Let my people go. A modern day martin in a world of civil words exchange. But dreaming bigger, he thinks maybe he could make a change. Hes heard the stories, he wants some of his own. And he's not alone. (bridge). The time is not the moments here, walk in faith or stand in fear. Change the course of history, did you ever think. No one ever though --- who would have believed?. Let my people go. A modern day me what have i become, what can i be?. If there is greatness out there to be acieved. I want to be more than someone who just passes through this lige. I want to stand up for what is right    </segment1>
