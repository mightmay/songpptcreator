		<segment1>I am the crisis. I am the bitter end. I'm gonna gun this town. I am divided. I am the razor edge. There is no easy now</segment1>
		<segment2>Son of sorrow. Staring down forever. With an aching view. Disenchanted. Let's go down together. With the fatal wound</segment2>
		<segment3>This is the real thing. No rubber bullets now. This is the final bow. My breath avoids me. My chest is in my head. My stomach's upside down. Down</segment3>
		<segment4>Son of sorrow. Staring down forever. With an aching view. Disenchanted. Let's go down together. With the fatal wound. With the fatal wound. With the fatal wound    </segment4>
