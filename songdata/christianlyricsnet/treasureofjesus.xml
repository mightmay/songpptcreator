		<segment1>What can I do. How can I live. To show my world. The treasure of Jesus</segment1>
		<segment2>What will it take. What could I give. So they can know. The treasure He is</segment2>
		<segment3>And if I can sing. Let my song. Be full of His glory. If I can speak. Let my words be full of His grace. And if I should live or die. Let me be found. Pursuing this prize. The One that alone satisfies. The treasure of Jesus</segment3>
		<segment4>And if I can sing. Let my songs. Be full of His glory. If I can speak. Let all my words be full of His grace. And if I should live or die. Let me be found. Pursuing this prize. The One that along satisfies. The treasure of Jesus.     </segment4>
