		<segment1>There's a story where everything could not go right, and I wrote it. I thought about it late last night. Can you feel it?. A tale that feeds on tragedy. Would you read it?. The lessons worth your time.</segment1>
		<segment2>At the end of the story, I'll be alone again, alone again. Does it seem so convincing?. Reckless and undefined, just wasted time.</segment2>
		<segment3>What are pages, but days that never seemed to flow? What are chapters?. Just years I never read. They're all captive. They put the book down years ago. Would you blame them?. I wouldn've done the same.</segment3>
		<segment4>At the end of the story, I'll be alone again, alone again. Does it seem so familiar?. Reckless and undefined, redemption time.</segment4>
		<segment5>All I need is you here 'cause I'm already yours and you are mine.    </segment5>
