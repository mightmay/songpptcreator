		<segment1>Played the game, yes I played it well. Sang hallelujah, had a story to tell. Went to church, sometimes twice a week. Could quote the scripture and man could I preach. Fooled myself, thought I was smart. Religious void filled my heart. A prideful look was my claim to fame but I lived in the hall of shame. Chorus: Darkest Void, Darkest. Can't you see the pain in my eyes. The end must come to all the lies. My mind was like the darkest void. Religious lies must be destroyed. Chorus. Played the game, yes I played it well. Sang hallelujah, had a story to tell. Went to church, sometimes twice a week. Could quote the scripture and man could I preach. My heart was sick, longing for a change. Release me Lord from this liar's game. Need to know you now to make a start. Help me escape, fallacy of heart. Chorus: Darkest Void, Darkest Voooooid!. (Matthew 7:21-23, 2 Timothy 2:19)    </segment1>
