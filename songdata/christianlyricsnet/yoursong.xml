		<segment1>I see a place, I see a face, I'm in my own world and. that's where I'm staying. I feel at peace. Something so powerful, cleansing my entire. And when I hear your song. it makes me feel at ease.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: And when I'm in the mood, maybe. I'll play that song for you. So I'll pop it in again and again. It makes me feel better and I felt so bitter. Too weak, too strong, no right, not wrong. Leave me alone I'm busy listening to her song.    </segment2>
