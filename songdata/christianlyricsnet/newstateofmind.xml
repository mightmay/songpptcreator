		<segment1>She's a lot like grace, she's a lot like grace. I can't live without her and when I'm with her. The world, it looks like a better place. She's a lot like grace, she's a lot like grace. I'm tripping all over my fallen self. She completes me anyways. Hold my heart up to the light Next to you, I'm more than alright I' ve got nothing left to hide. I'm walking around in a new state of mind. She's a lot like mercy, she's a lot like mercy. Getting more than you deserve and your fortune isn't earned. She forgives before you say you' re sorry. Hold my heart up to the light Next to you, I'm more than alright I' ve got nothing left to hide. I'm walking around in a new state of mind. This is a mystery That you would love me. For the rest of my life. All the way to eternity This is a mystery. That you would love me I give you everything On the way to eternity. Hold my heart up to the light. Next to you, I'm more than alright I' ve got nothing left to hide. I'm walking around in a new state of mind Just hold my heart up to the light. Next to you, I'm more than alright I' ve got nothing left to hide. Now I'm walking around in a new state of mind I'm walking around in a new state of mind    </segment1>
