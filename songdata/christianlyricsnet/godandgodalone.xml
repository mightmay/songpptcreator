		<segment1>God and God alone. Created all these things we call our own. From the mighty to the small. The glory in them all. Is God's and God's alone </segment1>
		<segment2>God and God alone. Reveals the truth of all we call unknown. All the best and worst of man. Can't change the master plan. It's God's and God's alone </segment2>
		<segment3>God and God alone. Is fit to take the universe's throne. Let everything that lives. Reserve its truest praise. For God and God alone </segment3>
		<segment4>God and God alone. Will be the joy of our eternal home. He will be our one desire. Our hearts will never tire. Of God and God alone </segment4>
