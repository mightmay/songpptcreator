		<segment1>Load up on grunge and be depressed. Its fun to do for two minutes. Theres no award for self absorbed. Before you know youre 34. Youre old, youre old, youre old, how old?. You're old, you're old, you're old. Man, its nice out, and this day is. Made by God now, celebrate it. Life is too brief, lets complain less. You Nirvana imitators. Look at Dave Grohl, for example. Now hes cheerful, like the Beatles. Yeah!. Now worships not what I do best. Its hardest if I feel depressed. But when I do exalt His name. It always helps to kill the pain. Hallel, hallel, hallel, hallel. Hallel, hallel, hallel. Were alive now, and this day is. Made by God now, and were plain blessed. Dont be stupid couch potatoes. Youre not Elvis in Las Vegas. Try to not go avocado. Try to be mo jalapeno. Yeah!. And I forget things while I praise. Oh, yeah, His blessings make me smile. Ive found its hard, its hard to whine. And yell with Heaven on mind. Hallel, hallel, hallel, hallel. Hallel, hallel, hallel. When were wiped out, and this day gets. Very hard now, and it drains us. Ive read through this in Isaiah. Wait on God now, and Hell take us. From the bottom of the barrel. To the ski slopes, fly like eagles. Jeremiah 29 the leventh line does. Let us smile cause better times are set to find us. Never mind Doug, Wendy Whiner. Get on fire!</segment1>
