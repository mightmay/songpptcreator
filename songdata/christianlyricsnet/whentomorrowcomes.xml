		<segment1>The sunshine of a new day shines upon my face. I don't know where to begin, I don't know how it came to this. If things don't change, maybe I'll be the one that you can't find. I've tried so many times, tried to get it right. Just so our worlds won't collide like two stars in the sky. It's time we both decide to leave this all behind. When the sun goes down, the future's looking bright</segment1>
		<segment2>When all is said and done and tomorrow has begun. Remember today is now yesterday. Can we find a way, find a way to let it go?. Just remember when, when tomorrow comes. Today is now yesterday. Can we let it go?</segment2>
		<segment3>The sunshine of a new day shines upon my face. Reminding me of mistakes, memories I must erase. Here's one more chance for me to throw them all away. Today's a brand new start, we made this way too hard. We both need something like amnesia of the heart. We stand here face to face, see I won't look away. If You just hold my hand, we'll make it through the day.     </segment3>
