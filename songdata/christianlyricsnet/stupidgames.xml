		<segment1>It's funny how things change. We're growing day to day. I remember when we used to say, Wouldn't it be cool, if we could rule the school. We'd walk around just knowing everybody knew our names. The way we combed our hair, and all the clothes we'd wear, Were all a part of one big game of popularity. We tried so hard to only find, It's all about the inside. And all that time, Our frame of mind, was a waste of time. It's funny how things change, We're growing day to day. I remember when I thought that everything was lame. I thought I'd miss the mark, My life needed a spark. If I could only see that I had everything. We tried so hard to only find, It's all about the inside. And all that time, Our frame mind was a waste of time. No more stupid games. No more stupid games. No more stupid games. I said, No more stupid games.     </segment1>
