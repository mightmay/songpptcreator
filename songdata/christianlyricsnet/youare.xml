		<segment1>Lord of empty space. You breathe and then create. Before the earth was made. You are</segment1>
		<segment2>The king of every age. Outside of time and space. All the heavens speak Your name. You are. You are</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord of brilliant light. You separate the night. And everything inside. You are</segment3>
		<segment4>The one who calms the seas. And every part of me. With just a word you speak. You are. You are</segment4>
		<segment5>I give You all of me for all You are. Here I am. Take me apart. Take me apart</segment5>
		<segment6>Angels bowing down. Beneath the rushing sound. A voice that thunders out. You are</segment6>
		<segment7>The one who holds the stars. And the beating of my heart. Exalted above all You are. You are</segment7>
		<segment8>All I am I want to lay down at your feet</segment8>
