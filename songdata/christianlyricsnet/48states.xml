		<segment1>Been to 48 states and a few different worlds. Beheld the blind tour guide and a pig wearing pearls. I've seen grace under foot people fall in the street. Or use it to wipe their feet</segment1>
		<segment2>Never the righteous man forsaken. Never the righteous man</segment2>
		<segment3>Been to 48 states I remember a few. Having higher skylines and a wide angle view. I've seen green lands and the natives stay in one place. Peace falling on their face</segment3>
		<segment4>Where could I be. And stay happy. I hear Hawaii is greener. I hear Alaska is cleaner. Whether here or there the righteous have joy to spare</segment4>
		<segment5>Been to 48 states and few different worlds. I've seen dithered men leave boys, women and girls. Found the church roll full and they're current with dues. To pay for the empty pews</segment5>
		<segment6>Never the righteous man forsaken. Never the righteous man.    </segment6>
