		<segment1>It's the smell of hot summertime trash, it's the city noise of a busy street. it's a train derailed and two car head on freeway crash. each time we meet. &quot;and if it comes as some sort of surprise,&quot; she said. &quot;that I seem so composed, I've kept this moment closer to my eyes,&quot; she said, &quot;than the glasses resting on the edge of my nose.&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>shadow am I!. a question of a person, no said reply. wolf am I!. and shadow cast on the sheep as I pass by. shadow am I, or like a. wearing-black-socks-and-white-woolen-locks. wolf am I, and shadow. </segment2>
		<segment3>she was grace and green as a stem, but I walk heavy on delicate ground </segment3>
		<segment4>(..as I go showing off again,self impressed by how well I can put myself down!!. and then go again, to the next further removed level. of that same exact feigned humility!!!) </segment4>
		<segment5>[this for me goes on and on to the point of nausea] </segment5>
		<segment6>shadow am I!. like suspicion that's never confirmed. but it's never denied. Wolf am I! </segment6>
		<segment7>(no, &quot;shadow&quot; I think is better, as I'm not so much something as the absence of something) </segment7>
		<segment8>So SHADOW AM I!. the material world seems to me like a newspaper headline-. it explicitly demands your attention. and it may even contain some truth. and what's really going on here? </segment8>
		<segment9>one day the water's gonna wash it away. and on that day, nothing clever to say.     </segment9>
