		<segment1>They all wanna talk when I'm not around. But when I'm back in town they're no where to be found. They got things to say about things they don't know. And don't to show of intellectual conversation </segment1>
		<segment2>Words will often hide the truest form of intention. I can see what you all lack inside isn't important enought to mention; </segment2>
		<segment3>They won't deal with themselves wasting time doing something else. Temporary indoor fun they never go out into the sun. My freedom to express has never been reasked more. Since when is it their chore to tell me what to live my life for </segment3>
		<segment4>I know that you wanna hear. I'm gone for good. I know you want me to leave. You won't get rid of me that easy </segment4>
		<segment5>Your hurting words. In the end they'll mean nothing to me. All your lies. In the end your hungry eyes will see. Nothing to me...     </segment5>
