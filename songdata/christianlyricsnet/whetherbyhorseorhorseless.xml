		<segment1>I embark through mountains. the belly of the earth. envelopes me like fountains. uou're not by my side. so who will navigate me. through the leaves and the branches?. unreal foes and creatures. altered forms and features</segment1>
		<segment2>whether by a horse. or horseless carriage, oh-oh. I will return. whether by a horse. or horseless carriage, oh-oh. I will come home</segment2>
		<segment3>careful not to falter. the rumors of the night. invade my ears like laughter. thankful for the lights. that capture all the moths. and guide me with their brightness. gather wood in darkness. speak in tones of softness    </segment3>
