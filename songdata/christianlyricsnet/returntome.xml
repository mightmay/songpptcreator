		<segment1>I remember when you first loved me. And with me was all you wanted to be. Now you've fallen in to the lie within. Seems you're too far gone to come back to me. Don't be discouraged dear one for my forgiveness awaits your hear</segment1>
		<segment2>Return to me. Return to me. I'm longing for the day when you will. Return to me. Return to me. Come back to me..I love you still</segment2>
		<segment3>You defy me, yet you hide from me. Our sacred vowel broken with another choice. As your runnin'. I'm still lovin'. Seems that youd on't recognize my voice. I will continue calling, crying until you hear me say</segment3>
		<segment4>Return to me. Return to me. I'm longing for the day when you will. Return to me. Return to me. Come back to me..I love you still</segment4>
		<segment5>Return to..Come back to me..Come back. My voice that was so familiar to you. Don't let it fade away</segment5>
		<segment6>Return to me. Return to me. I'm longing for the day when you will. Return to me. Return to me. Come back to me..I love you still    </segment6>
