		<segment1>In this place for the rebels and outlaws, away from the fortunate few. We are the blood of the human. Starving for moments with you, for moments with you. House of Zion. Where did those walls go. They've crumbled around me and lay burning down at my feet. Your children are weeping. Show your mercy. They've lost themselves among the deep. In this place for the rebels and outlaws, stones quickly shift in our hands. We shed the blood of the human, and bury our hearts in the sand, our hearts in the sand. House of Zion. Where did those walls go. They've crumbled around me and lay burning down at my feet. Your children are weeping. Show your mercy. They've lost themselves among the deep. House of Zion. Where did those walls go. This fire we started made wreckage of all that We know.    </segment1>
