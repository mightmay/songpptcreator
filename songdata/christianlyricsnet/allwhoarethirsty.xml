		<segment1>All who are thirsty. All who are weak. Come to the fountain. Dip your heart in the stream of life. Let the pain and the sorrow. Be washed away. In the waves of His mercy. As deep cries out to deep. (We sing) </segment1>
		<segment2>Come Lord Jesus come (x3). Holy Spirit come (x3). As deep cries out to deep (x2)    </segment2>
