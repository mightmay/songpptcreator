		<segment1>The beauty in your eyes still sustains me. And I know if I were. To spit in your face. You would take me back. You would love me. You would take me back. I know you would love me. If I were. To stab you in the heart. You wouold bleed for me if it made me happy. If I were to stab you. You would bleed for me. I am nothing that's of worth to you. Take all I have. Though I may never understand it. I won't stop believing. You offer me. Another chance. A new solution. I don't understand it. But I won't stop believing. There is nowhere I would rather be. Than in your arms. You've proven time and again who you are. I continue to run away. But you are right here. You take me back. You are right here. I am nothing that's of worth to you. Take all I have. Though I may never understand it. I won't stop believing. You offer me. Another chance. A new solution. I don't understand it. But I won't stop believing </segment1>
