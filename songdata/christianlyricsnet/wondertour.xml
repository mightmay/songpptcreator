		<segment1>You've already made too many mistakes. To ever amount to anything great. You're not allowed to dream out loud. You're far too young to even count. You're much to poor without any doubt. And you haven't done nearly enough. To deserve any grace or anyone's love</segment1>
		<segment2>God, speak true. To the lies we've believed instead of you</segment2>
		<segment3>You're in the wrong city for that line of work. And you'll never make it unless you're a jerk. Live for yourself and store up more wealth. We've traded in dreams and youthful ideals. For less noble things of paying the bills. And trying our best to look like the rest. While hiding our fears by the way we all dress</segment3>
		<segment4>God, speak true. To the paychecks we have trusted instead of you.    </segment4>
