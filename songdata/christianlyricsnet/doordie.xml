		<segment1>I killed the Son of God today. I built the cross where He was slain. My sins, The hands that held the hammer that drove the nails through His skin. Someday I win. I want to make it up. I want to die to myself for You. It makes me fall apart, When I think of all that You went through. I owe my all to You. (I owe my all to You)</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]</segment2>
		<segment3>Because when it came to do or die. You died for me, Though I would be nothing perfect, For human eyes to see.</segment3>
		<segment4>My hands are Yours for works. My eyes will seek until I've found You. My legs will walk the earth, Until You tell me my work is through. I want to make it up, I want to die to myself for You, You are the one    </segment4>
