		<segment1>You're being tempted by the same ol'. You say it's under control. Just remind me how you see so clearly. Face down in a hole</segment1>
		<segment2>Press toward the light. And the light will ground you. Go with the flow. And the flow will drown you. Hey now, there's always an out</segment2>
		<segment3>But if you get up, get up, get up. You can breakaway. And if you get out, get out, get out. Nothing can overtake. Don't wait, escape</segment3>
		<segment4>We get beaten by the same sticks. Until we start to crack. We get deceived by the same tricks. That's why the devil's bringing 'em back. (He's bringing 'em back)</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't believe the hype. It's such a letdown.     </segment5>
