		<segment1>Hi there. Remember Lee?. He's the one you said had two left feet and he danced like a paraplegic. Boy that made Lee sick. You know that you said that he was fat until that time you saw him hanging with her. So, no thank you. Disgrace, get out of my face. Security, please come and escort her from my view. Why thank you.. no tip for you. Please don't hate me. I'm poor just like you. It's that I know that when all is said and done. Here comes another one. Another one. Here comes another one. Listen leave me alone. Here's some reason why you must stay home and never go to our next show. Cuz I'd never stoop so low. All that time that you thought that you were bad. I said to myself &quot;You are the night stalker.&quot;. And now that I've seen you I know that it's all true. Those things you said weren't even like you. So how does it feel now to finally be dissed?. Now you know that you'll never be missed. It's just that I know that when all is said and done. Here comes another one.     </segment1>
