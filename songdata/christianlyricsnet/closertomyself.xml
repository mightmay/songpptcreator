		<segment1>Digging deep, I feel my conscience burn. I need to know who and what I am. This hunger jolts me from complacency. Rocks me, makes me meet myself</segment1>
		<segment2>Jacob walked a limp to remind him. Of the greater gift of the greater one. But when I fell, I fell to my own resources </segment2>
		<segment3>How can I carry the truth if I can't even crawl to you?. I wanna feel something sweeter than this sin. Cover me in leaves roll me over again. I've been everybody else now I want to be. Something closer to myself </segment3>
		<segment4>Paint me in a different light. Shed me yet another coat of skin. Mark me with ash until I'm clean again. 'cause I'm so sick and tired of being sick and tired. I know I can love you, I know that I can La di da di da di da    </segment4>
