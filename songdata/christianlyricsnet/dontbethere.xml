		<segment1>Don't be there, don't be there, 'Cause I'm on my way, And I'm already gone over, And I'm on my way. hey.. </segment1>
		<segment2>I can't recall myself how I went down, Did I get shot or shoot myself? </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm down here, I'm down here, And you're way up there, That doesn't hurt, badly, But it stings right here, hey.. </segment3>
		<segment4>I can't recall myself how I went down, Did I get shot or shoot myself? </segment4>
		<segment5>And I won't pretend there's nothing there, You'll be around and I'll be square. Don't be alarmed if I'm not there, You'll be around and I'll be square. </segment5>
		<segment6>If you're a rose then I'm the thorn. that's in your side, And does it hurt badly?. 'Cause it burns right here. </segment6>
		<segment7>I can't recall myself how I went down, did I get shot or shoot myself? </segment7>

		<segment9>And I can't recall myself how I went down, Did I get shot or shoot myself? </segment9>
		<segment10>And I won't pretend there's nothing there, You'll be around and I'll be square. Don't be alarmed if I'm not there, You'll be around and I'll be square. Don't be around, Don't be there, Don't be there.    </segment10>
