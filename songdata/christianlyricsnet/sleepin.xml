		<segment1>When I watch you sleep. I am taken from the place I stand. Taken to a place where no cares. I never thought I could be so lucky to be with you. Always knew. Afraid it would end. When I wake up in the morning. And you are still next to me. I just thought to which I woke a dream. I can't believe it's better than I thought it could be. You'll always mean everything. And now whoa oh whoa. I don't need to worry. I am figured out whoa oh whoa. I don't need to worry. I have figured you. Take all my worries. They just don't matter to me. You take all my worries. They just don't matter to me. You take all my worries. They just don't matter to me. You take all my worries. They just don't matter to me.     </segment1>
