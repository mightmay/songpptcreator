		<segment1>God rest ye merry, gentlemen. Let nothing you dismay. Remember, Christ, our Saviour. Was born on Christmas day. To save us all from Satan's power. When we were gone astray. O tidings of comfort and joy, Comfort and joy. O tidings of comfort and joy</segment1>
		<segment2>From God our Heavenly Father. A blessed Angel came;. And unto certain Shepherds. Brought tidings of the same: How that in Bethlehem was born. The Son of God by Name. O tidings of comfort and joy, Comfort and joy. O tidings of comfort and joy. Comfort and joy</segment2>
		<segment3>Now to the Lord sing praises, All you within this place, And bring your hearts before Him. His mercy to embrace. For He has shown His love to us. The miracle of grace. O tidings of comfort and joy. O tidings of comfort and joy. O tidings of comfort and joy. O tidings of comfort and joy. O tidings of comfort and joy. Comfort, comfort and joy. Comfort and joy.     </segment3>
