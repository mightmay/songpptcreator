		<segment1>This is the noise we make. With our voice and with our hands. We come to celebrate all across his land. Yeah. The joy that's in our hearts. Makes us want to dance for you. Join as the angels sing and worship as they do. And we worship you alone with our songs and praise. One day before your throne. This is the noise we make</segment1>
