		<segment1>You know me very well. more than I know myself. You know the frailness of my frame. and still You show Your love. in measures deep and wide. the kindness of a king who saves. lead me onward towards the cross. I give myself to You. that I may know You more. You're the love of my life. You're the arms open wide. I know Your presence is here in this place. Lord I surrender all that I am. to the love of my life. knowing my heart would fail. You made a way for me. You died to set this captive free. in this You've shown Your love. within my darkest hour. that's why my prayer will always be    </segment1>
