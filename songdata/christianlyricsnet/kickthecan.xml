		<segment1>I cant pretend this will help you in the end. Your medication needs, are gonna help you sleep through the night. Im a doctor but Ill try; Ive got a heart that cares. Ive got a heart that bleeds. So, well play kick the can. Itll make us young, like Serling says. Itll make nothing scary. Time will remind. I want to help you to revise your remembering of only pretty things in your life. Im a doctor but Ill try; Ive got a heart that cares. Ive got a heart that bleeds. So, well play kick the can. Itll make us young, like Serling says. Itll make nothing scary.    </segment1>
