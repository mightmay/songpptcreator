		<segment1>Im just the boy inside the man, not exactly who you think I am.  Trying to trace my steps back here again, so many times.  Im just a speck inside your head, you came and made me who I am.  I remember where it all began, so clearly</segment1>
		<segment2> I feel a million miles away, still you connect me in your way.  And you created me, something I wouldve never seen.  When I can only see the floor, you made my window a door.  So when they say they dont believe, I hope that they see you and me.  After all the lights go down, Im just the words you are the sound.  A strange type of chemistry, how youve become a part of me.  And when I sit alone at night, your thoughts burn through me like a fire.  Youre the only one who knows, who I really am</segment2>
		<segment3> We all wanna be somebody, we just need a taste of who we are.  We all wanna be somebody, were willing to go but not that far</segment3>
		<segment4> And were all see through, just like glass.  And we can shatter just as fast.  That lights been burned out for a while, I still see it every time I pass.  It was lost in the coldness of my mind, behind a box of reasons why.  I never doubted it was there, just took a little time to find.  And even when..</segment4>
		<segment5> I feel a million miles away, still you connect me in your way.  And you created me, something I wouldve never seen.  When I can only see the floor, you made my window a door.  So when they say they dont believe I hope that they see you and me.  After all the lights go down, Im just the words you are the sound.  A strange type of chemistry, how youve become a part of me.  And when I sit alone at night, your thoughts burn through me like a fire.  Youre the only one who knows, who I really am</segment5>
		<segment6> We all wanna be somebody, we just need a taste of who we are.  We all wanna be somebody, were willing to go but not that far.  We all wanna be somebody, we just need a taste of who we are.  We all wanna be somebody, were willing to go but not that far</segment6>
		<segment7> Im just the boy inside the man, not exactly who you think I am.  Trying to trace my steps back here again, so many times.  When I can only see the floor, you made my window a door.  So when they say they dont believe, I hope that they see you and me    </segment7>
