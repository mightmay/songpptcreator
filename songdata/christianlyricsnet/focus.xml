		<segment1>The deficit, environment, a government corrupt. So many things to worry us and tangle our minds up. We know we're being taken, we know it all too well. We know that something must be done but there's more to tell</segment1>
		<segment2>Where are you going? what's your focus?. Losing your reason? for a..lie</segment2>
		<segment3>Caught up in the cause, the fight, caught up in the roar. You know that your intentions are right in what you're fighting for. But in the midst, the heat of it all, don't forget your drive. We're hear to do the father's will our reason to survive</segment3>
		<segment4>There's so much going on around us and we must be aware. It's important that they see our love and that we truly care</segment4>
		<segment5>Oure time for lying dormant while the world is so in need. Is over now but don't forget the purpose of your doing    </segment5>
