		<segment1>Spoken word has lost it's way again. Wondering through silenced apology. An untamed mouth has not held words not meant. And condescending eyes made shame to see</segment1>
		<segment2>The stress to succeed has broken trust. My flooding waters wash you out to sea. You're drowning now as my forgiveness rusts. To stiff to rescue what's dear to me</segment2>
		<segment3>Could I be sorry enough to make you not be sorry. For goodness sakes I'm sure you're sorry. You met up with likes of one who can't be sorry for his....</segment3>
		<segment4>Imperfection driving battery. The lingering spirit begins to fold. Spoiled angst rots the adult in me. As childish antics now are growing old</segment4>
		<segment5>Now an emptied room to play to. (No one to hear this song). No more innocence left to be hurt. Now the silence that I wait through. (Speaking oh so loud). Of this fitting end that I deserve</segment5>
		<segment6>Could I be sorry enough to make you not be sorry. For goodness sakes I'm sure you're sorry. You met up with likes of one who can't be sorry for his....</segment6>
		<segment7>Another way fought and anger fed again. Another day lost, we've found more hate to send. Some other past time we found some way. To see thee others flaws as small. and still forgive other's mistakes. We had no time to let unity ever binding lose control. Or let some standard conditioning our likeness take it's toll. When the differences settle. and when the spite comes to an end. We'll be reminded of a time when me. and you used to be friends. (Always change in me)    </segment7>
