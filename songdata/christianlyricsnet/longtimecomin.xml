		<segment1>Well I've been taking. It all for granted. Everything that I, have been givin'. Now it is the day, to start my mission. It's been a long time a comin'</segment1>
		<segment2>There are many, searching for answers. Tell me who am I, to keep it to myself?. I've grown weary of my own fears. It's been a long time a comin'</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Well I've been running just like an outlaw. And I am willing and able. To give you something that you can believe on. It's been a long time a comin'</segment3>
		<segment4>True believers, Have been staring, up into the sky. Waiting for your return. And I know one day. The clouds will roll down. It's been a long time comin'    </segment4>
