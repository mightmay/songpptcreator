		<segment1>I'm giving weight to circumstance. You swear I'm hopeless. This time just isn't like the last. I said that last time, last time too</segment1>
		<segment2>This could be. This could be over, the summer's almost gone. This could be history. It's over, the clouds are breaking now</segment2>
		<segment3>All that is seperating us. Years and minutes. But some days I can't wait for the end. Perspectives changing, changing again</segment3>
		<segment4>This could be. This could be over, the summer's almost gone. This could be history. It's over, the clouds are breaking now</segment4>
		<segment5>And all of the looks that you keep on giving me are killing me. And some of the words that I say are so naive. Forgive me </segment5>
		<segment6>This could be. This could be over, the summer's almost gone. This could be history. It's over, the clouds are breaking now</segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
