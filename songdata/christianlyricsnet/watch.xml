		<segment1>The dust is settling now, I can see your expression. The look on your face is asking me howk how can you leave me here?. My words are falling to the ground, in one ear out the other. I'll just have to live it out</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Watch these chains fall from my hands. Then you will understand, then you will understand. Watch me walk through these prison bars. Then you will know my heart is free. Emptiness plagues you inside, you're surrounded by sorrow. It follows you where you hide, and exposes you every time. There is life beyond this crippling cage, and shelter from the rage. Only you can decide..</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>For the first time I'm alive. no longer pressed by doubt and fear. No longer drowning in my tears. He saved me from going under</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus    </segment5>
