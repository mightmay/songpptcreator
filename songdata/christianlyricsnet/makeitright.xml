		<segment1>Wont make do with your games. And your slamming the door. So fall down, fall through. So have done with your vice and your virtue</segment1>
		<segment2>It will take a lot to make it right</segment2>
		<segment3>Prattle with your voice. And its sounding off. Sounding like white noise. If we fall, divide. If its yours to choose. Then go and decide. Cuz if its mine I wont let it ride</segment3>
		<segment4>I will take a lot to make it right</segment4>
		<segment5>Didnt I stay?. And didnt you wait?. And didnt I care. When you were crying?</segment5>
		<segment6>It will take a lot to make it right    </segment6>
