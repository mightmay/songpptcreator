		<segment1>Through the fire and water. You have faithfully. Brought us to this place. Of abundance. And your face. Shines upon us. You give. Abundant showers of grace. To refresh your weary people. Stir us again. For revival. That your ways be known. On the earth</segment1>
		<segment2>So let the rains pour. Down harder. Let the river run wider. Let the winds carry farther. Let the fire burn brighter. The spirit of revival</segment2>
		<segment3>Let it roll like the smoke. Let it roll like the sea. Let the spirit of revival. Come roll over me. Roll over me</segment3>
		<segment4>The lord announces his word. And his people proclaim it. And this move of his spirit. No words and describe it. No darkness can hide it. So the land will yield its harvest. And the lord god will bless us. And the whole earth. Will fear him. The kings will revere him. And glorify jesus    </segment4>
