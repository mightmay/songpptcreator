		<segment1>Just the other day went walking. Down to the corner and I saw a man. Sitting with a cup in his hand. Saying, &quot;Hey won't you give me something. Won't you give me something to eat?&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>I took a look into his eyes and. I saw he had a story to tell. But I walked away with my pockets full, full of change. And I said, &quot;I got nothing for you&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>It's time to confess that I need a little more. Jesus inside of me, Jesus inside of me</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't you see, Jesus was homeless. Walking from city to city. Teaching people how to love. Giving them grace and mercy. Giving them grace and mercy</segment4>
		<segment5>Now, Jesus was a friend to the friendless. Loving on all the outcasts. Teaching them that there was more. More than what they're living for. More than what they're living for</segment5>
		<segment6>Don't you see, if you do not learn love. Then you will be completely nothing. You could be absolutely amazing. But you would be nothing    </segment6>
