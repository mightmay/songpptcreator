		<segment1>overwhelmed cause it's just like falling again. i know it well. is this me or is this real. thought i knew the drill. as it turns out i didn't know a thing. overwhelmed here i go again. overwhelmed with joy with pain. it makes it all clear. a wishing well. i wished for something. but what i got was even better. his will is the only thing. that will ever make it last. overwhelmed there will be. no again i found something nervous. waiting wait for better things to come. just wait one more one more minute. then it will be mine alone    </segment1>
