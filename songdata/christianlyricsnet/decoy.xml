		<segment1>Close your eyes and make believe. This is where you wanna be. Forgetting all the memories. Try to forget love 'cause love's forgotten me</segment1>
		<segment2>Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late. Pretty soon you won't remember a thing. And I'll be as distant as stars. Reminiscing, your heart's been wasted on me</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]</segment3>
		<segment4>You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you. My little decoy, don't look so blue. You should have seen right through. I'm using you. My little decoy. My little decoy!</segment4>
		<segment5>Living life inside a dream. Time is changing everything. Forgetting all the memories. And I'm forced into you. Just cause you're into me</segment5>
		<segment6>Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late. When I'm gone you won't remember a thing. But I can't stay and no, I won't wait. I was gone from the very first day</segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus]</segment7>
		<segment8>You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you. My little decoy, don't look so blue. You should have seen right through. I'm using you. My little decoy</segment8>
		<segment9>I'm not sorry at all. (Not sorry at all, not sorry). No, I won't be sorry at all. (Not sorry at all, not sorry, no). I'd do it over again</segment9>
		<segment10>(Don't look so blue). My little decoy. (You should have seen right through). My little decoy. (You've never been so used)</segment10>
		<segment11>My little decoy. (As I'm using you). My little decoy    </segment11>
