		<segment1>I tried perfecting myself. Would You love me more without my mistakes. I tried not to ask for Your help. Cuz I didnt want to scare You away</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah I was always worried. I was gonna let You down. Oh, it felt like I was standing. In between the lost and found</segment2>
		<segment3>Till I got to know You. You, I was at a place when You found a way. To break through. Its true. I was just a skeptic. Till I got to know You, You</segment3>
		<segment4>And its hard accepting Your grace. In a world where nothings free. For so long I was afraid. That Youd only see the worst in me</segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, I was always worried. You were gonna figure out. That I wasnt what You wanted. Wasnt worth being around</segment5>
		<segment6>Till I got to know You. You, I was at a place when You found a way. To break through. Its true. I was just a skeptic. Till I got to know You, You</segment6>
		<segment7>And you have always been on my side. I finally see it. It took so long to believe in it. Cuz I was always worried. I was gonna let you down. Till I got to know You, You. Till I got to know You, You, You</segment7>
		<segment8>Till I got know You, You. I was at a place when you found a way. To break through. Its true. I was just a skeptic. Till I got to know You    </segment8>
