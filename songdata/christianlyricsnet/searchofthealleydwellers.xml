		<segment1>We're searching alleys. to find an alley dweller.. the haunted. the horror.. we're searching alleys. to find the best of the worst.</segment1>
		<segment2>all this means nothing. all things are glorified.. I'll sort this out. I'll set it all aside.</segment2>
		<segment3>tell all the children. you're larger than life.. you're greater than great.. you're better. you're better.. than all of the rest.</segment3>
		<segment4>my brother sees it. my brother sits back in line.. as if to watch it. as if to watch it all fade.. watch it fade. watch it all fade. watch it fade. watch it.</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll sort this out. I'll set it all aside.</segment5>
		<segment6>aww. cut-throat.</segment6>
		<segment7>oh alley dweller. pull yourself together now.. oh alley dweller. it's your time to come out of the shadows.</segment7>
		<segment8>if you want to save the world forget it.. if you want to judge the rest get with it.. get with it. yeah.</segment8>
		<segment9>I'd save the world. for just a second of time.. I'd set you free. for just one single dime.</segment9>
		<segment10>my brother sees it. my brother sits back in line.. as if to watch it. as if to watch it all fade..     </segment10>
