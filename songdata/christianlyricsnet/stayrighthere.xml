		<segment1>rom here, from outside, you're surrounded by light, I feel inside, My heart beating faster and I can't fight.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I will stay right here, wait for the light, I will wait for you all night, My heart is pounding way too hard to fight, I will wait for you all night.</segment2>
		<segment3>The tears from your eyes, they remind me that I..I'd give my own life, Just one fateful disaster, if that's the price.</segment3>
		<segment4>And I will stay right here, wait for the light, I will wait for you all night, My heart is pounding way too hard to fight, I will wait for you all night.</segment4>
		<segment5>Wait right here, Wait right here for.. Wait right here, I'll wait, You're the only one for me, Stay right here 'til you say, The one for me, Stay right here 'til you say.</segment5>
		<segment6>And I will stay right here, wait for the light, I will wait for you all night, (stay right here 'til you say). My heart is pounding way too hard to fight, (stay right here 'til you say). I will wait for you all night.    </segment6>
