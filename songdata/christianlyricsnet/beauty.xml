		<segment1>Beauty unbounded lies in your mind. It shines in your face and speaks through your eyes. Sour still the memories of past words and fears. Clouds thich the joy of happier years </segment1>
		<segment2>Sorrow unmeasured runs through your frame. Pulling you down and taking your strength</segment2>
		<segment3>Sorrow unmeasured runs through your frame. Pulling you down and taking your strength. Stars in your eyes and dreams in your heart. Are almost in reach yet a little too far.     </segment3>
