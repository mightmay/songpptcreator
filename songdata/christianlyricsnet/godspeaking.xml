		<segment1>Have you ever heard a love song. That set your spirit free. Have you ever watched a sunrise. And felt you could not breathe. What if it's Him. What if it's God speaking. Have you ever cried a tear that. You could not explain. Have you ever met a stranger. That already knew your name. What if it's Him. What if it's God speaking </segment1>
		<segment2>Who knows how He'll get a hold of us. Get our attention to prove He is enough. He'll do and He'll use. Whatever He wants to. To tell us I love you </segment2>
		<segment3>Have you ever lost a loved one. Who you thought should still be here. Do you know what it feels like. To be tangled up in fear. What if He's somehow involved. What if He's speaking through it all </segment3>
		<segment4>His ways are higher. His ways are better. Though sometimes strange. What could be stranger. Than God in a manger </segment4>
		<segment5>God is speaking. I love you    </segment5>
