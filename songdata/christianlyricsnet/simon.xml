		<segment1>Catch your breath hit the wall. scream out loud as you start to crawl. back in your cage the only place. where they will leave you alone. 'cause the weak will seek the weaker until they've broken them. could you get it back again. would it be the same. Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense. left you with no defense they tore it down </segment1>
		<segment2>And I have felt the same as you, I've felt the same as you, I've felt the same</segment2>
		<segment3>Locked inside the only place. where you feel sheltered where you feel safe. You lost yourself in your search to find. something else to hide behind</segment3>
		<segment4>The fearful always preyed upon your confidence. Did they see the consequence when they pushed you around. The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones. Breaking them 'til they've become just another crown</segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge). Refuse to feel, Anything at all. refuse to slip, Refuse to fall. can't be weak, Can't stand still. you watch your back,'cause no one will </segment5>
		<segment6>You don't know why they had to go this far. traded your worth for these scars. for your only company. don't believe the lies that they told to you. Not one word was true. you're alright, You're alright, You're alright    </segment6>
