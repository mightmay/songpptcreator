		<segment1>Deep in that cranial psycho vault. the thought you are to be sans fault. it ain't meant to happen on our own. the consequence of diligence. without Him will show all the dents. that's why our eyes are always on the throne</segment1>
		<segment2>What's wrong with me, what's wrong with you. how many times we've fallen through. the thin dev-ice of foolish thinking. all along our pride is sinking</segment2>
		<segment3>The smoothness of another day. convice me that I'm on my way. at 3 pm it all falls flat. I realize I ain't all that</segment3>
		<segment4>Stumble foot foot stumble. as your ideals start to crumble. stumble soot foot fumble. just another chance to be humble. Stumble foot foot stumble. as your ideals start to crumble</segment4>
		<segment5>The consequence of diligence. without Him will show all the dents. You point out others' sins overt. under the carpet, sweep your dirt.     </segment5>
