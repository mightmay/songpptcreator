		<segment1>When I wake in the morning. I want to blow into pieces. I want more than just okay, more than just okay </segment1>
		<segment2>When I'm up with the sunshine. I want more than just a good time. I want more than just okay, more than just okay </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm not givin' up, givin' up now. I'm not givin' up, not backing down </segment3>
		<segment4>More than fine, more than bent on getting by. More than fine, more than just okay </segment4>
		<segment5>When I'm lit with sunrise. I want more than just the blue skies. I want more than just okay, more than okay </segment5>
		<segment6>More than oceans away from the dawn. More than oceans away from who we are. More than oceans, more than oceans, More than fine    </segment6>
