		<segment1>With a longing heart you turn the tides and say goodbye. With a love that always fades. You hold on so tight, hold back the tears. Legacy that strays so strong is pulling at your heart. All the castles that you made are falling apart. Love is waiting here</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Come back, in these places. In these places this is all that you need when you want to come back</segment2>
		<segment3>Blowing in the wind a taste of something tragically. Comes to find you when you fall and when you're in need. See beneath the skin. Always waiting is a love that moves. Your pains away. Always waiting will embrace and wash tears away. Places where this begins</segment3>
		<segment4>You make believe that the world is never going to mount you. (this place is safe). That your love is always going to stay true. What do you see when you fall asleep. (Jesus in longing). That you will want the blood his hands can bleed    </segment4>
