		<segment1>Rise up to love find your voice in the crowd. Sing your song aloud to those who just oppose the sound. We've got such a long way to go. Learning to trust while losing full control. Come fashion me for all to see. You and me</segment1>
		<segment2>This is a sure shot why can't we just stop. And lose our gravity rise up to reality. This is a sure shot why can't we just stop. Echoing the world</segment2>
		<segment3>I hear you sweet so soft and and subtle voice. Calling my name yet whispering your words to me. A sure shot guarantee. So wake me up I've had enough. I've shut you out and closed my mouth. To long to bleed sincerity I'm not into deep I'm awake. In you I found escape</segment3>
		<segment4>This is a sure stop why can't we just stop. And lose our gravity rise up to reality. This is a sure stop why can't we just stop. Echoing, echoing</segment4>

Echoing your name. Today    </segment5>
