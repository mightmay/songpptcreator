		<segment1>Hey, don't wanna run no more. Hey, must find an open door. Hey, ask him to step inside. Hey, I'm tired of this life</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't wanna waste away. Like I saw myself fading yesterday. I don't wanna feel the shame. I don't wanna waste away. Like I saw myself fading yesterday. I don't wanna feel the pain. I don't wanna waste away</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey, walk on but don't come forth. Hey, find what I lost before. Hey, must change the shape I'm in. Hey, never go back again</segment3>
		<segment4>(CHORUS)</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm coming to know. I'm coming to see you now (see you now). I'm coming to go. I'm coming to see you now, Believe you now</segment5>
		<segment6>I don't wanna waste away, I don't wanna waste away</segment6>
