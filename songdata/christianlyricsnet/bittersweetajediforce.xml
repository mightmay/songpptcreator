		<segment1>Release the gate of beautiful, I am staying down to hide in rooms away. These tears they build me up a house, then they pour on down and wash the house away. And I am left to fight the waves (he's around me constantly)</segment1>
		<segment2>I kissed these lonely tears I shed goodbye. Beacuse I'm bittersweet, without you father. There's no reason</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold up my heart it makes me feel, like these rooms will close in locking all the doors. With these hands and broken stones, I have built a legacy and now it's time to move on</segment3>
		<segment4>He's around me constantly. So get off of my soul    </segment4>
