		<segment1>There's something in the way you say my name. That makes me sure that. The feelings that you're feeling are the same. As the ones that I have for you. I adore you</segment1>
		<segment2>The times we spend together never last. As long as I'd like. And everyday the sun goes down too fast. Sit here for as much time as you can get. You and me watching the sunset</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause every time I see your face. My heart leaps and I melt inside. And every time you talk to me. I have a hard time seeing past those eyes. And all I want is for you to say. &quot;Darling, I feel the same way as you&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>There's times when you don't feel like talking on the phone. But still you listen and. You walk me to my door when you take me home. You lean closer and then you kiss me. And say that 'til tomorrow you'll miss me</segment4>
		<segment5>'Cause every time I see your face. My heart leaps and I melt inside. And every time you talk to me. I have a hard time seeing past those eyes. And all I want is for you to say. &quot;Darling, I feel the same way as you&quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>Sit here for as much time as you can get. You and me watching the sunset. It can't get much better than this</segment6>
		<segment7>'Cause every time I see your face. My heart leaps and I melt inside. And every time you talk to me. I have a hard time seeing past those eyes. And all I want is for you to say. &quot;Darling, I feel the same way as you&quot;     </segment7>
