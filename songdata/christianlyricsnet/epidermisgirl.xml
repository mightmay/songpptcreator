		<segment1>Sweetness whispers nothings in my ear. Nothing is exactly what I hear. With a glaze she gazes into space. Is there nothing more?. There must be something more. I can see that beauty is more than skin. My infatuation leads me to sin. Give me vision past the epidermis girl. Is there nothing more?. There must be something more. </segment1>
		<segment2>I find a want, I want a need, I need a deeper love. I find a want, I want a need, I need a deeper love.</segment2>
		<segment3>Sweetness whispers nothings in my ear. Nothing is exactly what I hear. Give me vision past the epidermis girl. Is there nothing more?. There must be something more.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus x2    </segment4>
