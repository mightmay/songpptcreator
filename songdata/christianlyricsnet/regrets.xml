		<segment1>As I stand here and wait for you, you don't know how I feel. Guess I'm too shy to let you know. My heart's in control. This time I know that everything will be okay. I don't know what you would think. I don't know what to expect. No matter what happens you will be my friend. I'm not going to mess this up. I don't want to end with regrets. I can't stop thinking of you, can't get you out of my thoughts. Can't concentrate, I'm losing my head over a girl. I know I'll always love you. I wish that you felt the same.    </segment1>
