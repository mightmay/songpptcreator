		<segment1>Are we, are we just selfish?. Wanting to keep you where we are. Just where you left us. Youre seeing all the things Id die to see. Everybody finds it necessary. To say how much you loved me. As if I didnt know so deeply</segment1>
		<segment2>Can you see evidence of perfection. Look past the circumstance and find some meaning, find some. meaning</segment2>
		<segment3>If only this song could capture. The peace you are seeing. If only this song could capture. The hope we are seeking. Everybody finds it necessary. To say how much you loved me. As if I didnt know so deeply</segment3>
		<segment4>Can you see evidence of perfection. Look past the circumstance and find some meaning, find some. meaning</segment4>
		<segment5>Just love me, and let me sleep     </segment5>
