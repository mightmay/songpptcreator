		<segment1>Its fallen x 3. Our world. Its fallen</segment1>
		<segment2>Look, my generation is clueless. Whats all the fuss about. Ignoring Jesus is even ruder than cussing him out. I see no interest at all with true intimacy with Christ. Our apathy is easy to see just like the dots on a dice. We live in a country where worshipping money is all apart of the culture. No worship of God. Just look at they walls. And see who they got on them posters. And see what they got in them holsters. Why cats be holding them choppers?. The Federal Building is filled with killers. That couldve been lawyers and doctors. Now if there is a problem even the young boys. Are fenna get those. Bottles of hypnotic. And cop those cigarellos. Its crazy man cause them ladies now are strapped with a ratchet. We born dead and then we all head back to the casket. See its a wrap for the masses. Cause in Adam something happened. That was traumatic, dramatic, it had to drastic affecting us all. Rejecting our God. Brought death to us all. In choosing to sin. The need to repent. We call it the the fall</segment2>
		<segment3>See, God is communicating to us through the Holy Bible. And the Bible says that God created the Heavens and the earth. Then it says that He created Adam. The first man. Then from Adam He made Eve. And He gave Adam responsibilities in the garden of Eden. But God told Adam. Not to eat at the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But the Bible says that the serpent</segment3>
		<segment4>Was the most cunning creature of them all. And he deceived Eve into eating the fruit of the tree. And then Eve gave to Adam. And thats where sin entered into the world. And because of that. God cursed all of creation and humanity. Now everybody finds themselves in a position. Of a desperate need of a Savior, Jesus Christ. Thats my time yall. Pursue Jesus Christ. Its your boy Flame Peace    </segment4>
