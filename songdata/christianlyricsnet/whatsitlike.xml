		<segment1>In my life all the strife is getting in the way. Frankly I did not plan on getting hurt today. From Your chair in the clouds. Benevolent are Your ways. While the beggar bleeds, the children play. Everyone wants to know why. Isn't it always the question?. How do You know my condition?. You came down to me to know what it's like. To know what it's like to hurt. You came down to me to know what it's like. To know just what it's like to. Be me, to be us. (To be one with the dust and to be lost). (To be one with the dust and to be lost.. to be found)</segment1>
		<segment2>In the wake of the last decades and centuries past. Who's to blame for this mess?. And who's gonna take the rap?. We're quick to judge and discard. A God who lets you choose whom and what to love. Isn't it always the question?. Do You really know my position?</segment2>
		<segment3>You know what it's like to thirst, to bleed. You know what it's like    </segment3>
