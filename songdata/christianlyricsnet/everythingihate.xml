		<segment1>i think i am elastic. these arms they are a wonder. pull from sideways, up and under. i think it's time for something drastic. and it could be more than i bargained for. ten to one it is</segment1>
		<segment2>oh i'm into everything i hate. my spirit is not fooled; my members take the bait. oh i'm in to everything i hate. still not dead enough to stifle this debate</segment2>
		<segment3>these heels were made for bruising. and the cobblestones they're using. are the pleasures of my choosing. i must be born for losing. heal these soles to hurt no more. and i'll lift these hands just like before. Cover me like a dimestore suit. until I'm just like you</segment3>
		<segment4>careful little eyes what you see. careful little feet where you go.    </segment4>
