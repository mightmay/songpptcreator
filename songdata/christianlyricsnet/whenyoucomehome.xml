		<segment1>My first day of recess. They all laughed at me. When I fell off the swing set. And scraped up my knee</segment1>
		<segment2>The nurse called my Momma. To say I'd be late, And when she gave me the phone. I could hear Momma say. &quot;I'm so sorry, son. Oh I think you're' so brave&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>And she was smilin when she said:</segment3>
		<segment4>When you come home, No matter how far, Run through the door. And into my arms. It's where you are loved, It's where you belong. And I will be here. When you come home</segment4>
		<segment5>I waved good-bye through the window. As I boarded the plane, My first job in Houston. Was waiting for me</segment5>
		<segment6>I found a letter from Momma. Tucked in my coat. And as I flew down the runway. I smiled when she wrote: I'll miss you, son, You'll be so far away</segment6>
		<segment7>But I'll be waiting for the day</segment7>
		<segment8>When you come home. No matter how far, Run through the door. And into my arms. It's where you are loved, It's where you belong, And I will be here. When you come home</segment8>
		<segment9>Well, I don't think. She can hear you now, The doctor told me. Your mother is fading, It's best that you leave</segment9>
		<segment10>So I whispered, I love you. And then turned away. But I stopped at the door. When I heard Momma say, I love you, son, But they're callin me away</segment10>
		<segment11>Promise me before I go</segment11>
		<segment12>When you come home, No matter how far, Run through the door. And into my arms;. It's where you are loved, It's where you belong, And I will be here. When you come home, When you come home.    </segment12>
