		<segment1>I didnt come lookin for trouble. And I dont want to fight needlessly. But Im not gonna hide in a bubble. If trouble comes for me. I can feel my heart beating faster. I can tell somethings coming down. But if its gonna make me grow stronger then</segment1>
		<segment2>Bring it on. Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow. Bring it on. Let the trouble come, let the hard rain fall, let it make me strong. Bring it on</segment2>
		<segment3>Now, maybe youre thinkin Im crazy. And maybe I need to explain some things. Cause I know Ive got an enemy waiting. Who wants to bring me pain. But what he never seems to remember. What he means for evil God works for good. So I will not retreat or surrender</segment3>
		<segment4>Now, I dont want to sound like some hero. Cause its God alone that my hope is in. But Im not gonna run from the very things. That would drive me closer to Him. So bring it on</segment4>
		<segment5>Bring it on. Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow. Bring it on. Let the trouble come, let it make me fall on the One whos strong. Bring it on. Let the lightning flash, let the thunder roll, let the storm winds blow. Bring it on. Let me be made weak so Ill know the strength of the One whos strong. Bring it on. Bring it on.     </segment5>
