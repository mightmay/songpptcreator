		<segment1>And the pain falls like a curtain. On the things I once called certain. And I have to say the words I fear the most. I just dont know </segment1>
		<segment2>And the questions without answers. Come and paralyze the dancer. So I stand here on the stage afraid to move. Afraid to fall, oh, but fall I must. On this truth that my life has been formed from the dust </segment2>
		<segment3>God is God and I am not. I can only see a part of the picture Hes painting. God is God and I am man. So Ill never understand it all. For only God is God </segment3>
		<segment4>And the sky begins to thunder. And Im filled with awe and wonder. Til the only burning question that remains. Is who am I </segment4>
		<segment5>Can I form a single mountain. Take the stars in hand and count them. Can I even take a breath without God giving it to me. He is first and last before all that has been. Beyond all that will pass </segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, how great are the riches of His wisdom and knowledge. How unsearchable for to Him and through Him and from Him. are all things </segment6>
		<segment7>So let us worship before the throne. Of the One who is worthy of worship alone.     </segment7>
