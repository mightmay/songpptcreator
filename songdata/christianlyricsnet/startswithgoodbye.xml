		<segment1>I was sitting on my doorstep. Hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand. But i knew i had to do it. And he wouldn't understand</segment1>
		<segment2>So hard to see myself without him. I felt a piece of my heart break. But when you're standing at a crossroad. There's a choice you gotta make</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: i guess it's gonna have to hurt. I guess i'm gonna have to cry. And let go of some things i've loved. To get on to the other side. I guess it's gonna break me down. Like falling when you're trying to fly. It's sad, but moving on with the rest of your life. Starts with goodbye</segment3>
		<segment4>I know there's a blue horizon. Somewhere up ahead just waiting for me. But getting there means leaving things behind. Sometimes life's so bittersweet</segment4>
		<segment5>(Repeat chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Time heals the wounds you feel somehow. But right now</segment6>
		<segment7>(Repeat chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>.     </segment8>
