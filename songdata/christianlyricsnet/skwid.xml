		<segment1>Uh get on with that groove that makes your soul move to this. Oh baby boy. No don't you cry. Oh baby boy. No no don't you cry. Now I know life has it's up and downs. But I saw you from the start and I said you were down. Saw you through the glass we saw two new views. But I know the root's and that's what you'll use. Growing deeper and a deeper and a shadow I see. Rising to an image not like that hollow tree. Rising to an image arising arising arising to. Oh baby boy. No don't you cry. Oh baby boy no don't you cry. Let the rhythm carry you. Let the rhythm breath in you. Let the rhythm flow thought you. Sweet Sweet rhythm. Now we feel the split and my blood well it hurts. but not gonna get you down or make it any worse. Cuz you know and I know what we need has been given. The hopes and strength to talk about our livin'. We're given the and He gave me a write. A praise to sing a gift to bring to extol on high. A seven day miracle that keeps me so hyped y'all. That seven day miracle. Oh baby boy. No don't you cry. Oh baby boy. No don't you cry. Let the rhythm carry you/ let the rhythm breath in you. Let the rhythm flow through you. Sweet Sweet rhythm I love you.     </segment1>
