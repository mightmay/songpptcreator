		<segment1>We The People Hear The Words. That You Are Saying. The Darkness In Our Hearts Remains. We Can Only Live So Long Without The Truth. And The Message You Portray Leaves Me Empty. We Have The Will To Fight. We Just Dont Know Whats Right. Our Hearts Are Crying Out. For Substance To Hold To. Can't You See That We Are Crying. While You're Screaming Our Hearts Are Dying. Shut Your Eyes Shut Your Eyes. Bliss From The Unknown, Hurt We Bear </segment1>
		<segment2>I Want You To Know What I'm Going Through. We Have The Will To Fight. We Just Don't Know What's Right.     </segment2>
