		<segment1>Welcome to the worldwide train wreck. Welcome to the come undone. Welcome to the big rejection. Welcome to the hit and run. Where mercy cries for everyone</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah, nothing is as good as it should be. 'Cause this is the rehearsal. Yeah, in between the was and the could be. Love is the reversal</segment2>
		<segment3>I believe we're underwater. I believe the engine's blown. Yeah I believe our secret longings. Tell us that we're not at home. But grace reclaims what the world disowns    </segment3>
