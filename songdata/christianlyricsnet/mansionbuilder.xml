		<segment1>I've been told that there are those. Who will learn how to fly. And I've been told that there are those. Who will never die. And I've been told that there are stars. That will never lose their shine. And that there is a Morning Star. Who knows my mind </segment1>
		<segment2>So why should I worry?. Why should I fret?. 'Cause I've got a Mansion Builder. Who ain't through with me yet </segment2>
		<segment3>(Repeat) </segment3>
		<segment4>And I've been told that there's a. Crystal lake in the sky. And every tear from my eyes. Is saved when I cry. And I've been told there'll come a time. When the sun will cease to shine. And that there is a Morning Star. Who knows my mind </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus    </segment5>
