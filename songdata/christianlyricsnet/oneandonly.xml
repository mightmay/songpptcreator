		<segment1>Yeah, Yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>Well I am standing in the field. Firmly planted like a tree. And though my roots grow deep, I still sway from side to side. When the wind blows by</segment2>
		<segment3>And this whole world keeps pulling me. But inside I know the truth. No matter what this life can give, I know my heart was made to live for One, It wasn't made for two</segment3>
		<segment4>When you come to me. Questioning priority. Lord, let me drop everything and answer You.</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: Yes Lord, You are, You are, my One and Only (2x). nah nah nah nah nah..</segment5>
		<segment6>It is still hard to believe. That You look past all the flaws in me. You see through the outside part, To the motives of my heart. There is nothing I can't hide</segment6>
		<segment7>So come and take away. Every thought that disobeys. Until my response to You is truthfully. this. (Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>Remind me, Lord. That You are a jealous God. Then my heart will truly say.. (Chorus 2x).     </segment8>
