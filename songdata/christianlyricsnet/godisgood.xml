		<segment1>God is good all the time. God is good all the time. God is good all the time. For unmerited favor I stand up and say. God is good all the time </segment1>
		<segment2>He made a road in the wilderness. I used to be lost but now I'm free. God is good. He would have left His throne in glory. If there was nobody else but me. God is good </segment2>
		<segment3>I used to feel I was all alone. I was looking for peace in my mind. God is good. Then Jesus showed me a better way. That's the reason I testify that. God is good </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm gonna testify. God is good..    </segment4>
