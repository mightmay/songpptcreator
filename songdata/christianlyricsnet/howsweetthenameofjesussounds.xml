		<segment1>How sweet the name of Jesus sounds. In a believer's ear. It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds. And drives away his fear. It makes the wounded spirit whole. And calms the troubled breast. 'Tis manna to the hungry soul. And to the weary, rest. And to the weary, rest</segment1>
		<segment2>Dear name, the Rock on which I build. My shield, and hiding place. My never failing treasury, filled. With boundless stores of grace. Jesus, my Shepherd, Saviour, Friend. My Prophet, Priest, and King. My Lord, my Life, my Way, my End. Accept the praise I bring. Accept the praise I bring</segment2>
		<segment3>Weak is the effort of my heart. And cold my warmest thought. But when I see You as You are. I'll praise You as I ought. I would Your boundless love proclaim. With every fleeting breath. So shall the music of Your name. Refresh my soul in death. Refresh my soul in death</segment3>
