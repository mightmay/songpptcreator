		<segment1>When I was young, the smallest trick of light, Could catch my eye, Then life was new and every new day, I thought that I could fly. I believed in what I hoped for, And I hoped for things unseen, I had wings and dreams could soar, I just don't feel like flying anymore. When the stars threw down their spears, Watered Heaven with their tears, Before words were spoken, Before eternity. </segment1>
		<segment2>Dear Father, I need you, Your strength my heart to mend. I want to fly higher, Every new day again. </segment2>
		<segment3>When I was small, the furthest I could reach, Was not so high, Then I thought the world was so much smaller, Feeling that I could fly. Through distant deeps and skies, Behind infinity, Below the face of Heaven, He stoops to create me. </segment3>
		<segment4>Dear Father, I need you, Your strength my heart to mend. I want to fly higher, Every new day again. </segment4>
		<segment5>Man versus himself. Man versus machine. Man versus the world. Mankind versus me. The struggles go on, The wisdom I lack, The burdens keep pilling. Up on my back. So hard to breathe, To take the next step. The mountain is high, I wait in the depths. Yearning for grace, And hoping for peace. Dear God.. Increase. Healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again. Jesus Christ, light of the world burning bright within our hearts forever. Freedom means love without condition, without a beginning or an end. Here's my heart, let it be forever Your's, Only You can make every new day seem so new.    </segment5>
