		<segment1>There Were Times Before. When I Said That I'd Had Enough. And I Didn't Want To Deal With It, No More. But Now I've Got Something To Say. And I Won't Just Stand By. And Let This Feeling Slowly Fade Away</segment1>
		<segment2>Show Me. That This Can Mean So Much More. Than The Effort That We're Putting In. Show Me. That We Can Try</segment2>
