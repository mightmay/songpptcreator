		<segment1>i said i was sorry and still you said bye turned and walked from the juncture of life dwell on the pain all the memories aside broken heart and hand left out to dry the gap grows wider the table's set no one eats pain to hard to forget i set you aside with no regret here we are not a day passes when i don't think about what we had and now it's gone there's still hope to reconcile time and grace can only mend these broken hearts for the moment in time we side aside what was right we held on to our pride and watched our friendship die letting go has never been so hard it's been so hard the feelings remain i think i've done all I can do to apologize and reach out to you the tables set yet another invitation to forget and begin anew have you forgiven yet or is it too hard to forget.     </segment1>
