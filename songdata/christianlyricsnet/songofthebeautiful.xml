		<segment1>The broken, weary and poor. Finding..You are the cure. The weak and dying, glorifying, You in it all..</segment1>
		<segment2>Its the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me.. Its the song of the beautiful, Jesus Saved Me.. The song of the redeemed, the echoes of those made free, Its the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me..</segment2>
		<segment3>The fallen back on their feet. The fatherless now complete.. The innocent suffering, rising from wounding, to find..You were there all along!</segment3>
		<segment4>Its the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me.. Its the song of the beautiful, Jesus Saved Me.. The song of the redeemed, the echoes of those made free -. Its the song of the beautiful, Jesus Loves Me..</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh how He loves me. Oh how He loves me. Oh how He love me.. The broken, the beautiful..</segment5>
		<segment6>The prodigal running home.. The widow never alone.. The one who is waiting, rising and singing, You..Jesus, You Are My All!    </segment6>
