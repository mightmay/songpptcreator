		<segment1>Only the losers win. They've got nothing to prove. They'll leave the world with nothing to lose </segment1>
		<segment2>You can laugh at the weirdos now. Wait till wrongs are right. They'll be the ones with nothing to hide </segment2>
		<segment3>Cause Ive been thinking, thinking. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a contract pending on eternity. If I haven't already given it away. I've got a plan to lose it all </segment3>
		<segment4>I've been the burnout kid. I've been the idiot. I'll turn the other cheek to be hit </segment4>
		<segment5>You can take what you want from me. Empty me till Im depleted. I'll be around if Im ever needed </segment5>
		<segment6>'Cause I've been thinking, thinking. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a contract pending on eternity. If I haven't already given it away. I've got a plan to lose it all </segment6>
		<segment7>I wrote this song for you. To show how Im selling out. I'll take the benefit of the doubt </segment7>
		<segment8>Because I've been thinking, thinking. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a contract pending on eternity. If I haven't already given it away. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a plan to lose it all. I've got a plan to lose it all.     </segment8>
