		<segment1>I can only imagine that wrath is being held out. So there will be time for us to be redeemed. But surely wrath is not being held out. So that we may redeem ourselves. For I've seen the madness. Of those who died trying. But is regret only a word that the living possess?. I long to see their faces. Regardless of the decay. For in the eyes of the deceased..</segment1>
		<segment2>We would see hope in our last day. Inside this dying world. For there is still beauty. Inside this dying world    </segment2>
