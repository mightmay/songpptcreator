		<segment1>Now listen there's something much better. Than what I had and what I had been told. And now one day I heard a message spoken, Forever in my heart the words I hold</segment1>
		<segment2>The Healer said there is only one river. The river of life, filled with faith and love. It's flowing from the sacrifice of Jesus, and. Brings us all into the Kingdom of God.</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: So I'm going down, to drown myself today. Nothin left to live for, nothin in my way</segment3>
		<segment4>Hold me underwater, take me even farther. Drown me down by the river today. Will you make me a believer?. Take me by my hand, hold me as I'm falling in, Cleanse me and wash my sins</segment4>
		<segment5>So here I am at the edge of the water. That separates me from my death and life. and still I come here with unanswered questions. But that's not gonna to make me change my mind    </segment5>
