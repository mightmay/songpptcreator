		<segment1>His love. He is King. He is with us. He is God. He is with us. He is God (Not a clue). In refuge and strength. Ever present help in trouble. Without fear. As the nations uproar. And the kingdoms fall. He lifts. His voice melting. He is with us. He is God. He is with us. He is God. In His purpose. I will stand. I've been renewed by Him alone. We've been made by the Maker. Bought by the Buyer Broken. by the Breaker. I am His. (x2)     </segment1>
