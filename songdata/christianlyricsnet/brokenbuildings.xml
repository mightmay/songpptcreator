		<segment1>Saturate my mind with memories. Of the Only One Who ever loved me. Everything in time will fade away. Its left me here in broken buildings </segment1>
		<segment2>Ill never know what You see in me </segment2>
		<segment3>What did You see in me, what do You see in me?. Is there beauty in these broken buildings?. What did You see in me, what do You see in me?. You found beauty in these broken buildings </segment3>
		<segment4>Moments of regret used to be. The thoughts that often times consumed me. As shadows hid the eyes that said it all. Its left me here in broken buildings </segment4>
		<segment5>And how could I repay the priceless gift You gave?. Ill never understand why You would take my place. You saw me at my worst, and still, You never left. Even when my world came crashing down.     </segment5>
