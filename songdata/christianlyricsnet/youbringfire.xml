		<segment1>I feel a deep meaning in my soul, I dont know whats happening, I cant let this go. And I, oh I am losing control, Ive tried to run away but,</segment1>
		<segment2>You bring fire, To my bitter and drafty. Soul, its time, I chose your light as my own.</segment2>
		<segment3>You alone can bring me to my knees, Where I can exchange my worries, For the peace beyond all understanding, You know what I mean.</segment3>
		<segment4>And I, oh I am losing control, Ive tried to run away but, You bring fire, To my bitter and drafty. Soul, its time, I chose your light as my own.</segment4>
		<segment5>You bring fire, To my cold soul.</segment5>
		<segment6>Keep your love so close, Until youve felt it in your heart, Everyone I call, The sound of him is trapped inside,</segment6>
		<segment7>Trapped inside, oh woah.</segment7>
		<segment8>You bring fire, To my bitter and drafty. Soul, its time, I chose your light as my own.</segment8>
		<segment9>You bring fire, To my bitter and drafty. Soul, its time, I chose your light as my own    </segment9>
