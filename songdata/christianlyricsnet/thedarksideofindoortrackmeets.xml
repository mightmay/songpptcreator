		<segment1>Such fluorescent, you must wonder how I sleep. Shaking spells end, as the cuts lined up my knees</segment1>
		<segment2>I guess I'm weightless as I tape my eyelids up. But now I wonder that I may have ran too far</segment2>
		<segment3>Watch me float by, a bending, arched and sweeping sight. Now play it backwards, and I swear you will see me misty-eyed</segment3>
		<segment4>If there's complications, pull the plug out. Pull the plug out    </segment4>
