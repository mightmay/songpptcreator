		<segment1>I spent my life. Learning to survive. Walked down these roads. Hoping each one might lead me home</segment1>
		<segment2>I learned early on. That trust can come undone. And leave your heart. Guarding it's deepest part</segment2>
		<segment3>But you got in through the marrow and bone. Shed some light where none had shone</segment3>
		<segment4>I lost i found. I was missing love missing love. I fought to stand my ground. I was missing love oh missing love</segment4>
		<segment5>Can you teach me. To live as one who's free. From fear and from shame. And the lie that i'll never change</segment5>
		<segment6>Help me to see myself through a lovers eyes. No more mask no disguise</segment6>
		<segment7>I lost i found. I was missing love missing love. I fought to stand my ground. I was missing love oh missing love</segment7>
		<segment8>You found me and made me whole again. My Savior my Friend</segment8>
		<segment9>I lost i found. I was missing love missing love. I fought to stand my ground. I was missing love oh missing love.     </segment9>
