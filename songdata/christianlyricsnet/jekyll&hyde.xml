		<segment1>by Bob Hartman. Based on Rom. 7:15</segment1>
		<segment2>I have a secret that I let nobody see. An evil shadow that's been hanging over me. My alter ego that I try to hold at bay. But despite my good intentions he can always get away </segment2>
		<segment3>He does the things that I don't want to do </segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde. Two men are fighting a war inside </segment4>
		<segment5>I have this secret that I let nobody see. It's like a split personality. And the one I feed is the one who lives. The one I starve will be the one who gives </segment5>
		<segment6>He won't do things that I know I should do </segment6>
		<segment7>Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde. Two men are fighting a war inside. One gives, one takes, I have to decide. Sometimes I feel like Jekyll and Hyde </segment7>
		<segment8>I need somebody to rescue me. When personalities clash. I know which person I want to be. With no defiance. Just God-reliance     </segment8>
