		<segment1>I could tell you a story of shame. I could talk for hours on how we became. a flower that bloomed in one day. The next day our glory faded away. Divided by hostilities, hung up on issues, we disagree. A body that's been torn apart. We're still a body with a healthy heart.</segment1>
		<segment2>People like me, persons like you. We want to be, closer to God. Closer to free. All you people like me.</segment2>
		<segment3>What do you think when you see. continuous losers the people like me?. I hope you never believe. just for a moment you're better than me. The truth is that we are the same. All different people but only one name. I hope that you will agree. that all of you are people like me.</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't stand by myself anymore. I forgot what we're fighting for. Please come take my hand. we can make our stand. feels so good to be, be so free.    </segment4>
