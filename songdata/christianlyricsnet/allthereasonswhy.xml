		<segment1>Well we're thrown out on a stage. To find our paths to yesterday. When the world was so much smaller. And we were free, free to be</segment1>
		<segment2>Well we all moved to the big town. And we all put on the big sound. Truly what would we sing for. If it wasn't for Your Grace</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS</segment3>
		<segment4>And we sing 'cause You are bigger. Than any reference we could make. And we dance until we're tired. 'Cause we know Your name is great</segment4>
		<segment5>On our journey give us Grace. As we follow lines Your hand will trace. You have called us to a crown. But for a time, to taste the ground. Give us edge by ones You love. Shrewd as snakes and harmless as doves. Songs will always find their endings. But Your story never dies, that's why</segment5>
		<segment6>And we sing 'cause You are bigger. Than any reference we could make. And we dance until we're tired. 'Cause we know Your name is great</segment6>
		<segment7>And we sing 'cause You are bigger. Than any reference we could make. And we dance until we're tired. 'Cause we know Your name is great    </segment7>
