		<segment1>I've worked hard. and I'm ready for a long vacation. got some money in my pocket. and I'm going down to the station. saw a poster on a wall. and the place looked really nice. a man with a beard said &quot;follow me. I'll take you to paradise&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>If you want to come with me there's room. there are no legal limits. there's always room for one more soul. so why not come and get it </segment2>
		<segment3>I want to ride this train to Gloryland. so why don't you come up here. and join the band? </segment3>
		<segment4>Met the man with the beard. halfway through Kentucky. He walked with me and he talked with me. some people say I'm lucky. for that day the man I met payed the full price. now I ride the train for free. the train to Paradise     </segment4>
