		<segment1>Remember what its like to me you?. To be you. Remember what its like to be me?. To be me. All that I see these eyes in my dreams. These thought police coming for me</segment1>
		<segment2>Do you know what it means. What it means to be free. Do you know what it means. To be free? (me). Neither do I. Neither do we</segment2>
		<segment3>Do you know what its like to be one. One of us. Do you know what its like to be one. One of us. One is the family perfect in apathy. Being a clone isn't all that it promised to be</segment3>
		<segment4>I am invisible just like you. Just a reflection of what I consume. Now I myself will be consumed. Consumed for the sake of you    </segment4>
