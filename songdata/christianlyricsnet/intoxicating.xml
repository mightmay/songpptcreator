		<segment1>Intoxicating You are to me. Illuminating You are to see. Truly breathtaking You are to breathe. Sending my head spinning You are, You see</segment1>
		<segment2>And I've lost my mind, I'm sure to find. Need to apologize for my. Lack of inhibition, for my belligerent condition. But with You this near I'm dizzy</segment2>
		<segment3>Inebriating You are to me. Completely captivating You are yo see. Sending my world spinning You are, You see</segment3>
		<segment4>And now I find a blurry line. Here between You and I. Raise the cup, drink 'til I'm full. Sing 'til I can't, 'til my voice is gone. And my head is spinning </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: La, la dee da. La dee da, dee da. Dee da da da. Hey la, la dee da. La dee da, dee da. Dee da da da</segment5>
		<segment6>Illuminating You are to see. Truly breathtaking You are to breathe. Sending my head spinning You are, You see</segment6>
		<segment7>And now I find a blurry line. Here between you and I. Raise the cup, drink 'til I'm full. Sing 'til I can't, 'til my voice is gone. And my head is spinning dizzy</segment7>
		<segment8>If I'm out of my mind it's You, You. 'Cause I'm crazy in love with You, You. Inebriated by You, You. 'Cause I'm head over heels with You, You    </segment8>
