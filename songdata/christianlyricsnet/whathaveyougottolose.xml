		<segment1>Sin and shame, guilt and pain, pride and your conceit. Here and now, lay them down at the Saviors feet. What have you got to lose, what have you got to lose. And tell me why youre so afraid, What have you got to lose, what have you got to lose. Think of all you have to gain. Hope and dreams and all the things that you have ever made. It dont mean much if in the end you have lost your way. Let go of all you know only then can life be found. Surrender all you hold. Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down!    </segment1>
