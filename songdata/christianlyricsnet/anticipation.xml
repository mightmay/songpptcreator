		<segment1>This anticipation. Seen in you. As you prepare for new life. Don't forget your war. The cuts on his hands, speak a little louder. He takes that side, and lets you know. And what's in his speech, hands cover face</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah what's in his, you cover your face. (3x). Now you're anticipating</segment2>
		<segment3>What went wrong. In this world we fall back into. Just isn't strong. The cuts on his hands, made way to his face. These spoke all the louder, my silent regret. I show that side, the pride of life. Won't let go    </segment3>
