		<segment1>You cannot break me, how far this takes me. My mind is racing as I play this song. Will you walkout?. This song is played out. This thing I'm facing will not go quietly. Place to place, I see you face, keep me centered now. Need some sleep, your song I keep deep within my heart. Tomorrow's at stake, but this show won't make my love wander from my promises. I feel better now, and I will carry this song until we are done. Home now, nothing's better. With you forever, it doesn't seem long enough.    </segment1>
