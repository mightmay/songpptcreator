		<segment1>Taste and see that the Lord is good; taste and see, taste and see. Blessed is the man who trusts in him; blessed is he, blessed is he. </segment1>
		<segment2>The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him. Taste and see that the Lord is good; taste and see, taste and see. I sought the Lord, and he answered me; taste and see, taste and see. From all my fears, he delivered me; blessed is he, blessed is he. The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him. Taste and see that the Lord is good; taste and see taste and see.    </segment2>
