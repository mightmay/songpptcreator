		<segment1>. On Jordan's stormy banks I stand. And cast a wishful eye. To Canaan's fair and happy land. Where my possessions lie</segment1>
		<segment2>All o'er those wide extended plains. Shines one eternal day. There God, the Son forever reigns. And scatters night away.</segment2>
		<segment3>I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land</segment3>
		<segment4>No chilling wind nor poisonous breath. Can reach that healthful shore. Where sickness, sorrow, pain and death. Are felt and feared no more</segment4>
		<segment5>I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land</segment5>
		<segment6>When shall I see that happy place. And be forever blessed. When shall I see my Father's face. And in His bosom rest</segment6>
		<segment7>I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land. I am bound, I am bound, I am bound for the Promise Land    </segment7>
