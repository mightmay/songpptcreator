		<segment1>Defender of this heart. You loved me from the start, You never change. Through the highs and lows. As seasons come and go, You never fail. Day after day, Your love will remain. Faithful and true, You are good</segment1>
		<segment2>You are God with us. You're victorious. You are strong and mighty to save. For Your word stands true. There is none like You. And when all else fades You remain</segment2>
		<segment3>When troubles come my way. You guide and You sustain, lead me I pray. Forever You will be the Great Eternal King. Now and always    </segment3>
