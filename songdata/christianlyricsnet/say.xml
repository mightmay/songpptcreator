		<segment1>Let me go back. And do it all over again. What i know now. I wish i knew then. There's a pain. That just will not die</segment1>
		<segment2>Let me hear you say it's okay. Let me hear you say it's alright. I could really use some words of comfort. So i won't be alone tonight. So i won't be alone tonight</segment2>
		<segment3>Let me move on. I've said I was sorry. Help me look out. And see the sun again. 'Cause there's a pain. That somehow must die    </segment3>
