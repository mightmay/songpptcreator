		<segment1>In photographs we define ourselves. Beneath the blanket of fashion. The things we fear the most. Are caught by our eyes in a mirror. We will decompose</segment1>
		<segment2>Until we have faces. Identity abides. In what we claim is the truth, Till fact and faith collide</segment2>
		<segment3>Until we have faces. My heart is set on you. But time and time again, My eyes believe in lies.</segment3>
		<segment4>To desire and dread. A war we can't explain. One fights to remember. Another to forget himself. A face we own forever, But our heart can always change.    </segment4>
