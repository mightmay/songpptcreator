		<segment1>The snakes are in the garden, swallowing down their prey. The flowers all are faded, their scent has gone away. The sky turns red under midnight, your eyes don't look the same. The truth is out; I can see your heavy breathing. The lights are down and you're moving out in the dark. So kiss my face, commit yourself to treason. Now run away, you broke my heart. The hours are now turning, nobody lies awake. The children all are sleeping, a lonely death dirge plays. The ropes pulls tight under your weight, the nightmare ends today. You broke my heart. I hope it's worth the price you paid. I hope it's worth the time you gave. I hope it's worth your life    </segment1>
