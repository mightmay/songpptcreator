		<segment1>Oh..I can be nice, but don't test me.  I can get wicked,  I get wicked,  Wicked,  I get wicked,  Theres no escaping it,  Wicked,  You wanna kick it,  Watch me get wicked, step up and get it cause I get wicked </segment1>
		<segment2> Im a beast, came to rip this spot up,  Stick to calls cause the devil wears Prada.  We want peace but we can make this rowdy.  Stop.  We don't wanna hurt nobody.  You can't hang me cause my nature's nice.  and my hearts for the people of the world tonight.  If you got a problem with it take it up with life.  Cause if you try to push me it ain't gonna be nice </segment2>

		<segment4> I am not afraid of this mountain in my way.  It can push me to my knees, I believe </segment4>
		<segment5> And I am now awake, uncontrolled and unashamed.  When it washes over me, I feel free </segment5>
		<segment6> P.S. don't play me like a 3DS.  These cats can't see us they're checking the wrong mirrors, Cavaliers.  Dont mistake kindness for weakness.  They never wanted to hear us, blown speakers.  Spitting the trinity, hook line and sequence.  In your brain, like a G6, no secrets.  My Faith's my life, but's rollin the dice.  If you try to push me it ain't gonna be nice </segment6>

		<segment10> Go! </segment10>
		<segment11> Oh..I can be nice, don't test me.  I get wicked,  Wicked,  I get wicked,  Theres no escaping it,  Wicked,  You wanna kick it,  Watch me get wicked, step up and get it cause I get.  I get wicked when you come against me.  So, quit it, stop trying to push me around,  Lets kick it,  If you really wanna touch fire, come get it,  Step up, I'll bring you down </segment11>
