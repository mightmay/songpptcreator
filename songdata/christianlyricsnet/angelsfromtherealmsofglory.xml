		<segment1>Angels from the realms of glory, Wing your flight o'er all the earth;. Ye who sang creation's story. Now proclaim Messiah's birth</segment1>
		<segment2>Shepherds, in the field abiding, Watching o'er your flocks by night, God with us is now residing;. Yonder shines the infant light</segment2>
		<segment3>Come and worship, come and worship, Come and worship, Christ the newborn king. Come and worship, come and worship, Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.</segment3>
		<segment4>Sinners, wrung with true repentance, Doomed for guilt to endless pains, Justice now revokes the sentence, Mercy calls you, break your chains</segment4>
		<segment5>Come and worship, come and worship, Come and worship, Christ the newborn king. Come and worship, come and worship, Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.</segment5>
		<segment6>Though an Infant now we view Him, He shall fill His Father's throne, Gather all the nations to Him;. Every knee shall then bow down:</segment6>
		<segment7>All creation, join in praising. God, the Father, Spirit, Son, Evermore your voices raising. To th'eternal Three in One.</segment7>
		<segment8>Come and worship, come and worship, Come and worship, Christ the newborn king. Come and worship, come and worship, Come and worship, Christ the newborn king.     </segment8>
