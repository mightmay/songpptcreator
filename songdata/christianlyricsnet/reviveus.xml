		<segment1>Ready or not. Change is comin'. Can you feel the spirit rising in you. Has it been a while. Since you felt the fire and passion and joy anew</segment1>
		<segment2>Are you ready for a revelation. We all know that there is so much more. We're in need of this inspiration. Can't wait another day. I gotta have it right away</segment2>
		<segment3>*chorus*. Revive us again. Revive us again. Restore the joy of our salvation. Revive us again. Revive us again. Renew life within. Revive us again</segment3>
		<segment4>Love is alive and exciting. If we only let it take control. Drink from the fountain. It's so inviting. It will strengthen and refresh us all</segment4>
		<segment5>Nothing can stop this revolution. When we're determined to see it through. If we believe that there is one solution. You know his name is Jesus. He is the one to free us</segment5>
