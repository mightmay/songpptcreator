		<segment1>Lord, the feelings are not the same. I guess I'm older. I guess I've changed. And how I wish it had been explained. That as you're growing. You Must remember. That nothin' lasts except the grace of God. By which I stand in Jesus. I know that I would surely fall away. Except for the grace by which I'm saved</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, I remember that special way. I vowed to serve you. When it was brand new. But like Peter I can't even watch and pray. One hour with you. And I bet I could deny you too</segment2>
		<segment3>Well nothin' lasts except the grace of God. By which I stand in Jesus. I know that I would surely fall away. Except for Grace by which I'm saved</segment3>
		<segment4>Well nothin' lasts except the grace of God. By which I stand in Jesus. I'm sure that my whole life would waste away. Except for grace by which I'm saved    </segment4>
