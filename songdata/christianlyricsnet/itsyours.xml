		<segment2>So it's yours it's yours. My life is yours it's yours. So come on and have your way in me </segment2>
		<segment3>Save to lose in this economy upside down. Lose to find the only life worth living for. Give to gain I want to lead a life that's full of love. Help me see outside of me the strength in giving away </segment3>
		<segment4>So it's yours it's yours. My life is yours it's yours. My life is yours it's yours. My life is yours it's yours </segment4>
		<segment5>So come on and have your way in me. Come on and have your way in me </segment5>
