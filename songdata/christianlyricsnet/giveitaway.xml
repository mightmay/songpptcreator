		<segment1>She asked him for forever. And a promise that would last. He said, babe, you know I love you. But I can't commit to that. She said love isn't love. 'til you give it away. A father lived in silence. Saw his son become a man. There was a distance felt between them. 'cause he could not understand. That love isn't love. 'til you give it away. You gotta give it away</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: As we live. Moving side by side. May we learn to give. Learn to sacrifice</segment2>
		<segment3>We can entertain compassion. For a world in need of care. But the road of good intentions. Doesn't lead to anywhere. 'cause love isn't love. 'til you give it away. You gotta give it away</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). Love is like a river. Flowing down from the giver of life. We drink from the water. And our thirst is no longer denied. You gotta give it away</segment4>
		<segment5>There was a man who walked on water. He came to set the people free. He was the ultimate example. Of what love can truly be. 'cause his love was his life. And he gave it away. You gotta give it away</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
