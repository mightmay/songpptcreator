		<segment1>Now this is who we are. I am no one's hero. For we are not the giant men. That some may think. You are faithful when we are not. So I'd like to tell this story. The way it is meant to be. Without the burden that's in our hearts. None of us would have ever found You. For You are faithful when we are not. You began a work. That only you can complete</segment1>
		<segment2>Now this is who we are. I'll never know the answers. And I'll always wonder why</segment2>
		<segment3>..Why we're given grace we'll never deserve. And a second chance that we will never earn. For there is nothing I can do to save myself</segment3>
		<segment4>Now this is who we are. I'll never know the answers. And I'll always wonder why. But You have let me start again. I'd rather be called weak. Than die thinking I was strong.     </segment4>
