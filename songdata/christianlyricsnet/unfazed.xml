		<segment1>I don't think. You had in mind When You set my city on a hill. For it's walls to be built up to keep the light in. Brick on brick I'm building still. But the moon still shines. The stars seem brighter I see You through the haze. So I remain unfazed</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't think You were intending. When You pitched this tent You call Your home. For it to be a place always in need of mending. With a bed as cold as stone. My roof caved in, the weight of unbelief and. My eyes half closed, my vision getting weak and. Still I see You I know You'll never fade. So I am not afraid.    </segment2>
