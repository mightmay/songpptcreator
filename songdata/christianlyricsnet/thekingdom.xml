		<segment1>So near and yet still so far, far away. So close, and yet still to come. Concealed, the seed is mysteriously growing. In hearts that will listen and hear. A treasure that's hidden, a pearl of great price. A fortune for fools who believe</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). A kingdom of beauty, a kingdom of love. A kingdom of justice of justice and peace. A kingdom that holds all the wilds of creation. A kingdom where children will lead</segment2>
		<segment3>For now this kingdom's a land of the lowly. A place for the tired, plundered poor. Now our gentle King comes in peace on a donkey. But then on a charger for war. A battle in heaven, a war on the earth. To shatter the long darkened siege</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Not by our own strength. And not by power of might. But by His Spirit it comes. Blinded eyes will see. And deafened ears will hear. The praise from the lips of the dumb</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
