		<segment1>[chorus]. it's high school could be. a mini me of the rest of society. there's always a prom queen. there'll always be, always be sororities. but sadly some will be. eternally keeping score for popularity. and just 'coz they all do. doesn't mean we have to act like we're in high school. doesn't mean we have to act like we're in high school </segment1>
		<segment2>High school is like a big competiton. beauty contest prom court is the mission. there can only be one queen one king. everyone voting everyone competing. but these are the rules the way of high school. if someone puts you down, thats so high school. someone talks behind your back thats so high school. thinking you have to get them back thats also high school. i know i'll be graduating early. [chorus] </segment2>
		<segment3>High school is like the state of the nation. some people never change after graduation. believing any light you shine makes theirs lesser. they have to prove to everyone that theirs is better. these are the rules the ways of high school. if someone puts you down that's so high school. believing their too cool for you that's so high school. if you believe it too that's also high school. i know i'll be graduating early. [chorus] </segment3>
		<segment4>we've all got bad yearbook photos. which we've forgot to let go. and just like acne our insecurity. should be something left with the jv. so here's to letting go of yearbook photos. things we kept that hold us down so. that was yesterday there's always tomorrow. we are tomorrow we are tomorrow. so i know I'll be graduating early. [chorus].     </segment4>
