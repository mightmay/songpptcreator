		<segment1>Because a machine. Could burn the life out of me. Not the same when I try. It's just a bad lullaby</segment1>
		<segment2>When I learn to sing. I'll change the key of everything. When I learn to read. I'll change my ways on everything</segment2>
		<segment3>You know the worries. Just the things I sing about me. Not the same when I try. It's just a bad lullaby</segment3>
		<segment4>When I learn to sing. I'll change the key of everything. When I learn to read. I'll change my ways on everything    </segment4>
