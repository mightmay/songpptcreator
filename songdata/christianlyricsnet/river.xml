		<segment1>When the mountains fall, when the stars collide. I know You'll be there, standing by my side. When the river runs, overflows the seas. I know You'll be there, and You will still be loving me</segment1>
		<segment2>It's hard to see that, hard to believe that. O once was all on my own. Cause You've been faithful, and I'm so grateful. That You never left me alone. (Ooh it's so good to know) To know that You are with. Me all of the time. (You'll never let me go) And I am. walking with You to stay alive</segment2>
		<segment3>Some try to tell me, that there's another. Something that fulfills like You do. But I'm not leaving there's nothing out there. Not a thing more precious than You. (I have no need to fear) My Father watches over. Me night and day. (My choice is very clear) I'm so delighted to be. Walking Your way</segment3>
		<segment4>I never have to worry, I never have to fear. Cause You are always near taking good care of me. I never have to worry, I never have to fear. Cause You are always near and You will still be. Loving me    </segment4>
