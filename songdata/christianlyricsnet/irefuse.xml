		<segment1>Sometimes I, I just wanna close my eyes. And act like everyone's alright. well no they're not. This world needs God, but it's easier to stand and watch. I could say a prayer and just move on. like nothin's wrong. But I refuse.  cause I don't wanna live like I don't care.  I don't wanna say another empty prayer. Oh I refuse, to sit  around and wait for someone else. To do what God has called me to do myself. Oh I could choose not to move. but I refuse. I can hear the least of these. cryin' out so desperately. and I know we are the hands and feet of You oh God. So if You say move. it's time for me to follow through. and do what I was made to do. and show them who You are. Cause I don't wanna live like I don't care. I don't wanna say another empty prayer. Oh I refuse to sit around. and wait for someone else. to do what God has called me to do myself. Oh I could choose. not to move. but I refuse. to stand and whatch the weary and lost. cry out for help. I refuse. to turn my back. and try and act like all is well. I refuse. to stay and change. to wait another day. to die to myself. I refuse. to make one more excuse. cause I don't wanna live like I don't care. I don't wanna say another empty prayer. Oh I refuse. to sit around and wait for someone else. to do what God has called me to do myself. oh I could choose. not to move. but I refuse. I refuse. I refuse. yeah    </segment1>
