		<segment1>Someone please turn the lights back on. I've been wandering here for days, disconnected, and in search. For new air to breathe in</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't think I can fix this. Don't think I could change</segment2>
		<segment3>But that's the problem. We never speak to Him. Our walls have caged us in. And I can't quite remember</segment3>
		<segment4>This was the first time I didn't say enough. This was the only time I kept it close enough</segment4>
		<segment5>Brace yourself! They're not waking up</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, my God. I hate the me that I've become. This needy useless forgetting one. Truthfully I can't be the me that I've washed up to be</segment6>
		<segment7>Don't stop breathing. The walls have just begun to spin. Just let the water calm you this time. It's all around you, just open your eyes and take a look. It will never kill you; not this time</segment7>
		<segment8>It's all around you. We're surrounded for all I care</segment8>
		<segment9>Brace yourself right now. Lights out I'm not breathing. I can't keep swimming, can't keep my head up.     </segment9>
