		<segment1>Oh my Father. I come in Your name and with tears. I ask for You to. Expose all my faults, rid me of myself. And my needs to fulfill my flesh. Break me and my concieted heart. Let light shine out of the darkness. And have glory through my weakness. Appear in the death of my sin. Let Your fire burn the evil that eats my mind. Kill my darkness. I will fail at everything by myself. I will fail in Your eyes and my own. Without Your hand to guide me on my path. For without You Lord I will fall astray. I need You Lord, Your Spirit, Your strength. For when I am weak, then I am strong.    </segment1>
