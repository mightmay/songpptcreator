		<segment1>There's a card up my sleeve, it's a quicker solution and it's easier than honesty. There's a look on your face, like you've just seen a murder and you're terrified beyond belief. You think you figured this out, with the lights all down low and a stare that will chill the bone. Like a halfway house, empty your pockets unload all your failures.</segment1>
		<segment2>Walk away like nothing happened. whispering 'it's gonna make sense in the end.. It's now or never are we ever gonna get this right?. It's now or never are we ever gonna get this right? Cover up those fair intentions, after this we will never be the same again. It's now or never are we ever gonna get this right?</segment2>
		<segment3>Like an avalanche I will bring you to your knees, and the pressure will break your bones, silencing your screams. </segment3>
		<segment4>What can wash away my sins?. Nothing but the blood. Blood for blood.     </segment4>
