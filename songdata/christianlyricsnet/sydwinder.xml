		<segment1>I'm always filling my mind. with all this porno lit, treat the. woman I love like a degenerate, I got to give it up. I'm getting sick of it. Sydwinder, It's on the ground. Sydwinder, It comes unwound. Sydwinder, It's all around. Sydwinder, It's on the ground. I'm always telling my mind. I got to get it right, I'm always. telling my mind i got to get it right. I'm always telling my mind I got to get it right. Their always telling my mind I got to get it right. Their always telling my mind I got to get it right. Their always telling my mind I got to get it right. You're raping my mind.    </segment1>
