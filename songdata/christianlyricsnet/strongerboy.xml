		<segment1>i was caught up in a sandbar. For the tide had not come in. And the ship was all but grounded here. Waiting to begin. . There's a trick to understanding. What it is you couldn't see. And a map without a compass. Is impossible to read. . Lights out a pillowcase to cry on. A good friend to rely on for a prayer. Oh please be careful my brother. The fighting will never be fair. . Oh it can only make me stronger. Cast the weight away. Oh stronger and stronger. Sail away away. . The pathway to the future. Is always straight ahead. So i took off in that direction. Just to see where it led. . . The weather's nice in florida. When you come from the mid-west. But pretty soon it turned to desert. And it's sure been a test. . Take heart behind the bathroom door. A good shoulder to cry on unaware. But don't forget that a kick in the face. Is for some daily fare. . Oh it can only make me stronger. Cast the weight away. Oh stronger and stronger. Sail away away. . And it's struggle that i can't escape. But it's something i can run to hey hey hey. . Oh it can only make me stronger. Cast the weight away. Oh stronger and stronger. Sail away away    </segment1>
