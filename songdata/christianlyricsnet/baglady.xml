		<segment1>Flea bitten bag lady. once you looked fine. you had a family you loved. just like mine. Second hand clothing. and knots in your hair. Tonight you might die. but would anyone care. Sweet little lady you soul is worth gold. don't believe all the lies you've been told. I've got a friend a friend indeed. who comes to the rescue of damsels in need </segment1>
		<segment2>Friend and Father repair their souls. make them feel wanted. make them feel whole. Friend and Father repair their souls. make them feel wanted. make them feel whole </segment2>
		<segment3>Young daddy's daughter with child on the way. made a mistake but that's okay. life is the most precious gift of them all. Just cry on my shoulder and I'll give a call     </segment3>
