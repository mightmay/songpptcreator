		<segment1>Jesus You're all I need. You're all I need. Now I give my life to You alone. You are all I need. Jesus You're all I need. You're all I need. Lord You gave Yourself. So I could live. You are all I need. Oh you purchased my salvation. And wiped away my tears. Now I drink Your living water. And I'll never thirst again. For You alone are Holy. I'll worship at Your throne. And You will reign forever. Holy is the Lord    </segment1>
