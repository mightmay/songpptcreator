		<segment1>you send us out as lambs amongst the wolves. but the Lion stands by our side. you will be my guide. i need you to lead me. i am so weak without you. i'm tired of fighting. i need you to fight for me. you will be my guide. Jesus. your voice is so sweet to my ears. Jesus. i desire to be close to you. fill me with your Spirit God. you've given me a sword to kill my enemies. Father, take these struggles from me.     </segment1>
