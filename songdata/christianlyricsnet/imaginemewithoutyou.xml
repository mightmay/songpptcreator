		<segment1>As long as stars shine down from heaven. And the rivers run into the sea. Til the end of time forever. You're the only love I'll need</segment1>
		<segment2>In my life you're all that matters. In my eyes the only truth I see. When my hopes and dreams have shattered. You're the one that's there for me</segment2>
		<segment3>When I found you I was blessed. And I will never leave you, I need you</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: Imagine me without you. I'd be lost and so confused. I wouldn't last a day, I'd be afraid. Without you there to see me through</segment4>
		<segment5>Imagine me without you. Lord, you know it's just impossible. Because of you, it's all brand new. My life is now worthwhile. I can't imagine me without you</segment5>
		<segment6>When you caught me I was falling. You're love lifted me back on my feet. It was like you heard me calling. And you rush to set me free</segment6>
		<segment7>When I found you I was blessed. And I will never leave you, I need you</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>When I found you I was blessed. And I will never leave you, I need you oh</segment9>
		<segment10>Chorus</segment10>
		<segment11>I can't imagine me without you    </segment11>
