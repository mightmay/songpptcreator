		<segment1>Armfull of Dreams </segment1>
		<segment2>I wish I could wake up each morning. With an armfull of dreams that came true. I could share them with so many people. But most of all I would share them with you</segment2>
		<segment3>You're the reason I sing in the evening. In my room all alone I hear Your call. As You inspire me with wisdom through music. With a message I can share with one and all</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus, Jesus takes all my sorrows away. I just realized with Him in my life. My arms are already full everyday</segment4>
		<segment5>Make sure that you pray for the right things. The things that are pleasing to Him. After all He has promised you heaven. A place you can live without sin.     </segment5>
