		<segment1>So much deeper than the oceans is the heart of man. So much higher than the mountains. Are the things that I dont understand. Like why Im crying over someone who will never give a damn</segment1>
		<segment2>We have boarded up the basement for the storm has found its prey. I have bottled my emotions and saved them for a rainy day. Now Ill drink the bitter poison of a love thats been delayed</segment2>
		<segment3>Since Youve been gone, I cant fight it I cant fight it. Ive tried for too long I cant hide it I cant hide it anymore</segment3>
		<segment4>This has called for desperate measures. We have left our pride behind. We are aging with the hours of this superficial life. And I refuse to be a failure, I have to give it one more try</segment4>
		<segment5>But I doubt that you are listening and I doubt that you are moved. I have doubted every step along this long and darkened journey. But I have never doubted you. Now the longing has awoken and I dont know what to do     </segment5>
