		<segment3>A pledge allegiance to a country without borders, without politicians. Watching for my sky to get torn apart. We are broken, we are bitter. We're the problem, we're the politicians. Watching for our sky to get torn apart. C'mon and break me</segment3>

		<segment5>A pledge allegiance to a country without borders, without politicians. Watching for my sky to get torn apart. We are broken, we are bitter. We're the problem, we're the politicians. Watching for our sky to get torn apart. C'mon and break me. C'mon and break me</segment5>
		<segment6>A pledge allegiance to a country without borders, without politicians, politicians, politicians.</segment6>
