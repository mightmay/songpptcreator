		<segment1>The terminal leaves behind. Half-smiles and drying eyes. With ticket clutched in hand. I long to find my way back home. But even from way up here. The view isn't all that clear. What good is this perspective. If I can't tell where to go?. I can't tell where to go</segment1>
		<segment2>You're looking down on me. Lost and incomplete. Desperate to make things. The way I think they ought to be. But You've got a different way. You've seen all my mistakes. You're asking me to leave the pieces where they lay. You take my hand, we turn and walk away</segment2>
		<segment3>The turbulence shakes the room. The passengers and the crew. With armrest clutched in hand. I long to regain some control. But as I relax my grip. I realize the truth of it. I'm just as powerless when. I am on the ground below. And I can't tell where to go</segment3>
		<segment4>You're looking down on me. Lost and incomplete. Desperate to make things. The way I think they ought to be. But You've got a different way. You've seen all my mistakes. You're asking me to leave the pieces where they lay. You take my hand, we turn and walk away</segment4>
		<segment5>We turn and walk away. We turn and walk away. The terminal leaves behind (We turn and walk away). Half-smiles and drying eyes (We turn and walk away). But as I relax my grip (We turn and walk away). I realize the truth of it (We turn and walk away). I can't tell where to go (We turn and walk away). The terminal leaves behind (We turn and walk away). Half-smiles and drying eyes (We turn and walk away). We turn and walk away    </segment5>
