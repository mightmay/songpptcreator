		<segment1>Run away, run away, from the many things, that take this heart away from you. Let's leave the time, leave the time, and race to the dawns where I'll finally. want the sunlight to call the days to begin.</segment1>
		<segment2>Deep calls to deep, in the roar of your waterfalls, all your waves and breakers, have swept over me</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a part of me that escapes from you, it's where my logic prevents a complete embrace. And this is where I need you to wash me away in your waves, leave me somehow speechless with praise</segment3>
		<segment4>Throw away the many things that keep my from being all yours. And in this surrender, I give you a chance to take my breath away with everything you are.     </segment4>
