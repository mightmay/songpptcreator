		<segment1>I've sought so hard to sustain this gain. Now watch me give this ground away. What can i do but admit I'm in over my head?. Colors fade from blue to dark red. I'm back into a corner by my choices. I'm hearing those dame dark voices. At the mercy of my desires helpless, trivial. I'm left with no defenses. Stimulus, response, repeated failures-I'm sick. This sickness fills my senses. But despite my apparent loss I see release. This Stalemate, my peace</segment1>
		<segment2>You wilderness is Stalemate. You can't move against me. Stalemate. The walls built around me</segment2>
		<segment3>But as this theme continues to follow close behind, I see so clearly. If I would only let go of my tendencies. I would know what it is to be free. I can't win when I indulge this fantasy. Reduced as a pawn led to misery. &quot;A little detour won't hurt, let me change you slowly. A moment's pleasure, but you'll owe me.&quot;. All encompassing defear awaits the day. I choose to plunge and embrace this nightmare. But the night has an end and I see you. and you see me as the dawn of the one. Who has adopted my ailment, my sickness. My Stalemate reveals my blindness to my own condition</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll still run away from six seconds of defeat, six years of agony. I'll still stand at odds with six seconds of defeat, six years of agony</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm senseless, erode my senses. To fill my day with indulgence which leads to my undoing. I'll never look back, I'll never taste it again.    </segment5>
