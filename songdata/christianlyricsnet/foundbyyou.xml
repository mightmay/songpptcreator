		<segment1>I've been looking for some answers here. Searching harder for a new way there. I'm still walking all alone. And I don't think I'll make it home, but.. There is something that I know for sure</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. You brought me out here on my own. To find my way through things unknown. I know that I can't make it without You. When days are long and skies are grey. I'll walk with You, You lead the way. Some say that I am lost, but that's not true. 'Cause really I am found by You</segment2>
		<segment3>Things they seem a little clearer now (seem so clear). Found the right direction here somehow (right direction here). Fear is gone and trust is new. So, I don't care what others do. I will give up anything I have</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes I can't feel (feel You near). Is this life for real? I need to know. I'm running out of hope. I'm running out of time. I need You to remind me of Your love</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
