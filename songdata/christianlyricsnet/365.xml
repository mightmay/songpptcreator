		<segment1>I'd like to see you more than on just holidays. 'Cause I really miss you, When Christmas is so far away. Love like a snowflake, Catch it before it's too late. And if I could freeze time, this season. Would come every day </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: 'Cause I would love for Christmas to stay 365 days. No one dear would be far away. Love would be the gift away. Love would be the gift we gave 365 days. The laughter of children, More food than I'll ever taste. Good friends and family surround me as I celebrate. God in a manger and miracles that we attain. I pray that this year good will and peace would remain </segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS    </segment3>
