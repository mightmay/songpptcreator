		<segment1>We came here to rock this jam. Spread His love is the master of plan. Let this light ignite like a star. Everybody in the party knows who we are. You gotta get down, dance around, floss your style. P.O.D., guarantee, make it worth your while. Bad vibes, leave 'em at the door. Soulcheck'n, housewreck'n, keep 'em begg'n for more. We came to rock the party all night long. So party people won't ya sing that song. We came to rock the party all night long. And keep it live till the break of dawn</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey DJ won't ya play that song. And we'll keep dancing till the break of dawn. Keep it live like the way it should. Ain't nobody gett'n crazy so you know it's all good. B-boys, fly-girls one time. Friend of yours is a friend of mine. Don't brother stopping till this jam is through. If you been here before then you know how we do</segment2>
		<segment3>We came to rock the party all night long. So party people won't ya sing that song. We came to rock the party all night long. And keep it live till the break of dawn</segment3>
		<segment4>We got to play what we feel. Then I can say I came real. Don't wanna be caught mess'n around. Cuz a party ain't a party when it gets shut down. Off the hook, with the cutz, that's right. Feel'n loose cuz it sounds so tight. Rock da spot till the very end. Make sure that you're there when we do it again</segment4>
