		<segment1>Let me drown in an ocean of devotion. Let my joy be in service and love my emotion. Let me be closer that your right hand. Tighter than your left hand and let me be a godly man. 'til the day I die, 'til the fire's just smoke. I will go for broke 'til my last word's spoke. If I limp then I will run with a limp. I'll win some and lose some, but I'll make my attempt</segment1>
		<segment2>Last breath before the candle flickers out. I will speak the name of Jesus.</segment2>
		<segment3>I will keep fightin' to the knockout, even if I'm knocked out. Hittin' hard, I'm hittin' for the belt. My soul will keep going 'til my body buckles out. Until my bloody knuckles carry us to heaven by the truckfulls. I will be as stubborn as a pitbull, Neutral as a Nazi, resolute like Ghandi. I will keep preachin' 'til I'm took out, til I'm heaven en route. No sell out!</segment3>
		<segment4>Last breath before the candle flickers out. I will speak the name of Jesus.     </segment4>
