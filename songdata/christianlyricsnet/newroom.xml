		<segment1>Break through these scars, I'm holding on to past desperation. Stepping towards the only door I seem to see, that light is coming out of. Walk through, there's more to this on the other side. Here we start another day, I hope we can move on past this destination. Forward we walk to keep ourselves moving on, to what comes next in our hearts. We can move on, don't just stand still. Don't just stand there and take a step    </segment1>
