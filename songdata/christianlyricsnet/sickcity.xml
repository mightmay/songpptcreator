		<segment1>My city, Your city. Our sick are kissing the sick. Open your eyes, Open your mouth. And strip away the sun to see the bones. The darkness takes the worst of ourselves to give. It hurts when all is gone. It's just so hard to live</segment1>
		<segment2>Our blood, Our veins. Our sin, Our pain (2x)</segment2>
		<segment3>This night is ours to own. Open your eyes, Open your mouth. And get things right in this place. So wrong. This city, Sick city. What dead will bury the dead. So now lets pray away. Our sin, Our shame</segment3>
		<segment4>Redemption can't be found. Within yourself or those around</segment4>
		<segment5>My city, Your city. Our sick are kissing the sick. Open your eyes, Open your mouth. And strip away the sun to see the bones. The darkness takes the worst of ourselves to give. It hurts when all is gone. It's just so hard to live</segment5>
		<segment6>Our blood, Our veins. Our sin, Our pain (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>My city, Your city. This is a sick city (2x)</segment7>
		<segment8>Sick City (3x)    </segment8>
