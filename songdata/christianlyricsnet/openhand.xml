		<segment1>Intersect; cross the lines. Break the barriers; link the areas. Unify our stakes; take my hand. Grip this man and fill the land. Rectify our states; stand together. None are better; so send the letters. Vilify the walls. Freedom is to come as one. To take hold of this day, no other way</segment1>
		<segment2>You won't find me gone. Raised hands surround us. Three nails to protect us. I'll find my way back home. Raised hands surround us. Three nails to protect us</segment2>
		<segment3>I place my fate in your hands. Loss of self, no demands. So to give my years I'll relent and drop my pride. Cross the fence so to confide</segment3>
		<segment4>Laid hands on my head. Sense of self long since dead. Sever words got my back. So let off, and set off and snap my shame away. You ask me what's the point to scrape and fight. To win another day to live. My answer is to stand united, we can't live divided. Until we die and gain what's ours to claim    </segment4>
