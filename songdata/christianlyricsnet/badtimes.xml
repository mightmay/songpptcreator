		<segment1>He walked away.. Turned around to watch friends fade. Chased by enemies, he made, Like sin and lust, Collecting dust on his faith. Sure they showed him the good times, But they all ended in bad times. In bad times.</segment1>
		<segment2>But I dont need them anymore, It's not to even out the score.</segment2>
		<segment3>I walked away.. Turned around to watch friends fade. Chased by enemies, I made, Like sin and lust, Collecting dust on my faith. Sure they showed me the good times, But they all ended in bad times. In bad times.</segment3>
		<segment4>And I don't need them anymore, It's time to even out the score.</segment4>
		<segment5>And now my feet are planted firm on staying pure, I'm new. My past has no place here, Though I may slip, Who knows?. I might not, I just might not. Yeah they showed me the good times, But they all ended in bad times. In bad times.    </segment5>
