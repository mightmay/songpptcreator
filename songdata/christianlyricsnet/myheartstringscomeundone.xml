		<segment1>It's buried deep within the past , i hope it doesn't last. It's something i already chased, i already chased. I try to give it all away, but it's never gonna fade. It's something i don't wanna face, i don't wanna face. I know you feel it's all the same, but I promise that i'll change. It's something i already chased, i already chased. You know i'm trying to believe that you're never gonna leave. It's something i don't wanna face, i don't wanna face. There's nothing left! The fear is gone. Oh, my heartstrings come undone. I will wait for you, pray for you. Before i make my final run. I will stay with you, decay with you. I know i'm not the perfect one, the pain has just begun. It's something i already chased, i already chased. You bring me to a better path, it's everything i asked. It's something i don't wanna face, i don't wanna face. There's nothing left! The fear is gone. There's nothing left! The fear is gone. Oh, my heartstrings come undone. I will wait for you, pray for you. Before i make my final run. I will stay with you, decay with you    </segment1>
