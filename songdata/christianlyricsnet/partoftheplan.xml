		<segment1>Since 1969 the devil has been messing with your mind. wanting your soul content with nothing less. Digging you a hole leaving you a mess. Six-feet-deep is where you gonna end up. Throw your hands in the air let me see you surrender. This is no game wake up it's real life. I wanna drown myself in the blood of Christ</segment1>
		<segment2>Hear me - God can you hear me. Save me - Take away the yoke of sin. Take me - Take my hand Lord. Hand - Walk with me Lord. Let me - Let me God let me. Just be - Oh God I wanna be. part of your plan</segment2>
		<segment3>Since 1978 I've been knock knock knocking on heaven's gate. I won't let sin control my life. Won't let dope gimme a high. The toob spits sex right in your faces. I'm so sick of violence drug dealers and hate. When I think of all this I feel like going insane. With heavenly thoughts I wanna fill my brain    </segment3>
