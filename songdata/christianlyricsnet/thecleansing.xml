		<segment1>..Out from the darkened night, Into the burning hot cleansing steam..</segment1>
		<segment2>My weak endeavour to stay clean;. From all the filth that I've gladly taken in. Failed escape from reality;. My soul lies unwanted with a stain of sin..</segment2>
		<segment3>I feel myself impure;. I need the cleansing;. Craving for more of your love..</segment3>
		<segment4>I feel myself unclean;. I need the cleansing;. Oh, wash me clean from these stains in me..</segment4>
		<segment5>..Out from the hot burning steam, Into the frozen cold granular snow..</segment5>
		<segment6>The filth I've seen on my way;. Hasn't stain me like the evil from within. Evil deeds and words I say;. I've soiled my soul with a stain of sin..</segment6>
		<segment7>I feel myself impure;. I need the cleansing;. Craving for more of your love..</segment7>
		<segment8>I feel myself unclean;. I need your blessing;. Only you can clean these stains in me..    </segment8>
