		<segment1>(Intro Scat:Hold up, oh no, who let them in the door, It's like a freak show, shake it a like a photo)</segment1>
		<segment2>Hate, is only what you say, not what you mean, And Pain, is what's inside of me, not when you're bleeding. I, will fall, I'll fall, and take your breathe away, We, could change it all, and take your breathe away</segment2>
		<segment3>This anger changes me, it effects the way I see, Effects every part of me, and makes you my enemy. But when it falls apart, it's like a brand new start, And I can't remember why, I ripped everything apart</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm still my worst enemy, The world around me all can see what they want to see, I need some help, because I'm still my worst enemy, No matter where I am, I'll still get the best of me, I'm my own enemy</segment4>
		<segment5>Shake, the world inside of me, until it can't be shaken, Wake, the words inside of me, before it's all too late. ('cause). I will fall, I'll fall, and take your breathe away, We will change, it all, and take your breathe away</segment5>
		<segment6>This anger changes me, it effects the way I see, Effects every part of me, and makes you my enemy. But when it falls apart, it's like a brand new start, And I can't remember why, I ripped everything apart</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm still my worst enemy, The world around me all can see what they want to see, I need some help, because I'm still my worst enemy, No matter where I am, I'll still get the best of me, I'm my own enemy (X2)</segment7>
		<segment8>My own enemy, ...my own enemy.     </segment8>
