		<segment1>This is my Fathers world. and to my listening ears, all nature sings and round me rings. the music of the spheres. This is my Fathers world, I rest me in the thought. of rocks and trees, of skies and seas, His hand, the wonders wrought. </segment1>
		<segment2>This is my Fathers world, the birds, their carols raise, the morning light, the lily white. declare their makers praise. This is my Fathers world, He shines in all thats fair. In the rustling grass I hear Him pass, He speaks to me everywhere. </segment2>
		<segment3>This is my Fathers world, oh let me neer forget. that though the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet. This is my Fathers world, the battle is not done. Jesus, who died, shall be satisfied. and earth and heaven be one    </segment3>
