		<segment1>It's all the same. Same old town with a different name. That's fine by me. There's only one place that I wanna see. Southbound on I-5. Windows down and music on the stereo. I'm drivin' and I'm dreamin'. There's no place I'd rather go. Staring at white lines on the side of the road. (Playing every night with the occasional fight). Been on the road awhile. I gotto get back to a place with style. Hang out, havin' fun. I gotta get back to the beach in the sun</segment1>
