		<segment1>She sits alone and wonders, When is the end of broken dreams?. This isnt what I pictured. She says as tears run down her cheeks. She needs a friend beside her, Shes looking for a savior.</segment1>
		<segment2>Hold on, hold on. Someone will find you. Hold on, hold on. Somebody loves you.</segment2>
		<segment3>She grabs her coat to leave, So sure its gonna be the end. Another broken family, Tears are her only friends. This isnt the life they wanted, Shes hoping that heaven comes through.</segment3>
		<segment4>Hold on, hold on. Someone will find you. Hold on, hold on. Somebody loves you. Yeah. Hold on, hold on. Youre not drowning this time. Hold on, hold on. Look for the search lights.</segment4>
		<segment5>Does anybody care?. Do you even see?. Look past my skin, Do you see me?. Do you even know what Im going through?. I need to talk to someone, Can I talk to you?. Does anybody care?. Does anybody care?. Does anybody care?. Oh</segment5>
		<segment6>Hold on, hold on. Someone will find you. Hold on, hold one. Somebody loves you. Yeah. Hold on, hold on. Youre not drowning this time. Hold on, hold on. Look for the search lights.</segment6>
		<segment7>Hold on, hold on..    </segment7>
