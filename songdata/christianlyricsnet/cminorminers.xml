		<segment1>Failed at wit and construct. Happenings unbeknown to us. Not soon here nor after. Remnants wired to none of us. Worse to be uncertain. Caught in claustrophobia. Learned all the unlearned fears. Timid toward the other ones</segment1>
		<segment2>It's unbeknown, whether we will find a hope for.. It's unbeknown, whether we will find a hope for us</segment2>
		<segment3>A past to keep confusion present. Long on speech and taunts. Crippled by the meaning. Paralyzed by modern thought     </segment3>
