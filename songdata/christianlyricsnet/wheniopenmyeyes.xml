		<segment1>A hand to hold. Is often hard to see. And I cannot. Deny You're reaching out to me. The day is gone. And still I know You're near. And I've got nothing to fear</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. But when I open my eyes. You're the first thing I see. A vision once clouded. I feel Your presence over me. From when the sun comes up. 'Til I fall asleep at night. I know You'll be there. When I open my eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>Now granted.. I've been here a time or two. I've learned, I've lived. And now I've learned again. I pray that I.. I might become like You. I've got nothing to lose</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Your love is like the ocean. It never stops rolling in. You are my world. I can't survive without You. With You it's all surrender. In that I find such peace. Tell me this is no dream, yah..</segment5>
		<segment6>When I open my eyes. Oh Lord, I feel Your presence over me. From when the sun comes up. 'Til I fall asleep at night. I know You'll be there. I know that You'll be there..</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS    </segment7>
