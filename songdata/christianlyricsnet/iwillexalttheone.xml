		<segment1>what can I say. what can I do. what can I bring to offer You. there is no gold. no precious pearl. nothing on earth that compares to You. Lord here I stand with empty hands. I will exalt the one who lifted me. out of the miry clay to heights of eagles wings. words cannot express. all I know is this. You've changed me. You've changed me. I can remember how I used to be. I was so bound but now I'm free. I will exalt the one who lifted me. what can I say. a father like You. a love that is strong. gentle and true. You draw me close. just like a child. safe in Your arms. there is no doubt. this is my place. this is my way.     </segment1>
