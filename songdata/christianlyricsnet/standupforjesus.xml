		<segment1>Living for Jesus is the way I will go. I'll follow Him always, don't care what men say. I've been on both sides and I know where I'll stay. The light He has shown me will not fade away</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Stand up, stand up, stand up for Jesus. Oh can't you hear me, He's the way. Stand up, stand up, stand up for Jesus. Oh can't you hear me, He's the way</segment2>
		<segment3>Where are you standing if you were to fall. Religion won't help you if He calls on you now. Stand up and be counted say I'm for the Lord. Don't keep so quiet, go forth and be bold</segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus -.     </segment4>
