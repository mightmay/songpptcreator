		<segment1>I'll worship at Your throne. Whisper my own love song. With all my heart I'll sing. For You my Dad and King. I'll live for all my days. To put a smile on Your face. And when we finally meet. It'll be for eternity. And oh, how wide. You open up Your arms. When I need Your love. How far You would come. If ever I was lost. And You said that all You feel for me. Is undying love. That You showed me through the cross. I'll worship You, my God. I'll worship You, my God. I love You, I love You. Forever I will sing. Forever I will be with You. Be with You. I'll worship at Your throne. Whisper my own love song. With all my heart I'll sing. For You my Dad and King. I'll live for all my days. To put a smile on Your face. And when we finally meet. It'll be for eternity. And, oh, how wide. You open up Your arms. When I need Your love. How far You would come. If ever I was lost. You said that all You feel for me. Is undying love. That You showed me through the cross. I'll worship You, my God. I'll worship You, my God. I love You, I love You. Forever I will sing. Forever I will be with You. I'll be with You. I'll worship You, my God. I'll worship You, my God. I love You, I love You. Forever I will sing. Forever I will be with You. Be with You. I'll worship You, Lord Jesus. I love You. Forever I will sing to You, Lord Jesus. Forever. I'll worship You, my God. I'll worship You, my God. I love You, I love You. Forever I will sing. Forever I will be with You. Be with You. Worship You, Lord. Worship You, Lord    </segment1>
