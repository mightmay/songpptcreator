		<segment1>When we were kids we thought we'd stay this way. But now we've all grown up. I never thought it'd be the way it is now. All the time we have spent growing up not knowing who to be. Now I see that I know just how I should feel. Now it's all gone and all that's left are memories, Of the children that we used to be, in our hearts. All the time we have spent growing up not knowing who to be. Now I see that I know just how I should feel. Now those times are gone but we'll have to carry on and finally start to live our lives. Now those times are gone but it doesn't really matter because they'll always live in our minds.     </segment1>
