		<segment1>Lying here, in this pit that life's pushed me down. I don't know, just how long I can take or when I might break. I'm in needing so someone, please show me the truth</segment1>
		<segment2>This need is real in my soul I feel the love You shared that's why I can't say no again. My thoughts are confused for my sins Your abused. My heart it screams, to open up and let You in</segment2>
		<segment3>In my mind, I'm still fighting to understand. Nothing's free, but what You offer me, You give so freely, though it cost You Your life and inside, You show me the truth</segment3>
		<segment4>This need is real in my soul I feel the love You shared that's why I can't say no again. My thoughts are confused for my sins Your abused. My heart it screams, to open up and let You in. You know I try to do it. To be a self made man</segment4>
		<segment5>I tried to place it all upon my back again. But this crushing weight was well beneath the skin. Panicking for the light, an inner struggle I fight. But then I realized that You could be the only way</segment5>
		<segment6>This need is real in my soul I feel the love You shared that's why I can't say no again. My thoughts are confused for my sins Your abused. My heart it screams, to open up and let You in</segment6>
		<segment7>Let You in..    </segment7>
