		<segment1>Thought that I was all alone, broken and afraid. But You were there with me. Yes, You were there with me</segment1>
		<segment2>And I didn't even know that I had lost my way. But You were there with me. Yes, You were there with me</segment2>
		<segment3>Til You opened my eyes, I'd never know. That I couldn't ever make it without You</segment3>
		<segment4>Even though the journey's long. And I know the road is hard. Well, the One who's gone before me. He will help me carry on. After all that I've been through, now I realize the truth. That I must go through the valley to stand upon the mountain of God</segment4>
		<segment5>As I travel on the road that You have lead me down. You are here with me. Yes, You are here with me. I have need for nothing more. Oh, now that I have found that You are here with me. Yes, You are here with me</segment5>
		<segment6>I confess from time to time, I lose my way. But You are always there to bring me back again</segment6>
		<segment7>Sometimes, I think of where it is I've come from. And the things I've left behind. But of all I've had, what I possessed. Nothing can quite compare with what's in front of me. With what's in front of me    </segment7>
