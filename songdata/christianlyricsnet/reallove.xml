		<segment1>Lord, there's no way I could hide, the emptiness inside. So I knew what I had to do. Stretch my faith out on you, I knew you would come through. The realest love I found in you. You said you would take care of me, if I just believe. Then I will see that I can't make it no other way no. So I must follow where you go</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Because I found real love. Lord when I gave you my trust. You proved there is no greater love. And there's no need to look no further no. When it seemed all hope was gone, you said to depend on</segment2>
		<segment3>And put my trust in only you. When I gave in totally, something took over me. You gave my heart perfect peace. Lord I know you were there with me, waiting patiently. To take care of me, and now I know. it's you that made my way clear. You calmed all my fears</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
