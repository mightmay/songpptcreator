		<segment1>Come into this sacred place. Come into my heart and sing Your song of grace. Pull me safe into the deep. Pull me in to where the depths of love meet. Sing, sing over me until dawn. Pull me safe into the deep </segment1>
		<segment2>Come and carry me away. Come into my heart and turn this night to day. Come into this sacred place. Come into my heart and sing </segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause I can hear You now. And You're the only sound. I give You all my love. You've rescued me. You embrace me, and You calm me. You persuade me, You console me     </segment3>
