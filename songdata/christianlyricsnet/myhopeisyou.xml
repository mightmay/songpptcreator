		<segment1>To you, O Lord, I lift my soul. In you, O God, I place my trust. Do not let me be put to shame. Nor let my enemies triumph over me</segment1>
		<segment2>My hope is you. Show me your ways. Guide me in Truth. In all my days. My hope is you</segment2>
		<segment3>I am, O Lord, filled with your love. You are, O God, my salvation. Guard my life and rescue me. My broken spirit shouts. My mended heart cries out..    </segment3>
