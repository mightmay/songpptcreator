		<segment1>By the hand of Your Spirit. Play the strings of my heart. And reveal all my hidden songs. By Your love let me heart it. When the song in my heart is not for You</segment1>
		<segment2>Hold me in Your hands. Receive me as I am. And take. Take me away. I wanna be in the secret place</segment2>
		<segment3>On the waves of Your mercy. I will sail on Your sea. I will give to You all of me. In the light of Your glory. I will lay on my face and worship You</segment3>
		<segment4>Hold me in Your hands. Receive me as I am. And take. Take me away. I wanna be in the secret place</segment4>
		<segment5>With You is where I wanna be. Lord I worship You. Lord I love You. Lord I love You. Lord I need You. Lord I love You. Lord I need You. Lord I worship You. And I lift my heart and my hands to You. All my days    </segment5>
