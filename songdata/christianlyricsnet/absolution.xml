		<segment1>Across the board, it seems I cannot comprehend. Why you would subjugate, then act like we are friends?. It makes no sense, slaves at best. Don't try to hide the fact that you are unaware of all our thoughts</segment1>
		<segment2>I won't be scared that you won't let yourself be done. You are a servant to the chains which come undone</segment2>
		<segment3>I won't be, liberty. Don't try to hide the fact that you are ignorant of your demise</segment3>
		<segment4>Absolution. Absolution. Absolution</segment4>
		<segment5>Free yourself from whatever it is that holds you back. We know the dreams you had to pinpoint your attack. But you will be, liberty. Don't let the fact that you've been weak before control you from inside</segment5>
		<segment6>Absolution. Absolution. Absolution    </segment6>
