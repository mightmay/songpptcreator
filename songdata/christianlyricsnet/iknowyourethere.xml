		<segment1>If all I had was one last breath, I'd spend it just to sing your praise, just to say your name. If all I had was one last prayer, I'd pray it cos I know you're always listening. If I could live a thousand lives, bind the hands of time. I would spend every moment by your side</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause I, I know you're there, I know you see me. You're the air I breathe, you are the ground beneath me. I know you're there, I know you hear me. I can find you anywhere</segment2>
		<segment3>If all I had was one more song to sing. I would raise a noise to make the heavens ring. If all I had once last chance I would take it I would stake it all on you</segment3>
		<segment4>If I could rise up high and catch a glipse of every eye. I would make them believe what I feel inside</segment4>
		<segment5>'Cause I, I know you're there, I know you see me. You're the air I breathe, you are the ground beneath me. Know you're there, I know you hear me. I can find you anywhere</segment5>
		<segment6>If I could live a thousand lives and bind the hands of time. If I could rise up high and catch a glipse of every eye</segment6>
		<segment7>I know you're there, I know you see me. You're the air I breathe, you are the ground beneath me. I know you're there, I know you hear me. I can find you anywhere</segment7>
		<segment8>I know you're there, I know you're there, I know you're there    </segment8>
