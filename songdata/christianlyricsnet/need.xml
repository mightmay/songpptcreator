		<segment1>Lady's and Gentlemen..Tyrone Wells. I don't love you baby. Don't love you at all. I don't want you baby. Don't want you at all. I fear it's worse than that. I fear it's worse than that. Chorus: I need you, I need you baby. This craving makes me crazy. I'm dieing inside. Baby make up your mind. I need you, I need you baby. I'm holding on but barely. I'm dieing inside. When I cannot hide my need. I don't miss you baby. Don't miss you tonight. I don't want to hold you. Don't want to touch you just right. I fear it's worse than that. I fear it's worse than that. (Chorus). How could you just walk away. Nonchalant and unafraid. It feels to me like you just took my soul. (Chorus). I need you, I need you baby. I'm holding on but barely. I'm dieing inside. When I cannot hide my need. Oh need, Oh Need.     </segment1>
