		<segment1>Test this gold for its worth is the same as testing me. And the fire burns easily today</segment1>
		<segment2>The net is the good that's left after the metal is refined. As I melt, look at what I've got and. Separate it all from what I need</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll take anything, anything genuine. Looking up from where I went I could take whatever I get. I'll take anything, anything genuine</segment3>
		<segment4>More interesting is my faith than the fear of what I'll miss. And those things are temporary anyway</segment4>
		<segment5>Still on this side getting fit for a faith that's been tried. And I smile more believably while getting just enough to know I need</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll take anything, anything genuine. Looking up from where I went, I could take whatever I get. Falling from Your hands or falling from Your lips. As long as it's from You, I know that I can take it, I can take it</segment6>
		<segment7>And I'll rejoice.    </segment7>
