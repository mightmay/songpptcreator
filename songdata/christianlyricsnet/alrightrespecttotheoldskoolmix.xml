		<segment1>There's so much on my mind lately. I can't make out my own thoughts anymore. I don't know where one begins and the other one ends. I wish that I could push a button and turn it all off. Just for a little while. Long enough to take a breath and then I'll know. It'll be OK. It'll be alright. There's so much that needs done lately. I can't make out what's important anymore. I don't know where my needs begin and someone else's ends. I don't wanna let anybody down, 'cause I feel like I've fallen down when I do. But for now would someone else please volunteer to say. It'll be OK. It'll be alright. Life is hard for everyone. So let's blow it all off. Just for a little while. Let's take a break. It'll still be there when we get back. I always try to solve all our problems by working real hard. Going just another mile. But every now and then I think we should let it go and say. It'll be OK. It'll be alright. This is my last verse and it's for everyone feeling not so great today. We don't know what's coming just around the bend. Always hard to believe in your own life. Easier to find belief for a friend. I'll hope for you, you for me. And together we can say. It'll be OK. It'll be alright.     </segment1>
