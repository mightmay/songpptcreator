		<segment1>I live with the old swing and trumpets. And fly through my country and play it. And those who have calling, they have it</segment1>
		<segment2>And everyone needs a light. A place in the sun. I like your photographs. I need one</segment2>
		<segment3>You act like a stranger and I'll bet. You gave them my number and the rest. To those who keep calling and run it</segment3>
		<segment4>And everyone needs a light. A place in the sun. I like your photographs. I need one</segment4>
		<segment5>Leave here a stranger    </segment5>
