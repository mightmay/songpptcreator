		<segment1>Pulling your confidence through. Some courage is well overdue. I believe solely in all your promise. Why waste a second in doubt. You could be helping you out. Keeping your head in the clear</segment1>
		<segment2>Like an instrument for a song. Like the sun for tomorrow's dawn. Every moment of time's just an answer to find. What you're here for, what you breathe for. What you wake for, what you bleed for</segment2>
		<segment3>Everyone's counting on you. Save for yourself what to do. Life is a card that you lay down sometimes. To search for the best way of all. Is finding the best way to fall. Keeping your head in the clear</segment3>
		<segment4>Every moment of time's just an answer to find. What you're here for, what you breathe for. What you wake for, what you bleed for. What you hope for, what you live for. What you're here for, what you breathe for, what you live for. What you're here for, what you bleed for, what you live for    </segment4>
