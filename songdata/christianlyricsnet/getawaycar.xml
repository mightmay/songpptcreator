		<segment1>Im staring unaware cause Im in the zone. It moves in like a fog on a seaside road. Paralyzed by the signs and the deafening tone. Im on a lock like a jock with a broken bone. I can see the real game and I want to get in it. I can read your headline and I am dying to spin it. Man down in the clutches of his own desire. I got to find the kind of speed that will put out a fire</segment1>
		<segment2>I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far. I need a getaway car, I wanna flea what I see, wanna be where you are. I need a getaway car, I gotta get out of here fast and far. I need a getaway car</segment2>
		<segment3>I put my hand on the wheel before I change my mind. I put my foot to the floor and I start to fly. I keep my eyes on the road so I dont get spun around. To the nightmare Ive been delivered from. Its a brand new day, I drove hard all night. I thank God for the sun as it starts to rise. I take a peek in the mirror and my past is gone. Im feelin free as a bird with a new song</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I aint gonna stop til I find your peace. I gotta get to the place where its you and me. So filler up now, and lets roll. Gonna drive through the night til you touch my soul. Said I aint gonna stop til I find your peace. I gotta get to the place where youre all I need. So filler up, lets roll. Im gonna drive through the night till you touch my soul</segment4>
		<segment5>Lets ride all night, lets shift this thing into overdrive.     </segment5>
