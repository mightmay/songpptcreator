		<segment1>I still don't know what I want to do. I'd probably still ask you if I knew. What I'm doing now seems to be okay. If it's your will if it's your way. Don't want to have to deal with pointless bureaucracy. Making sure where something goes or making sure that your agree. Well I don't even know what my choices are. Should I fly a plane, or should I drive a car?. Nothing's clear to me, my eyes won't do a thing for me. I'll just wait right here, until I am what I will be. Whatever it is I'm sure ill know, when the time comes he will show. Me what to do, and me where to go. All I've got is a skateboard and a guitar. I go to a lot of punk shows a I drive a car. I don't like to work and I don't like to go to school. The teachers think that I'm a girl and the kids they think that I'm uncool. I'm just not interested in much of anything. Wouldn't want to be a president, don't want to be a king. I just want to ride my skateboard just want to play my bass. Every now and then strum a chord, sometimes land right on my face. Have you any ideas? I can't tell by a chart. I wanna do what he wants me to, I'm gonna do my part-yah!</segment1>
