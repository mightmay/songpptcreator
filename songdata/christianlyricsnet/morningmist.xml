		<segment1>Afraid to open my eyes. Horror of facing the day.</segment1>
		<segment2>Mist of the morning is fading, while cancer burn in my bones. Horror of facing the pain.</segment2>
		<segment3>Years ago I had plans, what to do with my life. But now it all is so futile.</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh. again my fears come true. and painkillers are out of effect. To the pain I must reconcile.</segment4>
		<segment5>The color of my desperation, if I wouldn't be heading to Christ. Would even be darker than now.</segment5>
		<segment6>My dream is to wake one morning. without these tears of pain. Oh. why can't I just die?</segment6>
		<segment7>The color of my desperation, if I wouldn't be heading to Christ. Would even be darker than now.</segment7>
		<segment8>My dream is to wake one morning. without these tears of pain. Oh. why can't I just die?    </segment8>
