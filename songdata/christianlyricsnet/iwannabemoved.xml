		<segment1>This road is winding, narrow and steep. And I can't keep walking with frozen feet, My spirit is not willing;. My heart is cold as ice;. Thaw out my convictions;. The passion's left my life</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I don't wanna be a flame. I wanna be a raging fire!. Tired of my will, my way, Your calling's higher. Oh, I know it's time I stopped running from the Truth. So I'll stand here still, until I'm filled. I wanna be moved. I wanna be moved by You</segment2>
		<segment3>Wanna be a rebel with a Holy cause, Stand against the Devil and hold up my cross, You have a mission for me; a reason why I'm here    </segment3>
