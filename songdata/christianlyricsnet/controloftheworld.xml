		<segment1>You believe? Man what a joke. There is nothing I can't see. My reality is my own creation. And standing in the center is me. Backup! Lookout! Step aside. The decision maker is coming through. On my road to pleasure and self. I'll crush your bones, I'll step on you</segment1>
		<segment2>We are not in control of this world!</segment2>
		<segment3>I stand or fall, I live and breathe. By the choices I have made. I stand on the shoulders of no man. And stand on everyone just the same. My heroes are all smart men. They say control is not our own. Evolutionary Biology, what a genius. Truth cannot be known!</segment3>
		<segment4>You must submit! You must submit!. There are creatures watching you. You lie and say they don't exist. But when you fall they pull you through. There's no dead carcass in the grave. But there's rivers of blood on my hands. Feel like I have lost control. But by the throne He still stands</segment4>
		<segment5>I cannot see it. Possess it. Own it. Control it.     </segment5>
