		<segment1>I rhyme of time when all we knew was love. With bread and wine, friends by your side, And time beneath your glove. You dream of time like that to always stay, But no soon day would ever stay, And tunes will always change.</segment1>
		<segment2>But youre always here and your touch is near, and your sound, so sound, youre always clear, so clear, your voice its clear, your sound, so sound.</segment2>
		<segment3>Now feel the times when all we knew was pain. Where loved ones hearts were locked by scars, And soon their name has changed. But these are times when soon youll see what came. In all this pain theres wholeness found. In One who stays the same. Hes always here and his touch is near, And hes sound, so sound, Hes always clear, so clear, His voice its clear, Hes sound, so sound.</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh. The pain, such lessons in such pain. Such hope in so much pain. How can I call this pain?. Youre always here and your touch is near, And your sound, so sound, Youre always clear, so clear, Your voice its clear, Your sound, so sound.    </segment4>
