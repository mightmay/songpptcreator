		<segment1>You tell me it's nothing but I see it's something in your eyes. A fear is there. You say you don't need me, don't try to deceive me. By pulling the wool over my eyes </segment1>
		<segment2>There's nothing wrong with needing help sometimes. What are friendships for. Now please </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS:]. Don't push me away condemn your pride. Sometimes we all need a hand to get by. Don't push me away condemn your pride. When tears start to fall then with you I will cry </segment3>
		<segment4>No one is perfect, it just isn't worth it to stand on your own. Though fear is there. Don't be ashamed to ask me to help you. To deal with the thoughts, spinning your head </segment4>
		<segment5>There's nothing wrong with needing help sometimes. What are friendships for. Now please </segment5>
		<segment6>[BRIDGE:]. You can lean on me. Stand by my side, we will fight. We are much stronger as one.     </segment6>
