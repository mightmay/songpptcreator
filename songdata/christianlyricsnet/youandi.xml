		<segment1>Put your smile on. Today is gonna save us. Let the bridge down. The sun is gonna wake us</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause somebody's been. Messing around with me. And I don't know. But I'm, I'm thinking maybe</segment2>
		<segment3>We can run into summer, the hotter weather's. Always cool when we're together. The sun is brighter when it shines from the sky. Down to you and I, down to you and I. It's brighter when it's you and I. You and I</segment3>
		<segment4>Let the music play. It's time to start the dancing. Sound the new day. 'Cause it's time to take some chances</segment4>
		<segment5>When somebody's been. Messing around with you. Grab your shoes. 'Cause I was thinking maybe</segment5>
		<segment6>We can run into summer, the hotter weather's. Always cool when we're together. The sun is brighter when it shines from the sky. Down to you and I, down to you and I. It's brighter when it's you and I</segment6>
		<segment7>On the road, just living life. With dreams as big as the Texas sky. Like a summer breeze in warm July. There's you and I</segment7>
		<segment8>Somebody's been. Messing around with us. I don't know. But I'm thinking maybe</segment8>
		<segment9>We can run into summer, the hotter weather's. Always cool when we're together. The sun is brighter when it shines from the sky. Down to you and I, down to you and I. It's brighter when it's you and I. You and I, you and I    </segment9>
