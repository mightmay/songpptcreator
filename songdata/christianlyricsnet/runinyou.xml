		<segment1>If I see You standing, one hundred stars away. It feels as though You're touching me. If I am landing, with a stormy night delay. It's You I want, it's You I need</segment1>
		<segment2>When I'm lost I close my eyes. And suddenly I'm home</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. I just wanna run in You. I just wanna hide in You. I just wanna come to You. And not thirst anymore. I just wanna walk with You. I just wanna ride with You. I just wanna talk to You. And not thirst anymore</segment3>
		<segment4>I feel demanding, I know I'm selfish too. I often live in my own world. I've been commanding, it's my way or we're through. If I am sand, you are the pearl</segment4>
		<segment5>When I'm found I open my eyes. And it's You I see</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus]    </segment6>
