		<segment1>I'm gonna say whatever's on my mind. As you walk away with half of what is mine. Nothing's gonna change. So I'm giving up on you. And you're not gonna change my mind. You complicate until the dotted line. So I wrote this song to try to pass the time. You can't take my dignity. You can't take my pride. I've got my integrity. But you've just crossed the line. No one's even heard of me. Well I'm not gonna cry. I don't want your apology, and I don't want the job    </segment1>
