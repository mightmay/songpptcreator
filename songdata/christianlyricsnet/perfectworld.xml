		<segment1>Bob Hartman. Isaiah 65:17</segment1>
		<segment2>Some believe this world is bound to get much better. They think utopia is just around the bend. They like humanity to come up with the answers. So they can keep their heads safely buried in the sand</segment2>
		<segment3>This is my Father's world and He can fix it. Our hopeless band-aids are all counterfeit</segment3>
		<segment4>In a perfect world, God's throne will come. In a perfect world, in a perfect world. In a perfect world ruled by His Son. In a perfect world, in a perfect world</segment4>
		<segment5>Some still worship Mother Nature in her glory. They do a good thing when they stand up for her right. But Mother Nature has a Father in the heavens. And His creation went astray but never left His sight</segment5>
		<segment6>The old will pass away and bring a new birth. A whole new heaven and a new earth</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>In a perfect world, in a perfect world. In a perfect world, in a perfect world</segment8>
		<segment9>Kingdom come. His will be done. On the earth. As it is in heaven. Till we come to where there is no night. And the Lord Himself will be our light</segment9>
		<segment10>(Chorus)    </segment10>
