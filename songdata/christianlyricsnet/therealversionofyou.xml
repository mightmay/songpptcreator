		<segment1>With my hands under my belt, and my neck so slightly turned. The scenery's in for the fireworks. but like some shadow, you kept following me. Or like some sickness or some discomforting disease. You try to get under my skin. And poison me from within. But when cities fall they. Build them back much taller than they were. Is this love contagious. Well if you really want to know. I never felt the way you did so oh let this go. There's a difference to our opinions. And a chemical imbalance. Terrible with boys. You're so terrible with people. You could be a killer valentine. With a broken heart and bloody knife. But I hope you never really ever go that far. Don't let this go to your head. I told you once before that there's. Really no good reason. You want a reason.     </segment1>
