		<segment1>Why immerse the truth?. Caught our bravery, Between skin and the call of me. Why do we live so pretentiously. In our own skin, we're all hiding. God forbid that we step on someone's toes. A living, breathing generation of the walking dead, Believing nothing is wrong but everything always is. Is this all for the greater good?. We built the bridge from Earth to hell. Even the craze could really save us all, We just can't seem to get over ourselves. God forbid that we step on someone's toes. A living, breathing generation of the walking dead, Believing nothing is wrong but everything always is. Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh oh oh. All the things we think we need, All the things we need have taken his place. All the things we think we need, Have taken his place, have taken his place. God forbid that we step on someone's toe, And God descends, his shape of leg, his heart of stone?. A living, breathing generation of the walking dead, Believing nothing is wrong but everything always is.    </segment1>
