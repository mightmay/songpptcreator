		<segment1>Over and over your blood covers me. How many times will it take me to see. I am so dangerous. I am so irresponsible. Here I am, broken again, but then you show me, you're wearing the scars that save. How can you see me, as something so lovely. Cause it's killing me that you took the blame. Over and over it falls back to me. My knees hit the floor and it's easy to see. I am so arrogant. I feel so unforgivable. This is my same old song. The one where I do it all wrong. And I will try (fight) with all that I am to get it right in the end.     </segment1>
