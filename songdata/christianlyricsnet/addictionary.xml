		<segment1>&quot;Baby girl, stand up. This world's in need of beauty, And it has taken you for granted. And the pain consumes what's in you. Your closest ones held back by the length of an arm. Unable to reach. You have no idea what you put yourself through. Keep on pushing yourself to the floor. You're wasting away in your self-made hell. You're steady in your own demise. Can you feel this racing through your veins?. This is all you need. Why do you do the things that you do to yourself?. You do this to yourself. It's so hard to live with your hands down your throat.&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;I am not in control, and I'm praying for peace to keep. I am not in control, and I'm praying for peace to call my own. It always takes what's left of me. A lesson here is deserved.&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;I built your heart. I built that heart for me. That heart was built for love. You'll never fill the void. Breathe deep, let the smoke fill your lungs. You're steady in your own demise.&quot;    </segment3>
