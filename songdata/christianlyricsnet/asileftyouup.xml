		<segment1>I'm reaching up. I'm reaching out. To be with You, Lord. I wanna be with You now. There's nothing quite like. Your voice in my ear. It's gentle and soft. You know it's honest and real</segment1>
		<segment2>I open my hands. And I open my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus:). As I lift You up from the earth. Won't You draw me in. Won't You pull me close. As I lift Your name to the Heavens. Won't You call me home. Won't You call everyone to Your throne. Won't You draw everyone to Your throne</segment3>
		<segment4>If it is true. Then how can it be. The thing You want most. From me is intimacy. I try in my power. To give you enough. But first what You ask. Is that I give You my love</segment4>
		<segment5>Come make me all that You want me to be. My praises working that all would believe. Change us for all of eternity</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus).     </segment6>
