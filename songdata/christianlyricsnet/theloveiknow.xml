		<segment1>He painted 'I love you' on the bridge. Then watched them burn. She bet all she had upon the love. Now she's holding her cards. And lost her turn. Two hearts in search of wholeness. Both willing to risk it all. Could true love have fled so easily. Leaving both broken from the fall</segment1>
		<segment2>Not the Love i know</segment2>
		<segment3>It knows no boundaries. Keeps no record of wrongs. ..That's the Love I know. It takes the good with the bad. And it fights to stay strong. ..That's the Love I know. This Love always finds a way. To carry on. That's the Love I know</segment3>
		<segment4>He sits all alone. And stares into an empty sky. She goes through all her mixed emotions. Trying to find a reason why. Was their pride to big to swallow. Was their hurt to big to heal. Could they find some understanding. Find forgiveness that's real</segment4>
		<segment5>That's the Love i know</segment5>
		<segment6>It speaks in kindness. Its seeks only what's true. ..That's the Love I know. A love without condition. It looks to renew. ..That's the Love I know. It knows that when hope seems gone. Hope will come through. That's the Love I know</segment6>
		<segment7>The Love I know comes from a holy God to man. Isn't it time that you received it. Are you starting to understand. The Love I know</segment7>
		<segment8>That's the Love I know. It speaks in kindness. It seeks only what's true. ..That's the Love I know. A Love without condition. It looks to renew. ..That's the Love I know. It knows that when hope seems gone. Hope will come through. That's the Love I know    </segment8>
