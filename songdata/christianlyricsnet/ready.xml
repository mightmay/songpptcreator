		<segment1>Lately Ive been reeling. Off the way you got me feeling. Ive been tired of this for way too long. You give me answers when I didnt ask. You keep bringing up my past. Always play the same old song. Tired of buying all your lies. Acting like I am alright. So I hope you liked it last time cause that will be the final time I wear my painted smile and sing along. Yesterdays where you belong</segment1>
		<segment2>Ready, ready to put you behind me. Ready, ready to go. Ready, ready to show you the doorway. I think you need to know. That taking your time is out of the question. Youre moving way too slow. Ill never stay down. I dont want you around. Ready, ready to go </segment2>
		<segment3>Can I make it anymore clear?. Youre no longer welcome here. I guess you need to hear it again. Ive got a brand new life. Loves on my side. Games over, you lose I win. Yes, Ill tell you one more time. No see you later its goodbye. Hey, you need to pay attention. I dont know how you keep missin everything Im trying to say. Listen close, Im moving on </segment3>
		<segment4>Ill put this behind me. The way you define me. Love says Im something more. Im over the pain. Im done with the shame. I found what I waited for. You left me with scars. But He healed my heart. I found my place. Secure in His arms. So, Ill put this behind me. Yeah, Ill put you behind. Ill put you behind me.     </segment4>
