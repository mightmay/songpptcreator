		<segment1>I cant see myself without You. With You I get strength to do things Ive never ever dreamt in a million years. Im unstoppable cause Youre here with me. Unbelievable how I can believe how powerful Youve caused me to be, yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>See only You got me flying with eagles, walking on water. With You I can do the impossible. Jump over mountains with one single bound. Ive found out I can do the impossible. Do the impossible</segment2>
		<segment3>No other soul could have saved me, I feel You in every heartbeat. Youre incredible, invincible - so easy to see Youve strengthened me. Im out of this world, oh yeah, now that Im with You. Im unbreakable, there aint no way I can lose</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause heaven is at the end of this road. Me and You, now I know Im not alone. Youre pierced in my heart, Youre not just in my head. This is what makes You the best.     </segment4>
