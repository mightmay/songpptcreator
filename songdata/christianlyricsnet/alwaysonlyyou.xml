		<segment1>One year after the rings and a west coast honeymoon. We are living in a rented house with a terrible view. Youre finishing school and Im writing songs. Weve got no money but our love is strong</segment1>
		<segment2>Im gonna love you always. Even on the not so sunny days. Through the good and the bad. Baby, I still do. Cause its always only you</segment2>
		<segment3>One day maybe youll be a mom and Ill be a dad. But right now, baby just kiss me and lets not think about that. Cause were too busy planning cheap dates. Were rentin old movies and staying up late</segment3>
		<segment4>Im gonna love you always. Even on the not so sunny days. Through the good and the bad. Baby, I still do. Cause its always only you</segment4>
		<segment5>Do you remember the first time you held my hand. Im sure I would have liked that concert, but I wasnt watching the band</segment5>
		<segment6>Im gonna love you always. Even on the not so sunny days. Through the good and the bad. Baby, I still do. I do love you, and I mean always. And I know they wont all be sunny days. But I meant what I said when I said I do. Cause its always only, just you and me. Always only you    </segment6>
