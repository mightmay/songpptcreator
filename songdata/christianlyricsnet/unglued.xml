		<segment1>Restless and alone. A weary soul has traveled home. What am I to do. In a world without you. I can hardly believe. I turned around and you're gone. All the sweet memories. Of loving you for so long </segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes it's hard. Most times I cry. But God holds this heart of mine. He feels the pain inside </segment2>
		<segment3>Broken and undone. You're were the one we counted on. You taught us how to say. I love you. Then you showed us how to pray. I don't want to believe. I turned around and you're gone. All the sweet memories. Of loving you for so long </segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes it's hard. Most times I cry. But God holds this heart of mine. And He heals the pain I hide </segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes it's hard. Most times I cry. But God knows this heart of mine. He feels the pain inside    </segment5>
