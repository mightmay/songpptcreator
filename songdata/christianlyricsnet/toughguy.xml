		<segment1>who are you, to take away the right to live. of your neighbor, doesn't matter the cause. nothing justifies it. you pray for death. you are the first one to weep. when a loved one dies. you feel pride, to be a tough guy, but when you. feel loneliness and tears. begin to fall, you know you need love. seek the real jesus christ. who offers you abundant life. the only one who conquered death.     </segment1>
