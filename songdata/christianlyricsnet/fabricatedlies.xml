		<segment1>All those things you said to me were fabricated lies. Empty promises shattered dreams when no one's on your side. How quickly to dust gold fades away when your life is on the line. Good things come to those who wait. Now who is on your side?. Good things come to those who wait for everything to pass. What is there to count for? All those things you said were false truths. And now that it's all said and done. What's left are empty promises. Looking back it should've been so clear that you offered me the world. But in return all I got was fear and a void that can't be filled. How quickly to dust gold fades when your life is on the line. Good things come to those who wait. Now.. who is on your side?.     </segment1>
