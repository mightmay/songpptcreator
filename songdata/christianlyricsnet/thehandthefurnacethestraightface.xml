		<segment1>Quiet. It's 4 AM. I was. Sound asleep. Trying. To hunt the sheep </segment1>
		<segment2>There is a choice. Within a voice. Lurking somewhere between. Hidden parts. And facial scars. And remnants of the deepest needs. I am convinced. In sleeplessness. That we need some source of rest. Following. With frequency. Won't become a place to lay our heads </segment2>
		<segment3>I've searched. And tried. And tumbled in the midst. I've swallowed pride. And nullified. What's left of innocence. Reparations. Won't be made. We'll set a precedent. Never too late. To recreate. So here's your evidence </segment3>
		<segment4>Am I getting through?. Is this loud enough?. Any means. By all extremes. This feeling follows action. You can take. My worst mistakes. And use them for excuses. Or you can try. To realize. This vessel by itself is worthless. The hand, the furnace, the straight face     </segment4>
