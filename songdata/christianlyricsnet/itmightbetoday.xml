		<segment1>The sun set on a perfect day but then it rose only to say. &quot;It's wrong, there's something wrong.&quot;. They woke up to a burning sound, cars piled up and planes came crashing down. And from the church there rings no song, all the people who went there are gone, they're all gone. The world looks up as if to. &quot;You'd better get yourself back down here right away.&quot;. In the twinkling of an eye, we will say goodbye. It might be today when all we know is going to change. Because we're going up and we're not coming down, and we won't have to do what they say. It might be today. They told us not to hold our breath. &quot;Look at the facts, your God's not coming back.&quot;. He's coming back. What goes up must come down but not this time around. When we hear that sound we're not coming down, it might be today.     </segment1>
