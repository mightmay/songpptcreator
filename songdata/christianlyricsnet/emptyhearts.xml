		<segment1>i've watched them build. upon these empty hearts. false hope of the lossless paradise. gathering together. the dead hearts beat as one. stillborn comfort feeding lies. through the answer of self denial. divided between a dissolute self. and the sorrow of sincere devotion. what is it that you find peace in now. where is your hope in this dark night    </segment1>
