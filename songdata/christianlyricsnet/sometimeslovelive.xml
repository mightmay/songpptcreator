		<segment1>Is our world spinning backwards?. What has brought about this change?. Can't you see that people aren't the same</segment1>
		<segment2>Wish I were dreamin'. And could wake up from my sleep. Find us all the way we used to be</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause the love that used to be is dyin'. Is anybody even tryin'?. And I don't know how, I don't know why. But somethin' in my soul is cryin'</segment3>
		<segment4>Listen</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes love has to drive a nail into its own hand. Sometimes love has to drive a nail into its own hand, into its own hand</segment5>
		<segment6>One pair of Hands broke some bread and washed some feet. Opened eyes and soothed an angry sea. Belong to a Man who could see our deepest need. And showed us love the way it has to be</segment6>
		<segment7>'Cause He knew the price that love requires. And He laid down His own desires. He stretched out His hands to save His friends. And said 'no other love is higher'</segment7>
		<segment8>So listen to me now singin'</segment8>
		<segment9>Sometimes love has to drive a nail into its own hand, into its own hand. Sometimes love has to drive a nail into its own hand, into its own hand</segment9>
		<segment10>Love can change us, love can make a way. Only love can change us, love can make a way. Only Jesus' love can change us, love can make a way. Only Jesus' love can change us, love can make a way</segment10>
		<segment11>Love can change us, love can make a way. Love can change us, love can make a way</segment11>
		<segment12>Wish I were dreamin'. And could wake up from my sleep. And find us all the way we used to be     </segment12>
