		<segment1>So what I'm not your average girl. I don't meet the standards of this world. Chasing after boys is not my thing. See I'm waiting for a wedding ring</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. No more dating. I'm just waiting. Like sleeping beauty. My prince will come for me. No more dating. I'm just waiting. 'Cause God is writing my love story</segment2>
		<segment3>Boys are bad; that's certainly not true. 'Cause God's preparing one for you. If you get tired waiting till he comes. God's arms are the perfect place to run</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Sleep - that's the only thing for me. 'Cause when I sleep . God's preparing one for me</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
