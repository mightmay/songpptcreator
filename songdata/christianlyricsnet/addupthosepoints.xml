		<segment3>Oh brother hold your head high. But here is the fall. I'm watching your feet go over with your eyes wide shut. New record, new shirt, the hair to match. I'm ready. To work. The room weighs heavy that your in. My friend you had less points then</segment3>
		<segment4>I apologize. I've been trying to look up. Not around this time. Your weak my friend. Your shoulder is cold. We just talked yesterday. When did this crowd form?. Do I need to check in at the door?</segment4>
		<segment5>You'd rather wave your new flag and. Biting down on your own insecurity. You invite division. Amongst a group. Called unity</segment5>
