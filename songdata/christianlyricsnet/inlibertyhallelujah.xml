		<segment1>WHEN MY SOUL IS WEAK, I SING GOD STRENGTHEN ME. WHEN I FIND MYSELF IN NEED, I SING GOD RESCUE ME. WHEN MY TROUBLES OVERWHELM, I SING GOD BRING YOUR PEACE. LORD YOUR ONE AND ONLY SON IS ALL I EVER NEED. HALLELUJAH, YOUR LOVE HAS SET ME FREE. HALLELUJAH, BY YOUR OFFERING. OUR FATHER, IN YOU I BELIEVE. HALLELUJAH, I STAND IN LIBERTY. IF MY WORLD COMES CRASHING DOWN, IN YOUR LOVE LORD ILL BE FOUND. AND THIS FREEDOM IVE RECEIVED CAUSES ME TO SING. IM FREE, FREE, ALL MY CHAINS ARE BROKEN.    </segment1>
