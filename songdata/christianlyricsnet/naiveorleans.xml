		<segment1>Come and go now as you please. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. And you just sing </segment1>
		<segment2>And I finally found that life goes on without you. And my world still turns when you're not around </segment2>
		<segment3>Is this the way you want it?. Is this the way it has to be?. Sitting here beside you. But my heart's lost in New Orleans. Dreams come clever. Hearts now severed. Difference of forever. And I am lost there </segment3>
		<segment4>Come and go now as you please. Your actions write the melodies. To the songs that we sing. And you just sing along out loud    </segment4>
