		<segment1>you'd trade our starving eyes. for a tar and feathered heart. a 25 cent execution. to hear your anthem praises. played on frequency decayed. a breath of frigid self-made winter</segment1>
		<segment2>sing out and sing loud. we'll sing as loud as you do. and hold on hold on. cause this is the end of the line. I'm not falling. of beautiful and sacred things. and your immaculate disguise. I'm trading it in. for my pride war emblem</segment2>
		<segment3>as if I'd fall to pieces. in the wake of your design    </segment3>
