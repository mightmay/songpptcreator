		<segment1>Who is Jesus Christ. The question echoes down Emmaus Road. Dead or raised to life. The same doubts spoken first so long ago. When a stranger came. To two men on their journey. And it was not long before. Their broken hearts were burning </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Somewhere between where you are and Emmaus. A stranger wants to come and walk with you. Somewhere along the way your heart will be burning. Drawn into the holy flame of truth. Right now He may be a stranger to you. What will he be when your journey's through. Somewhere between where you are and Emmaus. The Savior wants to walk with you </segment2>
		<segment3>Some ask Him in to stay. As night falls on their own Emmaus Road. Some push Him away. And never see the mystery unfold. But those who take to heart the word that has been spoken. As He breaks the bread of life their eyes will open </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus (2 times) </segment4>
		<segment5>The Savior wants to walk with you.     </segment5>
