		<segment1>I was looking at the leaves. Climbing to the tops of the trees. But you were nowhere to be found, Just beneath all the green. You were buried like a little seed. Among the roots and underground, I was licking at the leaves. But i was in short sleeves and you. You were like some sickness that I caught. My sweetheart moved away, Swept off like garbage in the alleyway. I need more grace than I thought.</segment1>
		<segment2>Brother, I'm far away from everything good!. She's like a hot cloth on a fevered head. And like a needle she leads me. (Well, I follow like thread). Tie me up!. Untie me!. All this wishing I was dead is geting old.. It goes on but it's old.</segment2>
		<segment3>I was swimming through the waves. For what must have been day. But could find no relief, When I started sinking down. I thought for certain I would drown. Until I saw you in the ocean underneath. All the bright colored fish. Tell of a treasure in a dull shell, &quot;Such subtlely, so easily missed!&quot;. You, my hidden pearl of pure and perfect love. And I'm a living example of 100 percent the oppisite of this, If I ask the same questions. Well maybe I repeat myself from time to time, But it's because everyone who answers me is a liar.</segment3>
		<segment4>She's like a hot cloth on a fevered head. And like a needle she leade me. (Well, I follow like thread). But you untied me - didn't you untie me, Lord?. And now I haven't even thought about. Killing myself in almost five months.     </segment4>
