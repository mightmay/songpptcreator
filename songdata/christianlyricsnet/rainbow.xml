		<segment1>Listen to my story. Then you'll know the glory. Noah saw after the rains came down. And killed the people. Even though they'd been warned. Still they scoffed and they scorned. But they never saw the rainbow </segment1>
		<segment2>The rainbow is a promise. No rain will fall upon us. To destroy the life on earth again. Or the living creatures. That means you, that means me. Every bird, every tree. And He signed it with a rainbow </segment2>
		<segment3>You can have a rainbow. Yes, a living rainbow. If you will accept the son of God. His name is Jesus. He'll wash away your old life. God gave His Son so you might. Know the One who made the rainbow     </segment3>
