		<segment1>If I could speak with tongues of angels. If I could write the future in the sky. If I could know the wisdom of the ages. But have no love what would it mean </segment1>
		<segment2>For the love of God. Let this be my motivation. For the love of God. In this love I'm recreated. For the love of God. It's the reason for giving love away. For the love of God </segment2>
		<segment3>If I have faith, faith to move a mountain. If I give all I own to the poor. If I surrender my body to the flames. But have no love I have nothing </segment3>
		<segment4>When I'm gone let it be said. That I loved You more than anything. While I'm here let all men see. Your love in me.     </segment4>
