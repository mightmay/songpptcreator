		<segment1>Dont cry victim to me. Everything we are and used to be. is buried and gone. Now its my turn to speak. Its my turn to expose and release. Whats been killing me. Ill be damned fighting you. It´s impossible. Impossible. Say goodbye. With no sympathy</segment1>
		<segment2>Im entitled to overcome. Completely stunned, I´m numb. Knock me down, throw me to the floor. Theres no pain, I can feel no more. Im entitled to overcome</segment2>
		<segment3>Overcome</segment3>
		<segment4>Finally see whats beneath. Everything I am and hope to be. Cannot be lost. Ill be damned fighting you. You´re impossible. Impossible. Say goodbye. With no sympathy</segment4>
		<segment5>Im entitled to overcome. Completely stunned, I´m numb. Knock me down, throw me to the floor. Theres no pain, I can feel no more. Im entitled to overcome</segment5>
		<segment6>Overcome</segment6>
		<segment7>Overcome</segment7>
		<segment8>Youll never know what I was thinking before you came round. Take a step, take a breath, put your guard down. I cannot worry anymore of what you think of me. I may be crazy, but Im buried in your memory</segment8>
		<segment9>Im entitled to overcome. completely stunned i´m numb. knock me down throw me to the floor. theres no pain i cant feel no more. Im entitled to overcome. overcome!. (repeat)</segment9>
