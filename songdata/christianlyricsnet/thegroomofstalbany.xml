		<segment1>Don't be jealous. Don't be mad. We've got a lot to learn. We've got a lot to lose, so just take it back. Breathe slowly, come closer. You've got a pretty set of eyes now, Baby, and that's the reason why I chose you.</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus: x2]. Don't scream at me, just breathe baby. Take me by the hand, take me by the heart. You'll never wanna' stop once the lovin' starts.</segment2>
		<segment3>I've been trying to tell you all of the things that I meant. When I said &quot;I do&quot;. I do. You play these games to get my attention. You wanna' start, stop, start, stop, All of the things you know we never should mention.</segment3>
		<segment4>On our wedding day, this angel will grow her wings. And you'll never have to hear me say.</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus x2]</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh baby you look so good when you move. I can't break it up, it just breaks me down.</segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus x2].     </segment7>
