		<segment1>Time goes by and God knows I try to carry on with life. Decide not to hide feelings inside, even though they hurt. Sometimes, I forget to remember you. Its easy to lock away the pains, dont want to relive it through. But I stay strong, you taught me how to move on in this world. I married my sweetheart, even got a little baby girl. I wish you could see her, I swear she looks just like you. If you can hear me, show me a sign, please send her a butterfly or two </segment1>
		<segment2>chorus: Im thinking about forever (missing you). I know youre so much better (we made it through) </segment2>
		<segment3>Now I know what it means to live for someone else. To give up yourself. Things have changed, at times it gets kind of strange. Your love remains the same. Do I make you proud? Mama, can you see me now?. Whatever is good in me is because you showed me how to take love by the hand. And so now I can share you with my baby. So that she can understand </segment3>
		<segment4>chorus </segment4>
		<segment5>ending chorus: Im thinking about forever (missing you). I know youre so much better (we made it through). Im thinking about forever (missing you). Im tripping on whatever (hearing you).     </segment5>
