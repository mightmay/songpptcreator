		<segment1>The first one there when I was lost, He was there to help me out. And all this time you tried so hard. Not hard enough. It's something you feel. It'll help you understand. I feel it beat inside my soul, like a pounding knock at the door. Heavy pressure in my head. Your word remains when I'm dead. Melody, energy, Your wisdom follows me. When I feel I' m in need I see your truth. It's something you feel. It'll help you understand. I feel it beat inside my soul, like a pounding knock at the door. Heavy pressure in my head. Your word remains when I'm dead.    </segment1>
