		<segment1>we all fall sometimes. we all let ourselves down. sometimes there's nothing left. but to live with what's been done. and know you're not the only one who falls </segment1>
		<segment2>we all fail sometimes. we all let someone down. sometimes there's nothing left. but to promise to ourselves. that next time we won't be the one to fail </segment2>
		<segment3>i want to tell you you can go on. that beginnings come from ends. i still believe in you and so does God. He's the one who still believes in those who fail. He's the one who still believes in us who fall    </segment3>
