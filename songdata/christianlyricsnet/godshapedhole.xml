		<segment1>All around the world people are trying. Deserted souls cry to be filled. Spirits left undone their hearts are hollow. I can see, in their eyes, hollow lives.</segment1>
		<segment2>And every heart, and every soul. and everybody's got a God-shaped hole.</segment2>
		<segment3>You may have tried to fill that hole inside. with an empty hand you reached in vain. Substitutes don't work, bandages only hurt. The only thing that heals is the hand of God.</segment3>
		<segment4>Nobody's meant to be left all alone. Our lives are much too short. to have an empty soul.    </segment4>
