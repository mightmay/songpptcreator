		<segment1>Sometimes I feel like I am so far away. I'm lost inside my thoughts and I don't know what to say. I know I need you now more every day. I push I pull I run so far away</segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm sick and tired of living this way. Sick and tired of being alone. Sick and tired of running from your love </segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes I feel like I am so far away. I'm lost inside my mind won't you help me find my way. And I know I need you now more every day. I push I pull I run so far away</segment3>
		<segment4>Well I'm sick sick sick and tired baby    </segment4>
