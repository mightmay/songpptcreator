		<segment1>i laid the night before me. unraveled the tangles of my heart. all i felt was stale hallow air. these streams of uncertainty. they are collapsing upon my mind. torrents fill my veins until i burst. with mistaken guilt and shame. my battered bones. try to keep fighting. against the endless ocean of self defeat. as time goes on. some months are yet to pass. puddles of ink. surround this tired chair. all of my own sorrow has been spilled. into my reflection    </segment1>
