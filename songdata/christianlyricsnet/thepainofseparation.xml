		<segment1>How can I bear this any longer?. Arms stretched out only to hold separation. Take me away. I'm dying inside. Emptied before you. I will fight until the day. When I will see. Sight given to these blind eyes. When will I be taken from this life?. Take what is your. You deserve more than my life.     </segment1>
