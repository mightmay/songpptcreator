		<segment1>Here's to the women abandoned by her husband. Who left her for another woman. And to her children for half the love they've been given. Has left them all of a sudden. Blessed are those who mourn. For they shall receive great comfort. But still i found death seems to bring forth life</segment1>
		<segment2>All your heartaches. All your sufferings. All your trials.. Are Gold</segment2>
		<segment3>Here's to the woman who's left to raise her children. She doesn't know the first thing about how to make a living. And all the birthdays, and ballgames, and. Christmas mornings will never be the same. Blessed are the poor in spirit. For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. But still i found death seems to bring forth life</segment3>
		<segment4>All your sorrows. All your pain. All your trials..are Goldl    </segment4>
