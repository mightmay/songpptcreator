		<segment1>Can I ask one question. Before our lips collide?. Will you still be by my side. When clouds fall from the sky?</segment1>
		<segment2>If it's love then surely it's strong enough. To carry us to bed. Eyes shut with rested heads</segment2>
		<segment3>Tell me that I shouldn't fall for you. Tell me that this happened way too soon</segment3>
		<segment4>Baby, you amaze me. Why would i ever leave. For another one?. We can't stand the same movies and horrible bands. Why would I ever hold hands. With another one?</segment4>
		<segment5>There's no rhyme or reason. For calling up this late. Just like me you're still awake. Watching conan or checking space</segment5>
		<segment6>Your car is blasting. Songs we've stole. Before they hit the shelves. We'll predict how they sell. (And they'll sell.. oh, they'll sell)</segment6>
		<segment7>Baby, you amaze me. Why would i ever leave. For another one?. We can't stand the same movies and horrible bands. Why would I ever hold hands. With another one?</segment7>
		<segment8>You have this smile (i'm lucky to be yours). That spans for days (for you i will..). I've stayed awake not knowing whether you. Will call me.</segment8>
		<segment9>Tell me that I shouldn't fall for you. Tell me that this happened way to soon. Tell me that I shouldn't fall for you. Oh god I fall for you.     </segment9>
