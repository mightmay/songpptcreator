		<segment1>If you want to find me I'll be. Lost. Lost in your circuitry. The only home for me. Not unlike. Heavenly, pulsating, moistening. Infinite holy mystery. Fear I not. Tear I not. Leave I not. Inside this</segment1>
		<segment2>Horizon lines I know too well</segment2>
		<segment3>Soma, Soma. Running, Running. Down. Soma, Soma. Running, Running. Down (Horizon lines I know too well) (2x)</segment3>
		<segment4>If you want to find me I'll be. Lost. Lost in this sound and. Lost in this dream. That I've lived, I've breathed. (I've lived and I've breathed). This melancholy sadness. This manic extreme</segment4>
		<segment5>Soma, Soma. Running, Running. Down. Soma, Soma. Running, Running. Down (Horizon lines I know too well) (2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>But what if they find us and what if you leave? (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>Are you peaking yet?. Soaring, defying. The height. The valley. The imminent gravity</segment7>
		<segment8>All I wanna do is just stay here with you (2x)</segment8>
		<segment9>What if they find us and. What if you leave?. You're hurting for me. In my ears so perfectly. We're peaking together. In this sonic revelry. Hold me. Hold me. Hold me</segment9>
		<segment10>Soma, Soma. Running, Running. Down. Soma, Soma. Running, Running. Down (Horizon lines I know too well) (2x)</segment10>
		<segment11>All I wanna do is just stay here with you    </segment11>
