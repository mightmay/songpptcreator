		<segment1>Loud against my face. The tired awake. I walked denied. The tombstone swayed. I feel soaked with blood. These all smell my flesh. The crowds are calling. Calling me. The crowds are calling me. These are the lies. They run from this. I cannot look, want to collapse.</segment1>
		<segment2>The Calling. The Calling</segment2>
		<segment3>My sheltered minds theyre coming down. They come again. Down.</segment3>
		<segment4>Loud against my face. The tired awake. I walked denied. The tomb swayed.    </segment4>
