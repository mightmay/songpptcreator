		<segment1>Yes, youve been on my mind. Ive been drifting for quite some time. And this life is paralyzing. This life is paralyzing me. I cant see through the grays. Truth has been lost in the haze. And I need someone to save me. Truths all I want, all I want is You. Youre all I want, all I want, all I want</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Cause theres black and theres white. And theres wrong and theres right. I cant go one more night. Without telling You that I am sorry. For all of the pain that Ive caused. Ive been gone for so long. Without telling You that I am sorry. Can you hear me. Please forgive me</segment2>
		<segment3>Im screaming through the noise. Tell me You can hear my voice. Cause I am so lost without You. I am so lost without You here. I need some clarity. Need Your spirit leading me. My visions getting blurry. Truths all I want, all I want is You. Truths all I want, all I want, all I want</segment3>
		<segment4>Ive been locked in this maze for so long. Show me the way back home. Open my eyes to see You. Truths all I want, all I want is You. Truths all I want, all I want, all I want</segment4>
		<segment5>Yes, Youve been on my mind. Ive been drifting for quite some time. And this life is paralyzing. This life is paralyzing me    </segment5>
