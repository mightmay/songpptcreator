		<segment1>You are the First and Last. And I can't compare to that. You are the One in stars and the sun. And I can't compare to that. Never could compare to that </segment1>
		<segment2>Still, my reason can sometimes be misplaced. And seasons will hide but You don't change </segment2>
		<segment3>All I can see is vast. And I can't compare to that. You are the One letting me come. And I can't compare to that. Never could compare to that </segment3>
		<segment4>Still, my reason can sometimes be misplaced. And seasons will hide but You don't change </segment4>
		<segment5>My reason can sometimes be misplaced. And seasons will hide but You don't change </segment5>
		<segment6>Feel the bitter and the sweet. You decide to collide into me. Hear the new symphony, yeah </segment6>
		<segment7>It's what I needed. It's what I needed to bring me to see </segment7>
		<segment8>Reason can sometimes be misplaced. And seasons will hide but You don't change </segment8>
		<segment9>My reason can sometimes be misplaced. And seasons will hide but You don't change     </segment9>
