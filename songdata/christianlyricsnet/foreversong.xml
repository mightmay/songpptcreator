		<segment1>She loved the flowers in her room. They helped eased that pain deep inside of her. And even though she could not move. Her presence lifted the universe</segment1>
		<segment2>And sometimes she'd had dreams. She was soaring over golden streets. What did they mean?. I asked her. And she smiled as she said</segment2>
		<segment3>I know heaven waits for me. So don't you shed a tear. We'll live eternally. I'll be waiting for you there</segment3>
		<segment4>I never knew her in this world. But I heard her voice in her written words. And even as the years unfurl. My faith is nothing compared to hers</segment4>
		<segment5>And sometimes she'd had dreams. She was soaring over golden streets. What did they mean?. I asked her. And she smiled as she said</segment5>
		<segment6>I know heaven waits for me. So don't you shed a tear. We'll live eternally. I'll be waiting for you</segment6>
		<segment7>I know heaven waits for me. So don't you shed a tear. We'll live eternally. I'll be waiting</segment7>
		<segment8>And everything is perfect. And there's no more pain. And no more tears. I've seen it in my dreams. I have heard that singing in my ears. the forever song</segment8>

		<segment11>I know heaven waits for me. So don't you shed a tear. We'll live eternally. I'll be waiting for you there    </segment11>
