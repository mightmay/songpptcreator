		<segment1>There's just two ways to lose yourself in this life. And neither way is safe. In my dreams I see visions of the future. But today we have today </segment1>
		<segment2>And where will I find You?. And where will I find You? </segment2>
		<segment3>In the economy of mercy. I am a poor and begging man. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins. In the colors of Your goodness. In the scars that mark Your skin. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins </segment3>
		<segment4>These carbon shells. These fragile dusty frames. House canvases of souls. We are bruised and broken masterpieces. But we did not paint ourselves </segment4>
		<segment5>And where will i find you?. Where will i find you? </segment5>
		<segment6>In the economy of mercy. I am a poor and begging man. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins. In the colors of Your goodness. In the scars that mark your skin. In the currency of grace. Is where my song begins </segment6>
		<segment7>Where was I when the world was made?. Where was I when the world was made?. Where was I when the world was made?. Where was I? </segment7>
		<segment8>I'm lost without You here. Yes, Im lost without You here. I'm lost without You here. You knew my name when the world was made    </segment8>
