		<segment1>hey, so how does it go?. your face doesn't show. me whether or not you know. stop and back up again. this mess that youre in.. is it over?. i heard all about everything. i felt in the way. i heard all about everything. will you be ok?. so, you're spinning your wheels, go dig in your heels, don't mind the burning rubber. no use losing your tread. while losing your head, shift to neutral. sooner or later you'll be fine. as long as you stop now to question why. now what to do only you decide. will you try?. now that you're here. is the coast clear?    </segment1>
