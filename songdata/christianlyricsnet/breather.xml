		<segment1>When the question never set before me. Can I feel it out once more. You are my full ambition. I walked on water. I'm sick of talking now</segment1>
		<segment2>I want You by my side. So close that I can feel You breathing. I won't turn my head, be misguided. I need a breather</segment2>
		<segment3>You take my breath away. You take my breath away (2x)</segment3>
		<segment4>Stay here just enough to catch me when I'm falling</segment4>
		<segment5>You fill me up just like a big balloon of helium. Can't get enough I want some more come on and fill me up. When I'm with You there ain't no other place I'd rather be. I just open up and receive Him. and He set me free    </segment5>
