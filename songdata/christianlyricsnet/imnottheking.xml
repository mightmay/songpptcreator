		<segment1>The king of rock, some say lives. the lizard king is surely dead. the king of France lost his head. the King of Kings bled </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm not the King I just sing. I'm just a fraction of a thing. I am not anything without the King of Kings </segment2>
		<segment3>If I were King I'd be unwise. for my brains aren't King size. a King's someone to trust and love. like Jesus Christ whom I sing of    </segment3>
