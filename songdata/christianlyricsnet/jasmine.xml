		<segment1>It has been way too long since back when. Jasmine Ive been wrong. Ive been wrong about nothing</segment1>
		<segment2>Youre still the same, I wish you changed. Its still your game by your rules. And I will never learn nothing. And nothing ever changes</segment2>
		<segment3>Youre asking me to go to an ordinary, satisfactory. Almost paradise</segment3>
		<segment4>Staying round you. Hanging round you Jasmine. With the sound of our straws. Sipping down Yoohoo</segment4>
		<segment5>You tantalize, I fantasize. And in your eyes is the world. When all else fades into nothing. Im the proof youre beautiful. When youre aloof I get dumb. And I cant think about nothing else. And nothing ever changes</segment5>
		<segment6>Youre asking me to go to an ordinary, satisfactory. Almost paradise</segment6>
		<segment7>Staying round you. Hanging round you Jasmine. With the sound of our straws. Sipping down Yoohoo</segment7>
		<segment8>Loves a beehive of honey and stings. And I dont care if I never learn nothing</segment8>
		<segment9>Staying round you. Hanging round you Jasmine. With the sound of our straws. Sipping down Yoohoo</segment9>
		<segment10>And I dont want anyone else. To mesmerize me, Jasmine    </segment10>
