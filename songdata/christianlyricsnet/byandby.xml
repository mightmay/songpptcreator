		<segment1>See those shoulders bend all weighted by the thought. One more day to carry on, now, carry on. Trouble she cannot shake. Dreams she would like to take her away, away </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: I'll be waiting for the Son to rise. So i can start again by and by. I'll be looking o'er my head to the sky. See the clouds open wide reveal my faith. Mercy me, who do you say I am?. Do I not love you, did I not nail a hand. Trouble I cannot take, Dreams I would like to take you away, away </segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS </segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE: Let the words of my mouth adore You. Next time out, o i'm gonna let it fly. Although my dreams may be tattered. My will, my heart battered. I know You will hear my cry </segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS </segment5>
