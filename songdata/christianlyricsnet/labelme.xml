		<segment1>I'll take the pain for all you do, Anything to become your best friend, Always waiting with open arms, Only to run into rock solid hearts.</segment1>
		<segment2>Moff me, Scoff me, Beat me, Kill me,</segment2>
		<segment3>Give myself to all under a Dogwood tree, Treat me how you like, I don't care you see, I'll treat you the same no matter what you label me.</segment3>
		<segment4>All I want to do is love you, Give me a chance to get inside of you, I would only give up my only kid, Just to help you spend forever with me, yah!</segment4>
		<segment5>Try me once you'll be back for more, I'll change your life when i knock on your door, Once your booked you can tell about it, Then we'll get 'em all on it no one wants to quit.</segment5>
		<segment6>Moff me, Scoff me, Beat me, Kill me,</segment6>
		<segment7>Give myself to all under a Dogwood tree, Treat me how you like, I don't care you see, I'll treat you the same no matter what you label me, yee-ah!</segment7>
		<segment8>All I want to do is love you, Give me a chance to get inside of you, I would only give up my only kid, Just to help you spend forever with me!     </segment8>
