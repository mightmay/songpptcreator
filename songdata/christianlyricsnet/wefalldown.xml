		<segment1>Cursing every step of the Way, he bore a heavy load. To the market ten miles away, The journey took its toll. And every day he passed a Monastery's high cathedral Walls. And it made his life seem Meaningless and small </segment1>
		<segment2>And he wondered how it would Be to live in such a place. To be warm, well fed and at Peace; to shut the world away </segment2>
		<segment3>So when he saw a priest who Walked, for once, beyond the Iron gate. He said, Tell me of your life Inside the place.. And the priest replied.. </segment3>
		<segment4>We fall down, we get up. We fall down, we get up. We fall down, we get up. And the saints are just the Sinners. Who fall down and get up </segment4>
		<segment5>Disappointment followed him Home; he'd hoped for so much More. But he saw himself in a light He had never seen before </segment5>
		<segment6>Cause if the priest who fell Could find the Grace of God To be enough. Then there must be some hope For the rest of us. There must be some hope left For us</segment6>
		<segment7>We fall down, we get up. We fall down, we get up. We fall down, we get up. And the saints are just the Sinners. Who fall down and get up    </segment7>
