		<segment1>Well she is waking up and she is finding out she has no pulse. Just like her God that she is trying to sell, but she ain't bought. Her lion is scared because he is finding out she's waking up and he can't stop breaking down and fading out as she gets up. Well. She looks around, Ariel you have no pulse. Much like your religion, but it is fine. Just fake it. The wrath of God's grace is but an ocean to a child.     </segment1>
