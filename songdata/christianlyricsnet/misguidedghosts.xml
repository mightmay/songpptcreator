		<segment1>I'm going away for a while. But I'll be back, don't try and follow me. 'Cause I'll return as soon as possible. See I'm trying to find my place. But it might not be here where I feel safe. We all learn to make mistakes</segment1>
		<segment2>And run. From them, from them. With no direction. We'll run from them, from them. With no conviction</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts. Traveling endlessly. Don't need no road. In fact they follow me</segment3>
		<segment4>And we just go in circles</segment4>
		<segment5>Well Now I'm told that this is life. And pain is just a simple compromise. So we can get what we want out of it. Would someone care to classify, A broken heart and twisted minds. So I can find someone to rely on</segment5>
		<segment6>And run. To them, to them. Full speed ahead. Oh you are not, Useless. We are just</segment6>
		<segment7>Misguided ghosts. Traveling endlessly. The ones we trusted the most. Pushed us far away. And there's no one road. We should not be the same. But I'm just a ghost. And still they echo me</segment7>
		<segment8>They echo me in circles    </segment8>
