		<segment1>Verse 1. Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away. Slain for us and we remember. The promise made that all who come in faith. Find forgivness at the cross</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. So we share in this bread of life. And we drink of His sacrifice. As a sign of our bonds of peace. Around the table of the King</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2. The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ. Torn for you eat and remember. The wounds that heal the death that brings us life. Paid the price to make us one</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 3. The blood that cleanses ev'ry stain of sin. Shed for you drink and rmember. He drained death's cup that all may enter in. To receive the life of God</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 4. And so with thankfulness and faith we rise. To respond and to remember. Our call to follow in the steps of Christ. As his body here on earth    </segment5>
