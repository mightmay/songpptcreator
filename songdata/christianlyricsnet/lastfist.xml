		<segment1>what are you about. say something secret. in an old order hush. trouble and suffering in a lovely rhythm. a homespun clapboard blackstrap thrush</segment1>
		<segment2>devoted loyal. undertake the toil. beware of what come natural. undertake the spoil. in a fist</segment2>
		<segment3>it was cruel. and it came all too natural. as a younger child. a headstrong folklore strawrifle crutch. thresh a crop defiles</segment3>
		<segment4>in a fist full of sand. it came natural in a fist. full of land.     </segment4>
