		<segment1>The years have gone by fast. Oh how we have grown. The time werent always easy. But hearts and minds revive. Now thoughts of you consume me and I wanted you to know. Youre the brightest shining star Ive ever seen. Oh how blessed we to share in everything. Life before was cold, cold and empty. Every time I see your face Im reminded. Of what it means to be alive</segment1>
		<segment2>The miles will pull apart. And I will not lose sight of the gift that Ive been handed. Been blessed so much but why?. I feel so undeserving but I wanted you to know</segment2>
		<segment3>Youre the brightest shining star Ive ever seen. Oh how blessed we to share in everything. Life before was cold, cold and empty. Every time I see your face Im reminded. Of what it means to be alive</segment3>
		<segment4>All for you. It makes me want to try!. All for you. To give you everything. All for you. It makes me want to try!. All for you. Ill honor you forever. Like a sun that never sets. The brightest shining star</segment4>
		<segment5>Youre the brightest shining star Ive ever seen. Oh how blessed we to share in everything. Life before was cold, cold and empty. Every time I see your face Im reminded. Of what it means to be alive    </segment5>
