		<segment1>she knows that im waiting by the door. I know that shes trying to cover up staring at the floor. Lets Go! Dont say maybe. Forget everyone around lets together and get down. I know its sounds crazy 1, 2, 3 times a lady. Oh no, I've got the notion. Lets get together and start the commotion. round and round til everyone stops. 'til the next needle on the record player stops. It's almost time to say our goodbyes and get home tonight. Lets do it up one more time. Show these people what we had in mind.    </segment1>
