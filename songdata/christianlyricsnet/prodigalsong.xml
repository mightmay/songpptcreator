		<segment1>Henry loves the ballpark. But lately he aint coming round. Things have been so different. Since his youngest boy left town</segment1>
		<segment2>Fighting seem so harmless. Families sometimes disagree. Its hard to know the reason. Why he finally chose to leave. But hes gone away. And his father waits</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. And he is watching and he is hoping. Though his eyes are weary, his arms are still open. And his prayer, so softly spoken. Please come home</segment3>
		<segment4>Now Henry sits and wonders. In that front porch rocking chair. Does his boy remember. All the love the family shared. And is he cold. Out there alone</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus:]. And he is watching and he is hoping. Though his eyes are weary, his arms are still open. And his prayer, so softly spoken. Please come home</segment5>
		<segment6>To your seat at the table. To your father who weeps. Every night in sleepless dreams. He longs to see. His face in younger skin. Running down the driveway again.    </segment6>
