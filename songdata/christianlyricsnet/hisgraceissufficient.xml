		<segment1>I've exhausted every possible solution, I've tried every last game there is to play. In this search for the Christ like perfection. I'm convinced I've only left my God ashamed. I cry I wonder can he hear my despair. Afraid to lift my hands afraid he doesn't care. </segment1>
		<segment2>And if he answers and I fall again. can I still be his daughter can I still depend on him. When I'm down search every mistake, looking for new regrets. sometimes I forget, I forget that his grace is sufficient for me. that it's deeper and wider than I can conceive. </segment2>
		<segment3>His Grace is sufficient for me. My convictions seem to fade with desperation, my hope declines with each and every tear. My sin an anchor and this grace just an illusion. </segment3>
		<segment4>The gavels heavy and justice is near. Up comes the light and finds the stains on my hands. Up comes my pride, I hide, I know he won't understand. Cause it's deeper than deep and it's wider then wide. why did I ever doubt now I'm dying inside. (chorus).</segment4>
		<segment5>His Grace is sufficient! </segment5>
		<segment6>    </segment6>
