		<segment1>(Ohhh, get funky). Souls black as night. But it's nothing for the children of God to fight. We wrestle not with flesh and blood. But with the principalities of darkness. So put on your armor of God. For the day of battle will come. But the victory is already ours. Through Christ in the power of one. The Power, of Christ. The Power</segment1>
		<segment2>Surrounded by the angels of God. Step to the realm where evil reigns. We are soldiers prepared for war. With the power to speak his name. Satan with his legion of demons. Deceiving with his wicked ways. With his life he has paid. With his word I will slay. Any demon that steps in my way. So bring it on. Bring it on</segment2>
		<segment3>It's the P.O.D. on the mic rockin' the set. In case you didn't know Payable On Death. Making suckers drop, kick'n non stop. The hard rock'n thrash, with a little hip hop. Four christian brothers here we go, on a roll. Coming up hard, but you know we got soul. I'm strapped, yes we're packed, and it's about time. 'cause Jesus got my back P.O.D.'s on the frontline</segment3>
		<segment4>Three in the power of one, three in the power of one. Three in the power of one, three in the power of one. Three in the power of one, three in the power of one. Three in the power of one, three in the power of one.     </segment4>
