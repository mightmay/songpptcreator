		<segment1>I am more than this flesh and bone. By myself I wander the streets alone. But when my dream is over and morning creeps on in. I pull the covers back and I feel your warmth again</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). There is something inside. That I can't explain. But by the grace of God. I am made whole again. In the times I have fallen. And when I felt the shame. Yet by the grace of God. I am made whole again. In the times I have fallen. And when I felt the shame. Yet by the grace of God. I am made whole again</segment2>
		<segment3>Sold in my pride I said I know. So I bought the lie and chained my soul. But mercy runs deep and seeks to fill. An empty well of shadow that. One day will reveal</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)    </segment4>
