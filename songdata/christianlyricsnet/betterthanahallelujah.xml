		<segment1>God loves a lullaby. In a mothers tears in the dead of night. Better than a Hallelujah sometimes. God loves the drunkards cry, The soldiers plea not to let him die. Better than a Hallelujah sometimes. </segment1>
		<segment2>We pour out our miseries. God just hears a melody. Beautiful the mess we are. The honest cries of breaking hearts. Are better than a Hallelujah. </segment2>
		<segment3>The woman holding on for life, The dying man giving up the fight. Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes. The tears of shame for what's been done, The silence when the words won't come. Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes. </segment3>
		<segment4>Better than a church bell ringing, Better than a choir singing out, singing out.    </segment4>
