		<segment1>I'll break my vow of silence</segment1>
		<segment2>Because I am what you told me you are. Because you showed me your unhealed scar. Revealed and died in your own eyes. Relieved me to see my own lies</segment2>
		<segment3>Through the years it has become darker in that secret place. His light pierced this lonely chamber through you. And the truth shall set you free. I'll remember your truth that set me free from it getting. Darker and darker in that secret place</segment3>
		<segment4>It came flying through the air like a beautiful shadow made me turn my head. The taste of danger is sweet I've always known. but still allowed this to be my bread. Evil crow lands on my head, I let it stay. Whispers so I think only I can hear it and I obey</segment4>
		<segment5>Who would think that so much beauty would come from such horrible truth. Because I am what you told me you are. Because you showed me your unhealed scar</segment5>
		<segment6>Tongue too ashamed to even pronounce it right. I spoke but kept it in me with ropes so tight. This is my fight, the word was spoken and I got my sight</segment6>
		<segment7>Promise so glad I wasn't able to keep. Words formed by your soul is my reflection. Lie was bound to my heart to keep. Broken chains through your confession    </segment7>
