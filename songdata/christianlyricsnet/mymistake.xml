		<segment1>I broke everything we had. There's no fixing what went bad. So many fatal mistakes</segment1>
		<segment2>I broke every single rule. And I don't think they've made a tool. To fix all my mistakes</segment2>
		<segment3>When I said good bye. And brought a tear to your eye. That was my mistake</segment3>
		<segment4>When I told you to go. Cause I just didn't know. That was my mistake</segment4>
		<segment5>I broke down inside my mind. I thought that I was doing fine. I'm so hard on myself</segment5>
		<segment6>I broke everything I built. And now I'm living with the guilt. At least I have my health</segment6>
		<segment7>(CHORUS)</segment7>
		<segment8>Time will heal, bruises fade. Life will change the plans we've made. If we face the truth and be our best. There's no need to worry about the rest</segment8>
		<segment9>(CHORUS)    </segment9>
