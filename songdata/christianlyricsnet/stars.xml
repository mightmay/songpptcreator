		<segment1>you should see the stars tonight. how they shimmer shine so bright. against the black they look so white. comin down from such a height. to reach me now, reach me now</segment1>
		<segment2>you should see the moon in the flight. cuttin cross the misty night. softly dancin in sunshine. reflections of this light. reach me now, you reach me now</segment2>
		<segment3>and how could such a thing. shine its light on me. and make everything beautiful again</segment3>
		<segment4>and you should feel the sun in the spring. comin out after a rain. suddenly all is green. sunshine on everything. i can feel it now, i feel you now</segment4>
		<segment5>and how could such a thing. shine its light on me. and make everything beautiful</segment5>
		<segment6>and you should hear the angels sing. all gathered round their king. more beautiful than you could dream. i've been quietly listening. you can hear 'em now, i hear em now</segment6>
		<segment7>and how could such a king. shine His light on me. and make everything beautiful. and i wanna shine. i wanna be light. i wanna tell you it'll be alright. and i wanna shine and i wanna fly. just to tell you now. it'll be alright, it'll be alright. it'll be alright.</segment7>
		<segment8>cus i got nothing of my own to give to you. but this light that shines on me shines on you. and makes everything beautiful, again. it'll be alright, it'll be alright.    </segment8>
