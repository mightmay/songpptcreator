		<segment1>The Levites returned with the Ark of the Land. The presence and strength of the God they adored. The temple was shut with the gatekeepers near. The priests would sing out till their nation could hear</segment1>
		<segment2>Be lifted up everlasting doors. The King of Glory shall come in. Who is this King of Glory?. The Lord strong and mighty. Open your gates to the Lord of Hosts. Who is this King of Glory?. The Lord mighty in battle. The King of Glory shall come in. The King of Glory shall come in</segment2>
		<segment3>Who can ascend to the hill of the Lord. Those with clean hands and an innocent heart. Who can be found in His holy place. Those who are humble and seek his face</segment3>
		<segment4>Now we are the temple, He dwells in our hearts. The priesthood of faith that His Spirit imparts. This King is the One who can save from sin. He stands at the door and He wants to come in     </segment4>
