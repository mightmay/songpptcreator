		<segment1>How shallow have we become?. Wrapped up in pointless strife. Watching each other with this disgust and selfish pride, waiting and hoping for our brothers to fall. What's happened to make us fade, what happened to make us this way. Lord take our wounded wings away, we are not worthy of your grace, shameful hearts and jealous tongues are breaking your heart, breaking your heart again. It's time to make this right. It's time to set this ablaze. It's time to make a difference, It's time to make a change, pick up these broken. Pieces and get back to our faith. Lord take our wounded wings away, we are not worthy of your grace, shameful hearts and jealous tongues are breaking your heart, breaking your heart again. United by faith we will not fall away. United by faith, we will not fall    </segment1>
