		<segment1>When all I have is this, is it enough?. When all I do is feel for you, can you hear me?. When all the voices say it isn't enough. When all I do is wonder why, can you meet me? </segment1>
		<segment2>Won't you hold me? Won't you hold me?. Won't you take me when I am lonely?. 'Cause you know me, 'cause you know me. And you love me, and you keep me </segment2>
		<segment3>When time and ages pass, is it enough?. The moment's gone and all I have is you, can you hear me?. When all I am is true, am I enough?. The fragile flesh to hold its sacred name, can you see me? </segment3>
		<segment4>Won't you hold me? Won't you hold me?. Won't you take me when I am lonely?. 'Cause you know me, 'cause you know me. And you love me, and you keep me </segment4>
		<segment5>Won't you hold me? Won't you hold me?. (So take me in, Your promises come true). Won't you take me when I am lonely?. (And echoes of the one I love, again you whisper). 'Cause you know me, 'cause you know me. (So take me in, Your promises come true). And you love me, and you keep me. (And echoes of the one I love, again you whisper) </segment5>
		<segment6>Won't you hold me (So take me there)     </segment6>
