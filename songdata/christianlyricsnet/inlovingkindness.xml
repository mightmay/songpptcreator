		<segment1>We are a new creation. the old has gone, the new has come. Reconciled us to Himself Through Christ Jesus. We will be free, forever knowing what will become of us. Thank you for the cross. Trusting in the balance. Has tilted me toward righteousness. Lifting my spirit once again. Sinking not in my functioning Inhale, exhale this over and over again. Looking for tomorrow forgetting about today. Striving to tell them the truth. Dying, dying, dead Through prayer and sacrifice into all the earth. With love and understanding. Now I look to importance. Standing here steadfast. To renew the spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence. Or take Your Holy Spirit from me.    </segment1>
