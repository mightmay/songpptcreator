		<segment1>He's washing his face to start his day. He's lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely. Nothing in the mirror ever shows him what's within. Now he's checking out the faces on the back of the milk. He's sour under all this pressure. He thinks the missing person looks an awful lot like him </segment1>
		<segment2>And he starts his engine. But he knows he's missing gears </segment2>
		<segment3>Incomplete. Where will you find yourself?. Incomplete. Where will you find yourself?. 'Cause you're the missing person now. Step outside your doubts and let yourself be found </segment3>
		<segment4>He's sick of the race to just save face. He's tired and tried, he's sick and tired. He's tired of the holes that are keeping him incomplete. He'll push the pedal to the floor like the day before. He's trying to be always trying. Try to find an end to justify his means </segment4>
		<segment5>So he starts his engine. But he knows he's missing gears </segment5>
		<segment6>Incomplete. Where will you find yourself?. Incomplete. Where will you find yourself?. 'Cause you're the missing person now. Step outside the doubts and let yourself be found </segment6>
		<segment7>So he starts his engine. But he knows that he's missing gears </segment7>
		<segment8>Incomplete. Where will you find yourself?. Incomplete. Where will you lose yourself?. 'Cause you're the missing person now. Step outside your doubts and let yourself be found. And let yourself be found and let yourself be found     </segment8>
