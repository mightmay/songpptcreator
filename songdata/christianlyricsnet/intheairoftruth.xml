		<segment1>I'm waiting for You. Until you give my spirit wings. I'm waiting for You. Until winter breaks into spring</segment1>
		<segment2>In the air of truth I held up my bruised spirit. For everybody to see. So no one can drag me away from this place. Before You heal it. For my soul to breathe only before thee</segment2>
		<segment3>Let me hear it once again. Silent thunder shake me. I will wait forever if that's what it takes for me to hear and see. So they can go ahead and say that I swallowed the bait. And I'll still sick around Your precious voice, yes I will wait</segment3>
		<segment4>So let me glow like I was new. Pure as if this was where it all should have begun. If I could I would give more then I have to You. As I've walked this night. Your hand guides the morning sun</segment4>
		<segment5>A chance to breathe    </segment5>
