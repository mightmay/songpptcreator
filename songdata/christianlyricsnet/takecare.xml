		<segment1>I'll take care of you. Have faith that when you call my name I'll be there. It was a strait-faced lie I believed. It was a strait-faced lie you would ever leave me. So for now I'll keep believing your words. Soon enough my strength will return. Let me draw the blinds for you. You can watch the sunset from the bed in your hospital room. Until you're sleeping. and I'm sure that I don't understand how I found a love so pure. Don't lift a finger let me show you the only way to let this go. Don't lift a finger let me hold you here until the pain is all gone.    </segment1>
