		<segment1>Second chances don't come around. What's done is done you should've thought of that. Before you lied down and changed your life in an instant. You're never gonna be the same you're gonna miss it</segment1>
		<segment2>I know you wanted something real. Something that's forever. So tell me how does it feel. That it's gone</segment2>
		<segment3>You gave it all away you didn't even think about it. Gave it all away now there's nothing left to give. I know the years go by but you can't forget. The look in his eyes, broken promises filled with regret. Now you've learned to be strong. You'll never get back now what you lost</segment3>
		<segment4>I know you wanted something real. Something that's forever. So tell me how does it feel. That it's gone</segment4>
		<segment5>You gave it all away you didn't even think about it. Gave it all away for the moment. You gave it all away now there's nothing left to say about it. You gave it all away now there's nothing left to give</segment5>
		<segment6>So give it back what you've taken from me. Cause I don't want to live with this insanity</segment6>
		<segment7>You gave it all away you didn't even think about it. Gave it all away for the moment. You gave it all away now there's nothing left to say about it. Gave it all away now there's nothing left to give    </segment7>
