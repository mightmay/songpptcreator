		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on Proverbs 14:12, Ephesians 6:6, Galatians 1:10, 1 Thessalonians 4:1, Matthew 6:2, 25:23, Colossians 3:23</segment1>
		<segment2>So many voices telling me which way to go. So many choices come from those who think they know. There's a way that seems right to a man. But it only brings him death. I wanna go the way that leads to life. Till I draw my dying breath </segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). Don't wanna be a manpleaser - I wanna be a Godpleaser. I just want to have the wisdom to discern the two apart. Don't wanna be a manpleaser - I wanna be a Godpleaser. I just want to do the things that please the Father's heart </segment3>
		<segment4>Some make a sacrifice and never let it show. Some make a point of letting everybody know. Some will live their lives as unto men. And they have their reward. I just wanna do everything I do. With my heart unto the Lord </segment4>
		<segment5>I just want my life to glorify His Son. To make my Father proud that I'm His child before I'm done. No need to pat me on the back or stop the shake my hand. I just want to hear my Father say &quot;Well done, well done&quot;. I just want to hear my Father say &quot;Well done&quot;    </segment5>
