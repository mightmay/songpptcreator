		<segment1>So life is different than what they show us on TV. Do dreams come true for everyone or just for Barbie. And I've been waiting here so very patiently. Well it's been so long it's been too long. I wonder what's wrong with me </segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna know how to live in the real world. I wanna know cause I'm a real live girl </segment2>
		<segment3>I wanna live in TV land with Mr T and the A-team. My problems they could solve before the end of the show. I wanna live in TV land where they're SO thin and pretty. They must be nice people cause they're on 90210. In TV land </segment3>
		<segment4>I wish I looked like all the nice actors on TV. Sometimes you've got to choose between real and plastic surgery. Just like the people on the television screen. Barbie's not a role model she's only make believe </segment4>
		<segment5>I wanna know how to live in the real world. I wanna know cause I'm a real live girl </segment5>
		<segment6>I wanna live in TV land and be one of Charlie's angels. It must be fun to fight crime and have new clothes for every Show. I wanna live in TV land like Samantha or Dream of jeannie. My problems I could solve by wrinkling my nose. In TV land </segment6>
		<segment7>I wanna live in TV Land we can change the world through the TV. Show all kinds of people like we have in the real world. I wanna live in TV land make it safe to be ordinary. Gonna do my own show it's all about us real live girls. In TV land.     </segment7>
