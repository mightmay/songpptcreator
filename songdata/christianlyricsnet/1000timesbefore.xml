		<segment1>You've opened yourself up this time. You don't know what to do, or where to go. You wanted to be everything to someone you couldn't trust. Is this where you want your life to go?. Here you go again, walking down this path you've seen a thousand times before. Here you go again, telling yourself the same old lies you've told a thousand times before. And know you shut yourself off. Closed the door to reason. It's time to take a look at your self, through honest eyes. Give yourself that chance. Here you go again, walking down this path you've seen a thousand times before. Here you go again, telling yourself the same old lies you've told a thousand times before.     </segment1>
