		<segment1>Eternal God, unchanging. Mysterious and unknown. Your boundless love unfailing. In grace and mercy shown. Bright seraphim in ceaseless flight. Around your glorious throne. Their voices raised both day and night. In praise to you alone </segment1>
		<segment2>Hallelujah!. Glory be to our great God. Hallelujah!. Glory be to our great God! </segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, we are weak and frail, Helpless in the storm. Surround us with your angels. Hold us in your arms. Our cold and ruthless enemy. His pleasure is our harm. Rise up, oh Lord, and he will flee. Before our Sovereign God </segment3>
		<segment4>Hallelujah!. Glory be to our great God!. Hallelujah!. Glory be to our great God! </segment4>
		<segment5>Let every creature in the sea. And every flying bird. Let all the mountains, all the fields. And valleys of the earth. Let all the moons and all the stars. Throughout the universe. Sing praises to the Living God. Who rules them by His word </segment5>
		<segment6>Hallelujah!. Glory be to our great God. Hallelujah!. Glory be to our great God!    </segment6>
