		<segment1>My heart has never been enough. Breathing just barely gets me by. For a time. The consequences of being human won't be undone by human hands. I turn my head and see it all falling apart. But You're still here, un-phased by me. I'm holding on. I'm holding on to you. I move my eyes from fixation on a fallen world. I'm holding onto you, un-phased by me. These walls fall down around me but I will stand. And though my body be burned away I will live. Life    </segment1>
