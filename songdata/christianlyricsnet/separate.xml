		<segment1>I know this is hard for you. This is something I must go through. The first step of the long march. The hardest step, we must depart. I will return with more love and more hate. For the distance that makes us separate. Pulling me down past the point of comfort. I wish i could hold her, stand with her. And i know it's not over. Every minute is a minute closer. I will come back to hold. 'Till the day that we grow old.     </segment1>
