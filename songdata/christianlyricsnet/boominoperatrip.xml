		<segment1>BoominÂ’. I've been around the way. I've been around the block. I got the keys to the city if the gates are locked. And a freak like me ain't 'bout to stop. I got a hand full of dreams and a heart full of God</segment1>
		<segment2>Everywhere we go they wonder where we're from. Well its diverse city ya'll welcome to come. It sits high on a hill you can see it for days. And even if you can't you can hear our praise. We go ..</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system. This goes out to anyone listening. Boomin' out the stereo system. Here to rep the most high with this one. Boomin' out the stereo system. This goes out to anyone listening. Boomin' out the stereo system. 'Cause we rock for sure in stereo</segment3>
		<segment4>If you're looking to slide, come slide with us. And if you're looking for a ride, it's a big old bus. We got black folk, white folk and Middle East. Mexican, Filipino - Jesus Freaks. Got a Haitian Princess, an Aussie Mate. East Coast, Midwest to left side of the states. And when the bus rolls, it's out the dirty south. Tennessee and we keepin' it good and loud we go. We go .. 'Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system. This goes out to anyone listening. Boomin' out the stereo system. Here to rep the most high with this one. Boomin' out the stereo system. This goes out to anyone listening. Boomin' out the stereo system. 'Cause we rock for sure in stereo</segment4>
		<segment5>I got portable sounds to lift me up. Portable sounds to take me higher. Portable sounds to lift me up. So don't even try to get in my head. I got portable sounds to lift me up. Portable sounds to take me higher. Portable sounds to lift me up. So don't even try to get in my head. I got portable sounds to lift Us up. Portable sounds to take Us higher</segment5>
		<segment6>I got portable sounds to lift Us up. Portable sounds to take Us higher</segment6>
		<segment7>I got portable sounds to lift Us up. Portable sounds to take Us higher</segment7>
		<segment8>I got portable sounds to lift Us up. Portable sounds to take Us higher. 'Cause we're boomin' out the stereo system. This goes out to anyone listening. Boomin' out the stereo system. Here to rep the most high with this one. Boomin' out the stereo system. This goes out to anyone listening. Boomin' out the stereo system. 'Cause we rock for sure in stereo</segment8>
