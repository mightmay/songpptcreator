		<segment4>It doesn't matter what you done. It doesn't matter what you done. What effect is without a cause?. It doesn't matter what you done. Now lay your faithless head down. In necessities cotton hand. There's a love that never changes. No matter what you done</segment4>
		<segment5>If your old man did you wrong (x3). Well maybe his old man did him wrong. If you care to sing forgiveness songs. Come down and join our band. We'll cut you like sword. And sing forgiveness songs</segment5>
		<segment6>Everywhere we look (x5). It's all crazy. It's all false. It's all a dream. It's alright. Everywhere we look     </segment6>
