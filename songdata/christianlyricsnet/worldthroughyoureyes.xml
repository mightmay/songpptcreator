		<segment1>Hear the silence shout, Highest Praise. God to you alone. All creation waits. On Your every word. Where time and heaven meet</segment1>
		<segment2>Let me see forever. With eyes youve opened. Standing in your beautiful light. Hold me near. Hold me near to You. And let me see the world through Your eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>In this perfect hour. I am changed. Ill never be the same. Help me follow You. And keep in time with the sound. Of heaven in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Let me see forever. With eyes Youve opened. Standing in Your beautiful light. Hold me near. Hold me near to You. And let me see the world through Your eyes</segment4>
		<segment5>Hide me in Your love again. Let me hear the songs of Your heart    </segment5>
