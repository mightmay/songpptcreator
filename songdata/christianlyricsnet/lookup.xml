		<segment1>Look up look u..up look up look up. Look up look u..up look up look up. Please. Look up. God will come through but now you gotta. Look u..up. I know it's been rough but hey you gotta. Look up. Tears in your eyes just look to the sky. Look up. You'll find out that He was there all the time. Look up. I know you've been through but sure you've gotta. Look u..up. It's all up to you look to the Father. Look up. So don't miss your chance look to the hills. Look up. And you'll find out Jesus is real. Ooooh. New Orleans. Look up. Camden. Look up. Mississippi. Look up. Everybody. Look up. Your help is right there. Look up</segment1>
