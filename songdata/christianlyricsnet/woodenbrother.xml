		<segment1>we hit the floor. just like her blue silk slip. dark puritan rose. to the curve ofher hip. I did not know. it was too much. too much for me to handle. to be shown to the heart of the matter. by your holy candle</segment1>
		<segment2>the clank of your second hand. the stare of your glass eye. have I no wisdom. that is not wise. in that way we laid the rail. a woven handmade indian. I spoke and understood. your golden virginian</segment2>
		<segment3>still not a day goes by. something always. something always by and by</segment3>
		<segment4>sing the same old song. in the same old way. through mystic maze of memory. our days of disarray. stood still in the same place twice. just to cast a shadow. cast down by a western sun. you have the right to know.     </segment4>
