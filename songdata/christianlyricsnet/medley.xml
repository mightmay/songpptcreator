		<segment2>All I want is love. I confess to this. I will take it, Lord. All You have to give</segment2>
		<segment3>Turn your eyes upon Jesus. Look full in His wonderful face. And the things of Earth. Will grow strangely dim. In the light of His glory and grace</segment3>
		<segment4>And you give yourself away. And you give yourself away. And you give. And you give. And you give yourself away</segment4>
		<segment5>All I want is love. And I confess to this. I will take it, Lord. All You have to give. All You have to give. All You have. All You have to give</segment5>
		<segment6>Your love, oh Lord. Reaches to the heavens. Your faithfulness stretches to the sky. And Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains. Your justice flows like the ocean's tides</segment6>
