		<segment1>Hangin' on a string. Walking a tightrope. I've been relying on myself for far too long. Livin' on my own. And thinking I'd cope. Why'd I put You on the shelf. Oh i was wrong</segment1>
		<segment2>Livin' on good intentions. Never got me very far. Only with Your direction. Can I get to where You are</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). Home again. I've been gone way to long. Home again. I don't want to roam no more. I'm where I belong</segment3>
		<segment4>I must have thought. Dreaming again out of habit. Something bout tryin to get myself ahead. Led to want it all. Then remembering I had it. I've been down that road. And won't go back again</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus).     </segment5>
