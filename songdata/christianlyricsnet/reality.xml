		<segment1>Every now and then. I need some time to myself. I need some time to think. So I can breathe</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause out here in the world. You know some things will never change. You're just another number. With a face</segment2>
		<segment3>So don't fool yourself. Into believing what you see. It's only illusions. A prodigy</segment3>
		<segment4>I can feel you running through me. It's in my mind and I'm thinking clearly. I can't tell what it is that you do to me. Just look into my eyes and you will see</segment4>
		<segment5>Reality</segment5>
		<segment6>Through the years I've learned. It's so hard to find. Something to believe in. Peace of mind</segment6>
		<segment7>So don't fool yourself. Into believing what you see. It's only illusions. A prodigy    </segment7>
