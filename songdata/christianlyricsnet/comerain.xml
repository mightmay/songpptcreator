		<segment1>A flower can't change without a drop of rain. It'll only stay the same and fade away. Each hour of every day,I need You here with me. You make me see You're all I need come rain. CHORUS. Come rain on me. Wash all of me away. 'Til only you remain. Come rain. Thank God I can see there's nothing lift of me. It's all been washed away, I'm changed. I fell Your mercy, Your blood it covers me. You make me see You're all I need come rain. I can't explain it. How Your love pours on me. How You make me fell inside. Your truth surrounds me. Your power moves me. Into Your arms    </segment1>
