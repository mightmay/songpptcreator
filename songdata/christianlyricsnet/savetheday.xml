		<segment1>It's raining in my life today. and it won't seem to fade. My heart feels like a ten-pound brick. and I need to hear you say</segment1>
		<segment2>When the world is on my shoulders. When it feels like hope is nowhere. You will save the day. When it feels like life is chaos. You'll be there reminding me that. You will save the day. You will save the day</segment2>
		<segment3>Why do I forget the words. that you spoke to me?. Their ringing in my ear. it's so crystal clear. that you won't leave me</segment3>
		<segment4>So tell it to me once again. Tell me 'til I understand</segment4>
		<segment5>When my face is on the ground. and I'm crying outloud. When there's no one else around. You will save the day     </segment5>
