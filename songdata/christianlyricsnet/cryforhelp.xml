		<segment1>Razor blades and a bottle of pills won't make me change the way that I feel</segment1>
		<segment2>When life gave up on me, I just gave up on life. it spills over your lips and wraps around me. like a gift in fear of temporary placement, on the table we made with the letters we wrote, you are everything so hold on to me, like I hold on to you. I won't learn from my mistakes this time. making the same ones in different years</segment2>
		<segment3>There's no way out, no way out, no way out. no way out, no way out, no way out, no way out, no way out. if I could think of something better than this to say. I'd tell you a story about my princess. or a fairy tale about happiness that lasts, but your beauty was never make believe</segment3>
		<segment4>This is not rock and roll, someone please help me</segment4>
		<segment5>Every time I said it, I felt it every time I didn't say it, I still felt it you are a seal I place on my chest and arm. I'd give you my circle if you'd take it from me and make a promise to me. you still have my promise if I fade away. so place me like a seal on you're chest and arm</segment5>
		<segment6>You love to lie to me, I live to love your lies, I live to love you still, I love to live to die    </segment6>
