		<segment1>Aidan you're young. But Aidan you're growing fast. Me and your mom. And all the love we have. We can only take you so far. As far as we can. But you'll need something more to guide your heart. As you grow into a man</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Let mercy lead. Let love be the strength in your legs. And in every footprint that you leave. There'll be a drop of grace. If we can reach. Beyond the wisdom of this age. Into the foolishness of God. That foolishness will save. Those who believe. Although their foolish hearts may break. They will find peace. And I'll meet you in that place. Where mercy leads</segment2>
		<segment3>Aidan the day. Aidan the day will come. You'll run the race. That takes us way beyond. All our trials and all our failures. And all the good we dream of. But you can't see yet where it is you're heading. But one day you'll see the face of love</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS(2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>Let mercy lead. Let love be the strength in your legs. And in every footprint that you leave. There'll be a drop of grace. If we can reach. Beyond the wisdom of this age. Into the foolishness of God. That foolishness will save. Let mercy lead    </segment5>
