		<segment2>Who's idea was this?. A Christian Floridian rapping white kid. Whoever did must've flipped they lid. He's bugged out he dances like Taylor Hicks. You know you don't fit in. When your own myspace only got 3 friends. It's Tom your mom and a dude named Ben. And I don't even know how I added him. Yep I aint got no class. Cuz my lights still up and Christmas passed. I go to McDonalds aint got no cash. I just order hot sauce then I walk out fast. I head to Wal-Mart to buy some pants. I gonna wear them all year then take em back. And let me make it real clear on this here track. I'm a do my thing you can't stop that </segment2>

		<segment4>I don't think the kid is well. He sends viruses to his own email. He got 5 text messages all from myself. Saying your wack dude LOL. I really used to keep it real. In my little mini van with the 10 inch wheels. Driving up to side just get my meal. Can I get fries, &quot;sir this is Taco Bell&quot;. So watch out now ya better be careful. He's about to pass out cause I think that his heads full. Off Mountain Dews 10 cans of red bull. With 17 shots of Starbucks espresso. I think I'm stuck in the 80's. But shout outs to all the fellas and ladies. Soccer moms in mini vans, Mercedes. Talking about &quot;KJ so crazy&quot;</segment4>

		<segment6>You know how I roll, yo. Im from Florida, cockroaches, old folks. And I don't fit ya mold tho. All I can say is this is that's what God chose so. When I come thru you be like oh no. Whats he gonna do he's just so so. Aint gotta thing to prove slow ya roll bro. I bring Christ to you nothing more so. Cuz he's just my life's hope. He's the net when I walk on the tightrope. You can bet that he'll catch if I might fall. Life is hard but he's how my life copes. Care less you think if I'm dope. I could have the freshest rhyme flow. I could have the dopest live show. Without him tho it don't mean a thing so bring it.</segment6>
