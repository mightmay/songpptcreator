		<segment1>Yesterday, I found that everything I knew was wrong. It was upside down, the life I thought I had was gone</segment1>
		<segment2>But You came and whispered love to me. And You gave me strength to carry on</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, the sun is shining. There is hope for me again. A new day's dawning, the sun is shining</segment3>
		<segment4>Yesterday, I lost everything I had and loved. Then I cried out for You, Lord. And You came and picked me up</segment4>
		<segment5>And the sorrow lasted through the night. But the joy came with the morn</segment5>
		<segment6>I will lift my voice. No, I won't be silent, for You heard my cry. And You turned my mourning into dancing. And so forever, I'll sing.     </segment6>
