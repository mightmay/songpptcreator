		<segment1>My feet felt light for the first time in months. It was like you came walking across the room. Straight at me and then straight through me. And then stopped and stood still for awhile. I knew then that i'd been lonely for quite some time. And as we started to dance you gently took off my tear soaked coat. And let it fall heavy to the floor and then. We danced some more</segment1>
		<segment2>When all is said and done. When all is gone and still just begun. I will be asked what i did with my time and why. Can you be my alibi. Cause i know i spent it dancing with you</segment2>
		<segment3>I have been here before. These emotions are relived. It's like a joy deja vu. You have been walking along. With me for quite some time. But me with my deaf ear and blind sides. Both of these i turned against you. We all know that you're there. We all know</segment3>
		<segment4>When all is said and done. When all is gone and still just begun. I will be asked what i did with my time and why. Can you be my alibi. Cause i know i spent it dancing with you</segment4>
		<segment5>Said and done. Now all is gone and still just begun. What have i done with my time and why. You are my alibi. Cause i know. I know im dancing with you.     </segment5>
