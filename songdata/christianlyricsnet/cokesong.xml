		<segment1>Caffeine in my system makes me feel so good inside. Yeah it wakes me in the morning. When I take that caffeine ride. I am so thirsty my throats so dry I choke. There is no question and this is no joke. I need some COKE. Looking in the mirror I start jumping all around. Yeah I fear that dreadful moment. when one caffeine high goes down. Its what I need liquid satisfaction. Won't you buy it for me COKE    </segment1>
