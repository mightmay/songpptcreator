		<segment1>Another song about tv. How much tv sucks. Washes your brain of. Intelligence you sit. Around all night and day. Was life really ment to. Be thin way? tv sucks!. Watching your life go. Down the tube and you. Wonder why every day's. A re-run nothing. Different happens. Nothing new your life's a. Show and the show is. Over tv sucks! a waste of. Time of a created mind. Star trek's been airing far. To long can you sleep at. Night without sight and. Sound what ever. Happened to reality? tv. Sucks!.     </segment1>
