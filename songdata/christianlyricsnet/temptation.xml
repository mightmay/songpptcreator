		<segment2>If i could see life (for) as hard as it is. Maybe it would become more real.</segment2>
		<segment3>So many whispers in my head don't know from where they come. Is there an angel's voice and does he have good intetions with me. Or is it a demons voice which wants to lead me anywhere. trying to push me out of my way in this pain again.</segment3>
