		<segment1>We were talking together. I said, What's up with this weather?. Don't know whether or not. How sad I just got. Was on my own volition. Or if I'm just missing the sun</segment1>
		<segment2>And tomorrow I know. Will be rainy at best. And the forecast I know. Is that I'll be depressed. But I'll wait outside. Hoping that I'll catch sight of the sun</segment2>
		<segment3>Because on and off. The clouds have fought for control over the sky. And lately the weather has been so bi-polar. And consequently so have I</segment3>
		<segment4>But now I'm. Sunny with a high of 75. Since you took my heavy heart and made it light. And it's funny how you find you enjoy your life. When you're happy to be alive</segment4>
		<segment5>And the temperature is freezing. And then after dark. There's a cold front. Sweeping in over my heart. And we might break up. If I don't wake up to the sun    </segment5>
