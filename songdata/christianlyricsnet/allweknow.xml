		<segment1>We've tried so hard to understand, but we can't. We held the world out in our hands and you ran away.</segment1>
		<segment2>It takes some time to let you go and it shows.</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause all we know is falling, it falls. Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all.</segment3>
		<segment4>Now we can follow you back home but we won't. Is this what you had waited for? Just to be alone?</segment4>
		<segment5>It takes some time to let you go and it shows.</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause all we know is falling, it falls. Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all.</segment6>
		<segment7>You never, you never said. This wasn't what you wanted, was it? Was it?</segment7>
		<segment8>This isn't what you wanted. This isn't what you wanted.</segment8>
		<segment9>Cause all we know is falling, it falls. Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all.    </segment9>
