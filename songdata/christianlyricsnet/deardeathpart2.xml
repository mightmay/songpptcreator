		<segment1>Time is running out as you die, die, die in this bed not making a sound. It has all come crashing down to the heel, and watch you breathe your last. So helpless to stop you from slipping away so fast.</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, God, are you listening now?. As this cancer dances through her, and then takes a bow. It won't disappoint the crowd, whose word is a curse, as I hear them one-by-one. Please pull the string, and I come undone.</segment2>
		<segment3>I know this. I felt the same. I'm sleeping by your side. You're worth this. I wouldn't trade a day. So many days I've been blind. I want to stop and rewind. Kick off our shoes and dance with the ghost of you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Who could tease me and leave me begging for the abuse?. You're the only I knew that could tame me, and make me who I am. But now, there's self-blaming and there's nothing left of all my plans.</segment4>
		<segment5>I know this. I felt the same. I'm sleeping by your side. You're worth this. I wouldn't trade a day. So many days I've been blind. I want to stop and rewind. Kick off our shoes and dance.</segment5>
		<segment6>Let's dance again. We'll turn up our sleeves. I know just where to begin. Dance, let's dance again. We could find ourselves before this happens..</segment6>
		<segment7>Words of mine are trite and simple shame. Still we find a place in everything. It's just to break the silence that has been crushing me. Half of me is dead, already gone. Half is screaming everyone is wrong. Finally asking now, will you just hear me out?</segment7>
		<segment8>This was all my fault. You brought me death, and it's everything I wanted. It's the wrong side of fear that kept me out.	    </segment8>
