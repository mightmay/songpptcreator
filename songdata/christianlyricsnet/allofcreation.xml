		<segment1>Separated until the veil was torn. The moment that hope was born. and guilt was pardoned once and for all</segment1>
		<segment2>Captivated but no longer bound by chains. left at an empty grave. the sinner and the sacred resolved</segment2>
		<segment3>[chorus:]. and all of creation sing with me now. lift up your voice and lay your burden down. and all of creation sing with me now. fill up the heavens let his glory resound</segment3>
		<segment4>Time has faded and we see him face to face. every doubt erased forever we will worship the king</segment4>
		<segment5>[repeat chorus]</segment5>
		<segment6>ohh ah ohhh..ohh ah ohhh</segment6>
		<segment7>the reason we breathe is to sing of his glory. and for all he has done praise the father praise the son and the spirit in one</segment7>
		<segment8>[repeat chorus 2x]</segment8>
		<segment9>and every knee will bow oh and every tongue praise the father praise the son and the spirit in one    </segment9>
