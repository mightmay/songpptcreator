		<segment1>Surrounded by seclusion, solitude it stands alone. Its strength is overwhelming, And its roots have fully grown. Beneath the surface a tunnel and its begging me to dig. To find a point of resolution or a hallway to escape. Hallway to escape</segment1>
		<segment2>My breath is taken by the thought of letting go. My heart is racing as the pace begins to grow. I have a vision of a sparrow in a tree. Its begging me to dig</segment2>
		<segment3>The earth is hard and there are stones beneath my feet. I dig for hours as my hands begin to bleed. My only partner is a light that starts to fade. Stay until I'm saved. I'm saved</segment3>
		<segment4>I break the surface and see the sun. I find a path ahead, I begin to run. My legs are breaking, my lungs donÂ’t breathe. My voice sings with a melody I do not need</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't live among the broken in a village of this world. Why did you build this tunnel, why did you have to run?. You run, you run, you run</segment5>
		<segment6>The earth is hard and there are stones beneath my feet. I dig for hours as my hands begin to bleed. My only partner is a light that starts to fade. Stay until I'm saved. I'm saved    </segment6>
