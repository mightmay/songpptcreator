		<segment1>Heaven came down and glory filled my soul. When at the cross my Savior made me whole. My sins were washed away. And my night turned to day. When heaven came down and glory filled my soul</segment1>
		<segment2>O, what a wonderful, wonderful day. Day I will never forget. When I was wandering in darkness away. Jesus my Savior I met</segment2>
		<segment3>O, what a tender compassionate Friend. He met the need of my heart. Shadows dispelling with joy I am telling. He made all the darkness depart</segment3>
		<segment4>O, what a wonderful, wonderful day, yeah, today. And O, what a glorious, glorious day. The day You came, came to save me. O, what a wonderful, wonderful day. The day You came and You saved me    </segment4>
