		<segment1>Please don't be so naive!. You know you're not fooling anyone!. You're not as tough as you think. The dirty second hands, the dirty second hands. Can't get nothing for free. It becomes so predictable. You start fighting to breathe. The dirty second hands, the dirty second hands. Here's the face of everything that breaks you down: But now you face the face of everything that breaks you down!. With an army of &quot;me&quot;, we invent our own enemies. It's man versus machine and the dirty second hands, the dirty second hands. In the land of the free and the home of the remedy, the old clock is a thief with dirty second hands, with dirty second hands. Here's the face of everything that breaks you down: Now you face the face of everything that breaks you down!. Are you really as tough as you think?. You blink and you're over the brink, you bleed but the blood runs pink with dirty second hands, dirty second hands. You're not quite as tough as you thought. You bought the American wrath, the very scene that you thought you'd. shot with dirty second hands, dirty second hands. You might be right. The fight might be right inside you. The blind leading the light to you so not. leaving you blind you with dirty second hands. Here's the face of everything that breaks you down. (you, blind you with dirty second hands): But now you face the face of everything that breaks you down. (you, blind you with dirty second hands)!. You're the face, the face of everything that breaks you down..    </segment1>
