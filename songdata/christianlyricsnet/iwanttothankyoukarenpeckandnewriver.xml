		<segment1>To the guy who left the pamphlet on the midnight Greyhound bus, that asked me if i new where i was going, to the late night TV preacher when i couldn't sleep a wink, reminding me there's peace for those who know Him, to the kid who wore the T-shirt that said, &quot;Elvis is cool, but Jesus is the one and only King&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I want to thank you for the witness you have been. I want to thank you for reminding me of Him. For the way your'e unashamed to show your faith. In a world that needs His mercy and His grace. I want to thank you</segment2>
		<segment3>To the local gospel DJ who works every single night, Playing songs to reach the nonbelievers, To the little white-haired lady who works at the SACK'N'Save. Who always says &quot;God Bless You&quot; when you see her, To a mom and dad who spent a lifetime on their knees, Praying for a child they loved so dear, I wish i told them more while they were here,</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: I want to thank you for the witness you have been. I want to thank you for reminding me of Him. For the way your'e unashamed to show your faith. In a world that needs His mercy and His grace. I want to thank you</segment4>
		<segment5>Some of them were family and some of them were friends, Some of them were strangers, But all were heaven- sent. I want to thank you. I want to thank you. For the way you're unashamed to show your faith. In a world that needs His mercy and His grace. I want to thank you. I want to thank you    </segment5>
