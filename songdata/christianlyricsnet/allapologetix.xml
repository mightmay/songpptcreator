		<segment1>Weird Al should agree;. It's all a parody. Someone else could've made every song we played. What if you don't like lines the band rewrites?. What else do you need. .. Our apologies?. But if our songs get someone to see the Son, Is it wrong? Is it wrong?. Really? Really?. Writing music that's new is easier to do. But that's not the goal;. Let me save some souls. I change all the names. I can see no shame. Then someone to me will turn (and say). Don't you guys do anything original?. But if our songs get the world to sing along, Is it wrong? Is it wrong?. Dare we?. Yeah, we really feel we can. I know it's all right, I know it's all right. I know it's all right, I know it's all right. I know it's all right, I know it's all right. I know it's all right, I know it's all right.     </segment1>
