		<segment1>One, two, three stop break. Count to three and if I don't see You. You're fake. I heard You care. Now don't dare. Show Yourself I'll believe. Show Yourself I'll still proceed. Show Yourself I'll believe. No I won't</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't want to see You. My eyes see what's true. I don't want to feel You. But still I do</segment2>
		<segment3>You say You are mine. I just want to leave this behind. I think You're nothing but an act. A good one. Don't You try. Whatever You do I'll deny. Why is it so convincing?</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't lie why can't I just drop this. Get this out of my head    </segment4>
