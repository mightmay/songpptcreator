		<segment1>Today has grown wings and we're welcoming change. With expectation, open eyes, and outstretched arms. We're asking &quot;sweet spirit place your mark on us. Sweet spirit, let our mortality be swallowed by life.&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>We're shedding this thick, Numb and overly insensitive skin. And trading it for something we can live with. To live and breathe without restriction. </segment2>
		<segment3>Now this is your release. We've burned out the eyes of restraint. DonÂ’t hold back. This is the release. We're changed from within. Jesus You've proved where the real freedom's from    </segment3>
