		<segment1>Our God is mercy. Our God is mercy. If your heart is heavy. If your soul is thirsty. There is a refuge. A home for the lonely. Our God is near. Our God is near. Our God is near. Our God is near</segment1>
		<segment2>The kingdom of our God is near. Lift your eyes, lift your eyes. The hope of heaven's drawing near. Lift your eyes, lift your eyes. You're blessed if you've been torn apart. You're blessed if you've a broken heart. 'Cause hope is waiting at the door. Salvation's near</segment2>
		<segment3>Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes. Lift up your eyes and sing. Lift up your eyes, lift up your eyes. Lift up your eyes and sing    </segment3>
