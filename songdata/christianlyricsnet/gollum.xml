		<segment1>I love it, I hate it. For the fire it stirs in me. My passion, soul ashen. Do I want to be set free? </segment1>
		<segment2>When time marches on relentless. I reach for you. When pressing on seems senseless. I reach (for you)</segment2>
		<segment3>Kill my idols. Only you can satisfy. Kill my idols. You won't let me calcify</segment3>
		<segment4>I love it, I hate it. Like I love and hate myself. You are my golden eye. Teach me to delight in you</segment4>
		<segment5>And you can take. You can take it all away. My fist is open. You can take it all away    </segment5>
