		<segment1>Before you decided to come uninvited. Then I saw you in her eyes, just before she walked away. Now that you've arrived, there's nothing I can say</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. Except Hello to you Heartache. Welcome to this heartbreak. I swore I'd never see you again, I'm inviting you. To my funeral party, where loneliness is always. Singing loud above the crowd, songs of love gone wrong. So Hello to you Heartache, Hello to you..</segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse 2:]. Such an awkward guest, but you can stay awhile I guess. And I'll make the best of this. And its been so hard to sleep with you lying next to me. In the place she used to be.</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus 2:]. So Hello to you Heartache. Welcome to this heartbreak. I swore I'd never see you again, I'm inviting you. To my funeral party, where loneliness is always. Singing loud above the crowd, songs of love gone wrong. So Hello to you Heartache, Hello to you..</segment4>
		<segment5>[Bridge:]. There's no conversation, just anticipation. for the games about to begin. Its my celebration, and its hell that I'm payin. Its like the party never Ends..</segment5>
		<segment6>Heard you callin and I'm all alone. Have you decided to come uninvited?    </segment6>
