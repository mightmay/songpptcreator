		<segment1>Keep the rhythm pumping through your soul, you've got to keep it cool and let the people know. Kick it harder and harder, each time you bring the noise, it gets louder. Speak your mind, and tell me how you feel, you've got to keep it cool, come on and keep it real. False lies and false accusations. leave no room for intelligent conversation. Getting higher, then you fall down to the ground, don't you want more out of life than to be tied down. You keep begging me to come back to you like I did before, but I'm not going to do that anymore. Once upon a time, a long time ago, a man came to earth to. let the people know he kicked it harder and harder, each time he brought the noise, it got louder    </segment1>
