		<segment1>Another sleepy Sunday, safe within the walls. Outside a dying world in desperation calls. But no one hears the cries or knows what they're about. The doors are locked within, or is it from without?</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Looking through rose colored stained glass windows. Never allowing the world to come in. Seeing no evil and feeling no pain</segment2>
		<segment3>Making the light as it comes from within so dim.. so dim. Out on your doorstep lay the masses in decay. Ignore them long enough, maybe they'll go away. When you think you have so much, you have so much to lose. You think you have no lack, when you're really destitute    </segment3>
