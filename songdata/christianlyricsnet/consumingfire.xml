		<segment1>Set this place on fire. Send you spirit, Savior. Rescue from the mire. Show Your servant favor. Yesterday was the day that I was alone. Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God. Chorus: and yes our God, He is a consuming fire. And the flames burn down deep in my soul. Yes our God He is a consuming fire. He reaches inside and He melts down this. cold heart of stone. Set this place on fire. Send Your spirit, Saviour. Rescue form the mire. Show your servant favor. Yesterday was the day that I was alone. Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God. Repeat chorus. Did you realize that inside you there is a flame?. Did you ever try to let it burn?    </segment1>
