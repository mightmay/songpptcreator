		<segment1>WE SING A SONG OVER NATIONS, OUR VOICES ROAR IN PRAISE. THE LORD ON HIGH HE IS MIGHTY, HIS PROMISE NEVER FAILS. ONLY SON, RISEN ONE. ONLY SON, YOUR KINGDOM COME. GLORIOUS, GLORIOUS, GLORIOUS IS OUR GOD. GLORIOUS, ALIVE IN US, GLORIOUS IS OUR GOD. WE SING A SONG OVER PEOPLE, FROM EVERY PLACE ON EARTH. WE SPEAK SALVATION TO MILLIONS, THE PROMISE OF NEW BIRTH. HEÂ’S CALLING THE NATIONS FORTH, CREATION WILL HEAR HIS VOICE.    </segment1>
