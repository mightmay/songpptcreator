		<segment1>Hey, its me. Im sorry its so late. I cant sleep. I knew Youd be awake (Psalm 121:4). Youre always home. Waiting by the phone. For nights like these. When Im feeling all alone</segment1>
		<segment2>I wish it didnt always. Have to be this way. I wish that I could talk to You. Face to face. But nothing compares to the way. You always listen and know just what to say. Hold my hand. I cant stand alone. Here I am. Waiting for You to take me home</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, I just want to sing. I only wish there was a word. For what You mean to me. I would only say it once. In hushed tones. So it would not grow old. But all I have. Is I love You</segment3>
		<segment4>Youre my Jesus, Youre my hero. Everything I wish that I could be. Youre the one who comforts me. When everyone is gone away. I cant stand alone. Here I am. Waiting for You to take me home. And I will keep on singing. Because You hear me. And I will keep on smiling. Because Youre near me. Ill sleep well on a promise tonight     </segment4>
