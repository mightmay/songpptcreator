		<segment1>i can't comprehend your love for me. i can't understand why you died for me. died for me. why you died for me. i still don't understand. my question begs sincerity. if i could please know why. why you died for me. died for me. why you died for me. so i reach out to find myself a savior. because i need you more than ever. so please don't let me go. your love is never ending like the sky. so vast and wide. so i reach out to the background. you pick me up and say keep moving. you'll be there to catch me when i fall. and i fall so hard    </segment1>
