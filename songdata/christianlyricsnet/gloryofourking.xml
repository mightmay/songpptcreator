		<segment1>The rock are going to cry out if we don't. Now's the time to raise a song. Hear creation shout loud. We will join our voices to the sound</segment1>
		<segment2>Stand up, stand up the time has come. Sing it out, sing an anthem to His name. A generation worshiping unashamed. Giving all for the glory of our King. We will run, we will run after Your heart. We believe You all that You say You are. Giving all for the glory of our King. The glory of our King</segment2>
		<segment3>The church is waking up now. To be Your Hands and feet upon this earth. Send us in Your power. As we take Heaven to a broken world</segment3>
		<segment4>We are, we are a chosen. We are, we are called to follow. We are, we are Your generation. You are, You are the God who saves us. You are, You are the God who sends us. You are, You are the God who's with us    </segment4>
