		<segment1>Been told once, been told twice. He just won't listen to advice. It's in God's book but he don't wanna look. His friends say it's so uncool. You're better off without those rules. Your life's your own, you live it alone. He can't ignore his misunderstanding leaves him sore. He can't explain why his life is full of so much pain. He parents pushed it on him. He wasn't ever really interested. Now he's old enough to make up his own mind. He was only going thru the motion. Now he's drawing in the ocean.
