		<segment1>If you are the mountain, i am the climber, If you are the ocean, i am the diver, For you are i am. If you are the potter, i am the clay, If you are the sunlight, i am the day, For you are i am. You are the vine, i am the branch. I am the dancer, you are the dance.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. You are i am, and there is no other. You are my passion, my vision, my color. You are i am, my everything. You are i am, you are i am.</segment2>
		<segment3>If you are the song, lord, i will sing, If you are the player, i am the strings, For you are i am. If i am the novel, you are the writer. If i am the gold, lord, you are the fire. For you are i am. You are the wind, i am the eagle. I am the canvas, you are the painter    </segment3>
