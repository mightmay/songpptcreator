		<segment1>I don't know what's happening. Everything around me has come crashing to the ground. It's here I see my need. In all the devastation. I'm praying for a miracle, help me to escape. Again</segment1>
		<segment2>My life is a mass destruction. You're pulling me from the mess I'm in. You take me away. There's glass in the air I'm breathing. Somehow my heart keeps beating till. You take me away</segment2>
		<segment3>Will you send an angel. A ray of sunlight shining through the darkness of my world. That's falling down on me. You are my salvation. The only one to rescue me from the torment that I'm in. Again</segment3>
		<segment4>My life is a mass destruction. You're pulling me from the mess I'm in. You take me away. There's glass in the air I'm breathing. Somehow my heart keeps beating till. You take me away</segment4>
		<segment5>Goodbye my hurting. Goodbye my needing. Goodbye my worries. Goodbye to all of my bleeding</segment5>
		<segment6>My life is a mass destruction. You're pulling me from the mess I'm in. You take me away. There's glass in the air I'm breathing. Somehow my heart keeps beating till. You take me away</segment6>
