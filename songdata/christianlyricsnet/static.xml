		<segment1>. When the glitter fades, It fades so fast. What really lasts, what will the anthem be?. Did we sing of rock and roll?. Did we sing if sacred souls?. Has the heart and the harmony met pleasingly?</segment1>
		<segment2>When the flicker fades, it fades so fast. Nothing is left. What will be legacies?. Cause guitars burn you see. Recollect no memories. Of the lights and the cheers and the human vanity</segment2>
		<segment3>Should I give?. Should I sing some rust?. Pity me for my golden lust. This ones for the lily. And this ones for the rose</segment3>
		<segment4>Here it is, let the truth be told. Here it is, we would like to know. Here it is, what will the anthem be</segment4>
		<segment5>What will your anthem be?. What will our anthem be?. What will the anthem be? </segment5>
		<segment6>    </segment6>
