		<segment1>I realize I missed a day. But I'm too wrecked to care anyway. I look around and see this face. What the hell have I lost my taste</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't want to find out. Just want to cut out</segment2>
		<segment3>My head explodes, my ears ring. I can't remember just where I've been. The last thing that I recall. I got lost in a deep black hole</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't want to find out. Just want to cut out</segment4>
		<segment5>Blackout. I really had a Blackout</segment5>
		<segment6>I grab my things and make a run. On my way out, another one. Would like to know before I stop. Did I make it or did I flop</segment6>
		<segment7>Don't want to find out. Just want to get out</segment7>
		<segment8>Blackout. I really had a Blackout</segment8>
		<segment9>Don't want to find out. Just want to get out</segment9>
		<segment10>Blackout. I really had a Blackout    </segment10>
