		<segment1>This space I passed is in my eyes. The words you spoke will blow away like leaves in time. The clarity is hard to need. And I am left with words I'm leaving underneath</segment1>
		<segment2>This is oceans in races, start again. Cuz you want everything. This is oceans in races, start again. Cuz you want everything</segment2>
		<segment3>I see beneath, I hear the breath. I feel the deep, shallow dreams I try to pass. But in this place, what I can say, It's just a place where I will start to find a stay</segment3>
		<segment4>This is oceans in races, start again. Cuz you want everything. This is oceans in races, start again. Cuz you want everything. Everything</segment4>
		<segment5>Your world is crashing to the ground, Your love. Your world is crashing to the ground, Your love</segment5>
		<segment6>This is oceans in races, start again. Cuz you want everything. This is oceans in races, start again. Cuz you want everything</segment6>
		<segment7>(This space I passed) This is oceans in (is in my eyes) races, start again. (It's hard to need) Cuz you want everything. (I see beneath) This is oceans in (I hear the breath) races, start again. (It's hard to need) Cuz you want everything </segment7>
		<segment8>*&lt;em&gt;These lyrics may be incorrect and will be updated when the album is released&lt;/em&gt;*    </segment8>
