		<segment1>The bird that plucked the Olive Leaf. has been circling like a record never-ending in my mind. where the needle's worn the grooves too deep, and scratched the wax that's blistered from the heat besides. so from any movement in the room-. if my cat walked by the arm skipped!. but to my surprise, my interrupting cat improved. a sound already so severely compromised </segment1>
		<segment2>the needle's worn the grooves too deep </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm a donkey's jaw on a desert dune. beside the bush that Moses saw. that burned and yet was not consumed. she's the silver coin I lost, I'm the sheep who slipped away. we pray the fingers crossed. but you listen patiently anyway </segment3>
		<segment4>I wrote a little song for you. with a melody I'd borrowed put to words that didn't rhyme. to repeat what you already knew. as the stones thrown at your window tapped a syncopated time. you kept a distance out of fear you'd break. but what good's a single windchime, hanging quiet all alone?. the music our collisions would make. is a sound that turns the road-that-leads-us-back-home. into Home. </segment4>
		<segment5>the music our collisions make! </segment5>
		<segment6>I had a rusty spade but I'm not the fighting sort. if I was Samson I'd have found that harlot's blade. and cut my own hair short!. then in a market dimly lit I come casually to pay. you see my coins are counterfeit. but accept them anyway </segment6>
		<segment7>so spare me your goodbyes, your waving-handkerchief-good-byes. given my tendency to err so on the sentimental side. I'll spare you my goodbyes, the truth belongs to G-d, the mistakes were mine</segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
