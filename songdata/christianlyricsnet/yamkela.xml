		<segment1>Wasted, disposable dying scum. Two months tops before silence replace your small beating drum. Isn't that what we're all waiting for. So we can go home and celebrate our good life</segment1>
		<segment2>But I feel gun powder. Burning under my skin. Don't say another word. You might set off a spark. Cause I've got gun powder. Burning under my skin</segment2>
		<segment3>Take me back to TV-land. Numbness is a safe zone. They never trained me for reality. I'm a reality-TV clone. Now did you say your 10 going on 11. Something is terribly wrong. Somehow I'm dying with you</segment3>
		<segment4>But I feel gun powder. Burning under my skin. Don't say another word. You might set off a spark. Cause I've got gun powder. Burning under my skin</segment4>
		<segment5>Yemkela. Don't leave now    </segment5>
