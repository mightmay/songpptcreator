		<segment1>I'm convinced I've seen, an escape for everything, They might have different names, but they're all the same, But the secret's safe inside, alone and dark it hides, And I'd ignore it, but it won't go away</segment1>
		<segment2>And all I feel is static, this beat is automatic, I've tried to kick this habit, but every time I grab it</segment2>
		<segment3>I, won't be the safest place to hide, Take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies. And I won't be your safest place to hide, Lord, help me break these chains, I need to see the light</segment3>
		<segment4>And now I see the way, You've constructed me, Taking all that was, and throwing it away, Now I know it's just, the flame in all of us, And I can burn this up, or blow it away</segment4>
		<segment5>And all I feel is static, this beat is automatic, I've tried to kick this habit, but every time I grab it</segment5>
		<segment6>I, won't be the safest place to hide, Take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies. And I won't be your safest place to hide, Lord, help me break these chains, I need to see the light</segment6>
		<segment7>And all I feel is friction, I don't want it, I hate this addiction(repeated)</segment7>
		<segment8>I, won't be the safest place to hide, Take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies. And I won't be your safest place to hide, Lord, help me break these chains, I need to see the light. I, won't be the safest place to hide, Take this cup from me, your sick and twisted lies. And I won't be your safest place to hide, Lord, help me break these chains, I need to see the light.     </segment8>
