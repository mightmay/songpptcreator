		<segment1>Two steps beyond the edge. I cant undo this leap of faith. Takes my breath away. So high above the ground. Youve got me hanging in mid air. Between here and there. Now all I have is You</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Im not afraid. I know Im safe. Its a chance but my choice is made. Im not alone. You wont let go. And I know through it all. You hold me in the freefall</segment2>
		<segment3>If I just believe my eyes. Id see I should be terrified. But Im so alive. I dont know how or when. But I believe that Youll come through. Lord, Im trusting You. Cant wait to see what You will do</segment3>
		<segment4>Im falling, Im falling, Im falling</segment4>
		<segment5>You got me falling from the sky with no parachute. Thinking I can fly but I know its You. Got me up here, no fear, no tears. Minds clear cause I know Youre here. Cant wait to see what You will do    </segment5>
