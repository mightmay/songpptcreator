		<segment1>Who keeps the balance in suspended skies. Supporting Earth with inward thrust. Let the audience refocus eyes. On all sky flashings in front of us. Who's seen in the midst of unsealing skies. It's revelation that all can see. And yet our hearts remain hushed inside. Mindless of fantasia we enjoy for free</segment1>
		<segment2>It takes a miracle, kaleidoscope superior. Spinning vortex, bleeding shades of night to day</segment2>
		<segment3>Sovereign pictures center stage. Genius of the cosmic craze. Days and nights keep on and on. God abroad in blended song</segment3>
		<segment4>In our sky flashings</segment4>
		<segment5>Who can deny this pure design. Emanating views never seen. Revealing art to mortal minds. Entranced in our phantasmic dreams.     </segment5>
