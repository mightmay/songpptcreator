		<segment1>Im swept away in this moment. I feel your heartbeat next to mine. My hands are trembling. Its overwhelming</segment1>
		<segment2>A whisper breaks through the silence. A vow to test the breadth of time. Until forever, Ill be forever yours</segment2>
		<segment3>Not just tonight. Im by your side. For all your life</segment3>
		<segment4>Til death comes between us. And the heavens steal you away. Ill stay yours forever. Dont you worry, dont be afraid</segment4>
		<segment5>The heart can shift like a shadow. The deepest passions start to wane. Stay ever tender. Never surrender</segment5>
		<segment6>Come waltz with me through the twilight. And we will dance as seasons pass. We move together. Ill be forever yours</segment6>
		<segment7>So hold me tight. Say youll be mine. For all your life</segment7>
		<segment8>Come what may</segment8>
		<segment9>So all we have is this moment. But moments come and go so fast. Until forever. Ill be forever yours</segment9>
		<segment10>There is no other. I am forever yours    </segment10>
