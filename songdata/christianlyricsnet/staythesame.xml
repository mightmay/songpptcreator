		<segment1>Staring at the stars late last night, You placed them in the sky yet I'm all that's on Your mind. Looking at the sand between my toes, it's crazy that each one of those is a thought of peace. Are You talking to me, because if You are let me catch my breath. You will be the one I love, because You will never change even if I stay the same. You will be the one I love, how could I refuse hands nailed open to prove?. Everywhere You are is where I'll be, I live to love my King that's where I am free. Are You talking to me, because if You are let me catch my breath. You will be the one I love, because You will never change even if I stay the same. You will be the one I love, how could I refuse hands nailed open to prove?. I'm not the same, I'm not the same.     </segment1>
