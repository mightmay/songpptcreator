		<segment1>Take this heart of mine. You've captured me. I'm so in love with You</segment1>
		<segment2>My destiny defined is spending every moment just to know You. I need to know You more</segment2>
		<segment3>You're my world, You're my heart's desire. Faithful love takes me higher. I found more than I ever dared imagine</segment3>
		<segment4>Love has found a way, love has found a way. I've opened my heart to You. You've taken what was broken, made me new. And all that I need to find are ways to let You know. How much I love You</segment4>
		<segment5>I want to love You more. Angels are gathering to bow and sing an anthem to Your Name. Lifted on Heaven's wings</segment5>
		<segment6>This song in my heart needs to say. Oh, how I love You Lord</segment6>
		<segment7>YouÂ´re my world, You're my heart's desire. Faithful love takes me higher. I found more than I ever dreamed or imagined. Love has found a way, love has found a way    </segment7>
