		<segment1>Patiently I wait. And all I can say. I need so much more of you. VERSE 1. In your light I'll stay. And I want you to drop me into your arms full of love. Take me where I can't go alone</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Give this soul what it needs. I want life from you in me. Jesus your love lifts me up. You're all that I've been searching for. Everything I have is yours. Jesus your love lifts me up</segment2>
		<segment3>VERSE2. I wait here for you to speak. Words that give new life to me. I know I could never have to much. when I am in a desperate place. You give light to my escape. and carry me when I am weak. Oh Lord it's you I seek</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE. Hold me close. When I fall down. I'm crying out. With out a sound</segment5>
		<segment6>Hold me close. When I fall down. I'm crying out. Save me now</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS    </segment7>
