		<segment1>Why do I get so upset?. Letting feelings dictate what is right. Letting emotions take control, letting emotions consume my thoughts and my actions. Give me a blessing, some kind of miracle. and I'll give you my life. No, it shouldn't work out this way, selfish humility makes this dividing wall. Your selfishness drives you away, your so confused, take forgiveness, and let him transform your mind, you offered me eternity, in return I sacrifice my will for your glory.    </segment1>
