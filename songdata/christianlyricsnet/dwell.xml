		<segment1>Head hurts. back here again, I. painted the walls, the cracks remain, and. I fear, to close my eyes, become accustomed, so dig in. Every time, I breathe this air, the sick stench, never seems to go away.</segment1>
		<segment2>You fail, You break, You freak, You falter, You lie, You kill, You burn, Youre nothing..(x 2). to me..</segment2>
		<segment3>Head hurts. back here again, I. painted the walls, the cracks remain, and. every time, I breathe this air, the sick stench, it never seems to go away, ..go away. . .</segment3>
		<segment4>You fail, You break, You freak, You falter, You lie, You kill, You burn, Youre nothing..(x 2)</segment4>
		<segment5>I feel it changing, the air..clean.. its you..</segment5>
		<segment6>You fail, You break, You freak, You falter, You lie, You kill, You burn, Youre nothing..(x 2)    </segment6>
