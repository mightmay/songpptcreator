		<segment1>Wonderful, so wonderful. Is Your unfailing love. Your cross has spoken mercy over me. No eye has seen, no ear has heard. No heart could fully know. How glorious, how beautiful you are!</segment1>
		<segment2>Beautiful One I love. Beautiful One I adore. Beautiful One my soul must sing</segment2>
		<segment3>Powerful, so powerful. Your glory fills the skies. Your mighty works displayed for all to see. The beauty of Your majesty. Awakes my heart to sing. How marvellous, how wonderful You are</segment3>
		<segment4>You opened my eyes to Your wonders anew. You captured my heart with this love. Because nothing on earth is as beautiful as You </segment4>
		<segment5>My soul, my soul must sing. My soul, my soul must sing. My soul, my soul must sing. Beautiful One    </segment5>
