		<segment1>Float by open windows. What a shipwreck, what a shipwreck. Circles running through my veins. With the vates set, with the vates set</segment1>
		<segment2>See the lines, see the lines. I start feeling. When I'm lost, when I'm lost. There's no meaning. Call it this, call it this. Spinning sideways and never stops</segment2>
		<segment3>Lines in the sky calling me out, calling me out. Constant collide, calling me out, calling me out</segment3>
		<segment4>Float by open windows. What a  shipwreck, what a shipwreck. Glass flies all around me. Now my veins let, now my veins let</segment4>
		<segment5>Call to the trees. There are ways no one sees. I never hear it the same way twice. Because it's in the way they move, you see. The trees, they want us to hear them    </segment5>
