		<segment1>We took the twine we used to use. to tie up tight our tattered shoes. twisted twigs and crooked cross. a necklace for the deeply lost. Builder with the broken bricks. Mother to the baby chicks. You made this world to look so nice. I wonder what the next one's like?. yellow spider, yellow leaf. confirms my deepest held belief.     </segment1>
