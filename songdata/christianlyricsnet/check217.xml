		<segment1>You better check yourself (Check yourself). Before you check on me (Check on me). Check the 217 (Rejoice). Come on the family (Unity). Ask me where I stand and what's my reason. Ask me what's my rhyme and who I'm pleasin'. Ask me why I love and why I'm breathin. Ask me what's the time and the season. The times are changin but my status stays the same. We all got the purpose and the purpose ain't fame. The Almighty Christ is my redemptive claim. People are created now one in the same. Universe come together. Servants come together. Culture come together. Family come together. You better check yourself (Check yourself). Before you check on me (Check on me). Check the 217 (Rejoice). Come on the family (Unity). Tell me where I stand and what's my reason. Tell me what's my rhyme and who I'm pleasin'. Tell me why I love and why I'm breathin'. Tell me what's the time and the season. I'd like to inform that humans are the norm. We all like to swarm but the curtain was torn. Outpouring or redemption. That sinks to the core open the door. Come one Come rock the voices resound. Come one come rock. Check yourslef.     </segment1>
