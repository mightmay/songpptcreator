		<segment1>Here I go against the grain. It's time to yet again complain. And make some noise. Make some noise. We've got all our sciences. Making our appliances. To dull the pain. It's Novacaine for the soul</segment1>
		<segment2>Hollywood, pop culture's best. You do no good, you vultures' nest. And I want out. I want out. It's gambling now, the more you wait. And think that you can have your Kate. And Edith, too. And so to lose your own soul</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll call your bluff, I've had enough. Oh-no, Ho-Jo</segment3>
		<segment4>So is it fantasy or is it reality t.v.?. So here's your world condoned. You get the chisel. I'l get the stone</segment4>
		<segment5>Know that with each path we take. We become the choices that we make. It's true, and so do you. Forbear to keep obstinate will. And to choose to wait until. The dream dissolves. And we're absolved from our guilt</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll call your bluff, I've had enough. Oh-no, Ho-Jo</segment6>
		<segment7>So is it fantasy or is it reality t.v.?. So here's your world condoned. You get the chisel. I'l get the stone. So numbed, to fate resigned. And in your grave you'll lie </segment7>
