		<segment1>Through this silent night I've been watching the sky. I've been following the brightest star with my eyes.. Saviour is born.. Rejoice!</segment1>
		<segment2>I thought this was another night ruled by penetrating darkness, but the star I saw was a sign of something else. The star had stopped above this place. Following it here I found Him.</segment2>
		<segment3>Holy night of the Saviour's birth, little child in manger. We respect the spirit of Christmas as we celebrate the Christ Mass..</segment3>
		<segment4>There He was; a little child, yet glowing with divinity, I was allowed to kneel before and to worship Him. With my mind and in my heart. I could feel He is the Lord.</segment4>
		<segment5>This was a night of joy but as well a night of grief. Herod gave an order to kill 'cause his fear for this King.. Saviour is born. Rejoice!</segment5>
		<segment6>&quot;For my eyes have seen Your salvation which You have prepared, in the sight of all people, a light for revelation, to the Gentiles and for Glory, to Your people Israel.&quot; -Luke 2:30-32</segment6>
		<segment7>Holy night of the Saviour's birth, little child in manger. We respect the spirit of Christmas as we celebrate the Christ Mass.. Christ Mass..    </segment7>
