		<segment1>Well it breaks my heart. Every time I see the world break yours in two. You know those lies ain't true. When you let 'em get to you. Being you is hard to be, I see</segment1>
		<segment2>These days sticks and stones. Sound like paradise. Compared to those harsh words. They'd rather cut you down then hold you. But they don't know you like I know you. If they did, I know they'd see, Yes, they would see..</segment2>
		<segment3>To me you are. Heaven's finest invention by far. So much brighter than the brightest star. And what I'd give to make you see. Who you are to me</segment3>
		<segment4>All your so called friends. Said they'd be there till the bitter end (all gone). But I won't be just like the others. I'm gonna to show you my true colors. You can't ever make me leave. No, no, I won't ever leave</segment4>
		<segment5>To me you are. Heaven's finest invention by far. Even brighter than the brightest star. And what I'd give to make you see. Who you are to me</segment5>
		<segment6>When you laugh it's my favorite song. And all the gray is gone. Every single time I see you smile. I just haven't seen it in awhile</segment6>
		<segment7>So go on and dream. Bigger dreams than this town's ever seen before. There are just two kinds of people: Ones who say you're just not able. And the ones who change the world. And you're gonna change the world</segment7>
		<segment8>To me you are. Heaven's finest invention by far. Even brighter than the brightest star. And what I'd give to make you see. Who you are to me. ..to me.     </segment8>
