		<segment1>The voice of an angel, I cannot tell. Light or darkness, heaven or hell. The smile of a believer, wedged and bound. Friend or deceiver, the truth or a lie</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes. Say everything and nothing at the same time. Still there's something to loose my mind. She sings in riddles, she sings in rhymes</segment2>
		<segment3>Words of a poet, in perfect time. With Christians and answeres, Every verse, every line</segment3>
		<segment4>But I smile and I wonder, is there a song. I'm not always silent. Is it right, is it wrong?    </segment4>
