		<segment1>You know who she is. You know what she does. Only I know what that girl's doing to you. You know who she is. You know what she does. Only I know what that girl. Is going to do to you </segment1>
		<segment2>There's one for every band. Almost one for every man. If you're not careful. She'll eat you up. So please be careful </segment2>
		<segment3>Yoko, Yoko. Nagging all the time. Wasting all his time. Yoko, Yoko. Be careful with that boy. Better be careful with that boy </segment3>
		<segment4>She'll win you with composure. And perfect nonchalance. She'll lure you in and snag you. Make you think you're the Fonz. She'll get you in her clutches. Make you her confidant. She'll nag you and she'll drag you. Man you've gotta get rid of that debutante </segment4>
		<segment5>She'll nag you to death. And by inches will suck all the life. That you somehow have left. Yeah it'll only be nag, nag, nag, nag     </segment5>
