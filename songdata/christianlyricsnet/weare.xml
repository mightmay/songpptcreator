		<segment1>Think I'm ready.  I think I've got it.  Cause to much thinking is bad for my health.  It's like a fire 'cause when I start it.  I can't control it and I burn myself.  But I can't just sit here and watch it.  If we don't stop it no one will</segment1>
		<segment2> We are the ones, we are the guns.  And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung.  We are the change, we are the chains that hold us.  We are the choice, we are the strong.  We are one</segment2>
		<segment3> My heart is racing, just like a rocket.  Victory looks like a distant dream.  Cause what we're fighting is not gonna stopped.  But we can beat it if we just believe.  But I can't just sit here and watch it.  If we don't stop it no one will</segment3>
		<segment4> We are the ones, we are the guns.  And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung.  We are the change, we are the chains that hold us.  We are the choice, we are the strong.  We are one</segment4>
		<segment5> We are the ones, we are the guns.  And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung.  We are the change, we are the chains that hold us.  We are the choice, we are the strong.  We are one</segment5>
		<segment6> If we don't stop it no one will</segment6>
		<segment7> We are the ones, we are the guns.  And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung.  We are the change, we are the chains that hold us.  We are the choice, we are the strong.  We are one</segment7>
		<segment8> We are the ones, we are the guns.  And we will ride, we are the voice of a song unsung.  We are the change, we are the chains that hold us.  We are the choice, we are the strong.  We are one    </segment8>
