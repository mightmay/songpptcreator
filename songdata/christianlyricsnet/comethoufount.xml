		<segment1>Come thou font of every blessing. Tune my heart to sing thy grace. Streams of mercy never ceasing. Call for songs of loudest praise. Teach me some melodious sonnet. Sung by flaming tongues above. Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it. Mount of thy redeeming love. Here I raise my Ebenezer. Hither by thy help I'm come. And I hope by thy good pleasure. Safely to arrive at home. Jesus sought me when a stranger. Wondering from the fold of God. He, to rescue me from danger. Interposed His precious blood. O to grace how how great a debtor daily I'm constrained to be!. Let thy goodness like a fetter, bind my wandering heart to thee. Prone to wander Lord I feel it, prone to leave the God I love. Here's my heart, O take and seal it, seal it for thy courts above    </segment1>
