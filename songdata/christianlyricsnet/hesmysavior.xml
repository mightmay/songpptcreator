		<segment1>He's the sunlight in my sky, he. is the moon that shines at night. He's the rainbow over me, the river running to the sea. The music and the poetry, the beauty tha tmy eyes can see. Still his love means so much more to me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: He's my savior and everything within me. Wants to tell the world it's true. He's my savior if you could open your heart. You would know him, too</segment2>
		<segment3>He's the fire in my soul, he melts my heart. And makes me whole. He's the air upon my breath. The gentle touch of holiness. Just for me he gave his life and. In that moment paid the price. For all I've ever done and that is why</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: He's my savior and everything within me. Wants to tell the world it's true. He's my savior the moment you open up your heart. You will know him, too</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: I can take you there but I can't cross the line. It's my deepest prayer that this will be your time</segment5>
		<segment6>I will vow, yeah. I will vow, yeah</segment6>
		<segment7>Just for me he gave his life and. in the moment paid the price. For all I've ever done and that is why</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus: He's my savior my best friend. He's my savior he's my savior, he saved me. He's my savior and everything within me wants to. Tell the world it's true. He's my savior the moment that you open up your heart. You will know him too    </segment8>
