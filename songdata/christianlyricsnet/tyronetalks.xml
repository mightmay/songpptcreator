		<segment1>I'd like to close out the set with this song. Because this song means the most to me. There are so many things an artist can chase. After and for me being a musician a Grammy. Or a gold record or something but ultimately. I think that that really satisfies us as human. Beings is relationship with one other with your. Loved ones, with your family and relationship with God. I think these are the only things that are eternal. And the rest of the things just fly away. So I'm about wanting to remember my music as. More than just me getting up here and playing and singing songs. I just want to encourage people to remember. What is important because there is so much in this?. World that we can chase after that is so unimportant. And so I just thank you guys for being here. This is my last song. If I can encourage you in anyway it's to. Remember what really is important and to. Love one other and God    </segment1>
