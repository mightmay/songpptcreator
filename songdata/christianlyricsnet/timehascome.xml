		<segment1>There is a season for everything. There is a reason for all things here on earth. Every second of every moment seems to have its worth</segment1>
		<segment2>Rest assured lifeÂ’s not in vain. For all things work here for His fame</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Time has come. To raise our hearts as one. And glorify the God everything. We live our lives. For the renown of Christ. Oh we are children of the sovereign King</segment3>
		<segment4>From the moment of our first breath. To the second we bid this world goodbye. And everything that is in between was made to magnify</segment4>
		<segment5>The One who holds all things in place. The Ruler over time and space</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus.     </segment6>
