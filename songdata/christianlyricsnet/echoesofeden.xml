		<segment1>What is it about a kiss that makes me feel like thisoh oh. What is it that makes my heart beat fast when Im in your armsoh oh. What is it about your touch that amazes me so much</segment1>
		<segment2>How is it that your sweet smile can get me through the hardest mileoh oh. Whats the magic in your eyes that brings the love in me aliveoh oh. What is it about this dance the sweetness of our romance. That makes me feel this way</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: These are the echoes of Eden. Reflections of what we were created for. Hints of the passion and freedom. That waits on the other side of heavens door. These are the echoes of Eden</segment3>
		<segment4>How is it the sky turns gray anytime youre far awayoh oh. What is it that makes me sad anytime youre feeling badoh oh. What is it about this night the music and the candlelight. That makes me feel this way</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>What is it about this night the music and the candlelight. That makes me feel this way.     </segment6>
