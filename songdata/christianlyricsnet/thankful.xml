		<segment1>I felt your gentle rain. You wash over my heart again. And I find You here. I Find You here. You take me by the hand. And when I don't understand. You hold me. You hold me. (chorus). To the cross I come again. I'm so thankful, I'm thankful. You're mercy over me again. I'm so thankful, living God. I wanna thank You living God. In the light of day. You're truth defies my way. And You call me Yours. I'm forever Yours. (bridge). For eternity, You will be, You will be. Yesterday, today and forever, You remain the same. (chorus). To the cross I come again. I'm so thankful, I'm thankful. You're mercy over me again. I'm so thankful, living God. To the cross I come again. I'm so thankful, I'm thankful. You're mercy over me again. I'm so thankful, living God. I wanna thank You living God     </segment1>
