		<segment1>These are the gates to the Kingdom. These are the courts of the everlasting King. And we enter in with praise and thanksgiving. We enter in with praise and thanksgiving. With praises on our lips. Thanksgiving in our hearts. In loving worship of our Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>I am the temple of the Spirit. I am the apple of His everloving eye. And I enter in with praise and thanksgiving. I enter in with praise and thanksgiving. With praise on my lips. Thanksgiving in my heart. In loving worship of my Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>We are the temple of the Spirit. We are the apple of His everloving eye. And we enter in with praise and thanksgiving. We enter in with praise and thanksgiving. With praises on our lips. Thanksgiving in our hearts. In loving worship of our Lord.     </segment3>
