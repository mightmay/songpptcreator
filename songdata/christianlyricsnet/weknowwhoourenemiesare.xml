		<segment1>Save my skin, I need a medic. Hold me down, I'm only sewn down. Save my teeth, show me you meant it. Catch my death, I'm only sewn together. </segment1>
		<segment2>My eyelids are heavy, and the night's wearing on. Your story's familiar, and your innocence is gone. We'd burn like the morning then break like your heart. Fall in love without warning just to fall back apart. All fevered and blistered, with nothing at stake. I feel the warmth of her whisper, and the cold of my mistakes. Her soul in the balance, my heart in her hands. I made her a widow, she made me a man.     </segment2>
