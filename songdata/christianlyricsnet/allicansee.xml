		<segment1>We have walked in the shadows. Been through the storms. Fought many battles living to learn. But all I can feel is Your peace by my side</segment1>
		<segment2>Bridge. Down in the valleys with death and with fear. You have seen my heart broken but still You are near. Down in the valleys Your hand wipes my tears. You have seen my heart broken. But still I'm singing</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. All I can see is love in Your eyes. All I can feel is peace by Your side. All I can see is love in Your eyes. With that I know You're walking by my side. You're in my eyes cause all I can see. Is love in Your eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>You look as clear. As when this journey began. My eyes have been opened. To love through Your Son. I praise You for Him. For He has been my guide</segment4>
		<segment5>- Bridge -</segment5>
