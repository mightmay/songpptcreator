		<segment1>You wanna strangle me, then here's my neck. You ain't got the strength to flex so fess. You wanna get all up in my destiny. Haughty words and rules that hinder me. Go and teach men's commandments from afar, it's who you are and you dare. Build a dam on the spiritual real; you're ruling is appealed. I've been sent to your boat to rock it. Men flood hell while your hands are in your pockets. You separate from the life source and endorse. And force secret religious codes like morse. Constraints, why do you seize us?. Just give me Jesus. I'll be free in this unruly world. Nowhere to hide, I'm going untied. Suffocation.. where's it come from; exhalation. Throw religion. I go up against the grain. You're like boa constriction, don't lube the friction. Spiritual got impeached like Nixon. Anorexic generation x result by default the inner man assault. Beat to a pulp confined from the river and no limbs for the body. Prodigals are being forced to eat pig's food. When the church has a feast for this starving crew. You cannot ever muzzle me from reprimanding what puzzles me. The rigid formalities of mankind that choke the hidden man. As you proclaim &quot;Let us make God in our own image&quot;. And when you're finished you've manipulated my passion. I'm come out thrashing. The sky turns red as I migraine the head. Liverty is what we need. Father set us free. Go up against the grain, I'm untied. Go up against the grain.     </segment1>
