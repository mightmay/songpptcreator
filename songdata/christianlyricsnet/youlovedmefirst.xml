		<segment1>Was it my broken heart that led me straight to You?. Was it your broken hands that I cannot refuse?. Was it my emptiness or was it Your empty tune?. That pointed me home, pointed me home to You</segment1>
		<segment2>I should've known all along. You're the one who loved me first. And if I had to save myself. This never would've worked. I wouldn't be in your arms. I woudlnt know where to start. But You gave Your life to prove to me. What I was worth. You loved me first</segment2>
		<segment3>You were pursuing me. Before the world began. Before there was anything I was in Your plan. What did You see in me?. How we understand. The depth of your grace. God, I'm amazed. God, I'm amazed</segment3>
		<segment4>I should've known all along. You're the one who loved me first. And if I had to save myself. This never would've worked. I wouldn't be in your arms. I woudlnt know where to start. But You gave Your life to prove to me. What I was worth. And You loved me first</segment4>
		<segment5>When I was wandering. When I was hiding. Jesus, You found me and You loved me first. God of full mercy, take all the glory. Jesus, You found me and You loved me first. You loved me first</segment5>
		<segment6>I should've known all along. You're the one who loved me first. And if I had to save myself. This never would've worked. I wouldn't be in your arms. I woudlnt know where to start. But You gave Your life to prove to me. What I was worth. You gave Your life to prove to me. What I was worth. And You loved me first. Oh, You loved me first. Yeah,Yeah. You loved me first    </segment6>
