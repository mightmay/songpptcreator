		<segment1>The walls between you and I. Always pushing us apart. Nothing left but scars fight after fight. The space between our calm and rage. Started growing shorter, Disappearing slowly day after day. . Chorus 2: I was sitting there waiting in my room for you. You were waiting for me too. And it makes me wonder</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus 1: The older I get. Will I get over it?. It's been way too long for the times we missed. I didn't know then it would hurt like this but I think. The older I get. Maybe I'll get over it. It's been way too long for the times we missed. I can't believe it still hurts like this</segment2>
		<segment3>The time between those cutting words. Built up our defenses. Never made no sense it just made me hurt. Do you believe that time heals all wounds?. It started getting better. But it's easy not to fight when I'm not with you</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus 2:</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus 1:</segment5>
		<segment6>What was I waiting for. I should've taken less and given you more. I should've weathered the storm. I need to say so bad. What were you waiting for. This could have been the best we've ever had</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus:</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm just getting older. I'm not getting over you I'm trying to. I wish it didn't hurt like this. It's been way too long for the times we missed. I can't believe it still hurts like this    </segment8>
