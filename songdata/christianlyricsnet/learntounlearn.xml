		<segment1>I'm worn out again. Feel the weight of the world crashing down on me. Teach me how to let it go. My walk has turn to a crawl. I'm on my hands and knees. How do I get up?. When did it get so hard to make it through a day?. When I was a child everything just went away. And all I've learned is nothing stays the same. And all I've learned is nothing stays but change.    </segment1>
