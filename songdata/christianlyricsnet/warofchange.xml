		<segment1>It's a truth that in love and war,  World's collide and hearts get broken,  I want to live like I know I'm dying,  Take up my cross, not be afraid</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus].  Is it true what they say, that words are weapons?.  And if it is,then everybody best stop steppin',  Cause I got ten in my pocket that'll bend ya locket,  I'm tired of all these rockers sayin' come with me,  Wait, it's just about to break, its more than I can take,  Everything's about to change,  I feel it in my veins, its not going away,  Everything's about to change.</segment2>
		<segment3> It creeps in like a thief in the night,  Without a sign, without a warning,  But we are ready and prepared to fight,  Raise up your swords, don't be afraid,</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5> This is a warning, like it or not,  I break down, like a record spinning,  Gotta get up,  So back off,  This is a warning, like it or not,  I'm tired of listenin', I'm warning you, don't try to get up,</segment5>
		<segment6> There's a war going on inside of me tonight (don't be afraid) [x2]</segment6>
		<segment7> Wait, it's just about to break, its more than I can take,  Everything's about to change,  I feel it in my veins, its not going away,  Everything's about to change,  It's just about to break, its more than I can take,  Everything's about to change,  I feel it in my veins, its not going away,  Everything's about to change.    </segment7>
