		<segment1>The congregation parted like the Red Sea. When that old drunk stumbled in down the aisle. And took a seat. Right in the middle of Amazing Grace. He could feel the judgment they were passing. Thought to himself Aint that just how some folks acting. Hed rather be on the street than in this place. And with tears on his face</segment1>
		<segment2>Youd think somebody would put their arm around him. Youd think somebody would hit a knee. Pull him in, say a prayer. Thats what Im talking bout right there. Youd think somebody would practice what theyre preachin. Well, I wonder who that somebody could be. Probly somebody like me</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, hes got problems nobody wants a part of. When he got up and slipped out nobody stood up. They dont wanna make a scene. So they let him walk outta there without a prayer</segment3>
		<segment4>Youd think somebody would do something different. Youd think somebody would go against the grain. Be the one to run him down. Bring him back and turn him around. Youd think somebody would wanna make a difference. Well, well I wonder who that somebody could be. Probly somebody like me</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh can I get a witness. Oh yeah. Youd think somebody would put their arm around him. Youd think somebody would hit a knee now. Pull him in, say a prayer yeah. Youd think somebody would put their arm around him. Youd think somebody would hit a knee. Pull him in, say a prayer. Thats what Im talking bout right there. Youd think somebody would wanna make a difference. Well, I wonder who that somebody could be. Probly somebody like me    </segment5>
