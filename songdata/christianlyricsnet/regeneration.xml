		<segment1>People try to put us down (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). Just because we're heaven-bound (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). They may stew and scoff and scold (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). I know I'll die with a born-again soul (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). This is regeneration--this is regeneration, baby. Who don't you all find the Way (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). And go to Titus 3:5 and see what it says (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). I'm not talkin' 'bout artificial resuscitation (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). Just talkin' 'bout regeneration. This is regeneration-- this regeneration, baby. Why don't you all find the Way (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). What John chapter 3 verse 3 does say (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). And First Peter 1:23 says the same thing (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). It's just talkin' 'bout regeneration (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). This is regeneration-- this regeneration, baby. Re-re-re-re-re-generation. If you're tired of puttin' us down (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). And you wanna be heaven-bound (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). Here's what you do to save your soul (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). Put hope in Christ before you get old (Talkin' 'bout regeneration). This is regeneration-- this regeneration, baby. Re-re-re-re-re-generation. This is not imagination-- this is not exaggeration. This is not meditation-- this is not vegetation. Hope you got reservations-- please do not change the station</segment1>
