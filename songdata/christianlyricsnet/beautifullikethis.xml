		<segment1>the fading sun, the rising moon. are fighting for the afternoon. the day gives in, gives up its light. the stars wake up, to keep the night</segment1>
		<segment2>and as you glory fill the sky, I wonder. how could you. consider me. so much more. than all i see. cause i am not. have never been. beautiful like this</segment2>
		<segment3>my weary words, and broken lies. are set beneath, your summer skies. what's worn and wrong, what's good and right. I laid before, my eyes tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>but you make all things new. Jesus, you make all things new. I'm beautiful in you, oh, oh, oh</segment4>
		<segment5>that's how you could. consider me. so much more. than all i see. redemption mends. a brokenness. it heals our wounds. removes our sins. your purest love. was humbly spent. to bow our hearts. and draw me in. where i become. whole again. I'm beautiful like this. I'm beautiful like this</segment5>
		<segment6>what can wash away my sin. nothing but your blood oh Jesus. Thank you, Thank you Jesus    </segment6>
