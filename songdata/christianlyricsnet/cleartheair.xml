		<segment1>Hold up, hold on. I think this thing has gone too far. And now I'm stuck in the middle. And it's falling apart. I can't wait to get some sunny weather. That brings all of us back together again. I think it's getting real strange in here. You better clear the air</segment1>
		<segment2>This time it's gone too far. This time it's a whole lot different. You've nailed each other to the wall. And no one's going to win. This time, you've gone too far. And now there is a lot more distance. You should remember who you are. You better right the wrongs</segment2>
		<segment3>Your tongue is a knife there's blood on the floor. I think this proves that words can kill. And you're killing each other with them. What's it gonna take for you both to clear your heads. And put down all your pride. Before you both just end up dumb and dead to it. I think it's way past getting strange in here. You better clear the air</segment3>
		<segment4>This time it's gone too far. This time it's a whole lot different. You've nailed each other to the wall. And no one's going to win. Like this it's gone too far. This time there's a lot more distance. You should remember who you are</segment4>
		<segment5>Hold up hold on. I think it's gone a bit too far here. Hold up hold on. Now you should be moving on. Hold up hold on. You really ought to know who you are. So you better fix it all before you fall</segment5>
