		<segment1>I met a girl named Tara. And she lived in the heart of America. She liked black caddies. Listened to puff daddy. Danced until her legs were sore</segment1>
		<segment2>She worked around the corner. At a diner with a grouchy owner. And her boyfriends shady, dates another girl named Katie. loves her definately maybe</segment2>
		<segment3>dont think i can take it. wake me when its over. so far away. i wish that it was closer. i see you every day. im too scared to go over. i wonder what she'd say. i barely even know her</segment3>
		<segment4>chorus: and how much longer. will this keep getting stronger. i wonder what shes doing when im singing myself to sleep. cause hes a faker. so see ya later. i wonder when you'll realize that she means a lot more to me</segment4>
		<segment5>i saw you in the hallway when my last class was just over. it was friday, school was out tonight. everything seems to be alright. i said yo are you going to the party at the cove.  she said hes picking me up six again and i.  dont wanna disappoint my boyfriend</segment5>
		<segment6>and shes staring at his picture hanging in her locker. shes telling all the girls about all the things that he bought her. i saw what really happened all those times he went for water. when we were at the movie theatre watching harry potter. he had his hands on. every single girl he laid his eyes on. hate to break it to you, hes a pylon. and even when he kissed her. he was looking over, staring at her sister    </segment6>
