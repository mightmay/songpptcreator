		<segment1>Three nails gave me life. May I ask this simple question, where do you belong?. Where is your destiny? Where is your identity?. Im not here to demonstrate my style. I dont want to persuade. Im not here to represent my crew, cause there are so many styles.</segment1>
		<segment2>Our void, our void, our void cannot be filled. Your life, your life, your life dont throw it away.</segment2>
		<segment3>Correct me if Im wrong, dont we all want our respect?. Who doesnt want to be loved? Who doesnt want to be loved?. Im not here to demonstrate my style..</segment3>
		<segment4>Our void, our void,Your life, your life,</segment4>
		<segment5>This is what we're looking for, this is what were searching for, its about unconditional love. Three nails gave me life.     </segment5>
