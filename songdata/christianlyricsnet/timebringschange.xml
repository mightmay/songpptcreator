		<segment1>Why can't things be the. Way the used to be?. Why can't I feel the way; I. Used to feel? back in the. Days when it all worked. Out was it all in my. Mind? and now it won't. Come out when I don't. Think I'll get by when I. Fell that I need to cry it. Hurts me even more to. Think how it was before. No you first is how it. Always went the simple. Things made us content. We don't need nothin''. Except and the one true. God that keeps us. Together I hate time!. Cause time brings. Change! and change. Makes me start all over. Again I guess I can work. With time but does time work out</segment1>
