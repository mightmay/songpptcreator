		<segment1>Another sleepless night. I'm turning in my bed. Long before the red sun rises </segment1>
		<segment2>In these early hours. I'm falling again. Into the river of my worries </segment2>
		<segment3>When the river runs away. I find a shelter in your name </segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus, only light on the shore. Only hope in the storm. Jesus, let me fly to your side. There I would hide, Jesus </segment4>
		<segment5>Hear my anxious prayer. The beating of my heart. The pulse and the measure of my unbelief. Speak your words to me. Before I come apart. Help me believe in what I cannot see. Before the river runs away. I will call upon your name </segment5>
		<segment6>Jesus, only light on the shore. Only hope in the storm. Jesus, let me fly to your side. There I would hide, Jesus    </segment6>
