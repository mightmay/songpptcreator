		<segment1>You're like a lonely statue. the wind and rain comes at you. You'll stand and take your chances. against the world's advances. you rely on a flimsy virtue. no man can stand alone</segment1>
		<segment2>Does it offend you. that I got a friend who. knows what you've been through. and says that he loves you?</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to sing his name. of how he became. Jesus the friend of mine</segment3>
		<segment4>How long will you be posin'. How long can you stay frozen. You'll crumble from the inside. Your pride will be your demise. Won't you let someone help you. Everybody needs a friend.    </segment4>
