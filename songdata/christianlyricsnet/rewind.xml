		<segment1>Verse 1: Well I was chillin in the crib afterward reading my word/ so I cut the T.V. on and I started to surf/ at first I past a channel with a preacher man/ so I said let me go back just to see what he sayin/ reach to the left grabbed my Bible from the desk top/ he started off well Im like yeah thats hot/ dude was killin it/ I started feelin it/ even though I didnt know what scripture he was dealin with/ so I said let me stay and see/ then he said turn to Isaiah 53/ Im like aww yeah man that text is raw/ the very next thing he said made me drop my jaw/ I was appalled/ they offered him applause/ and 20,000 people screamin praise the Lord/ dawg Im like naw/ Im laughin it off but it was serious he was speakin on behalf of God</segment1>
		<segment2>Hook: Its time/ press stop and rewind/ go back roll back right now/ with creeds and church history/ lets stop and see if we missed a beat</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: He was reading verse 5 by His stripes we are healed/ then he said cause of that we should never get ill/ and if you do get sick its from a lack of faith/ this false teaching is really exasperating/ then he said either that or some secret sin/ so if your sickness comes back you need to seek Him again/ confess your hidden sin/ and beseech Him again/ and if you doubt your sickness will come creepin again/ so all that text was sayin is that we shouldnt get sick man/ is that in the bible/ that same preacher man said we suppose to be rich man/ is that in the bible/ he said with my faith I can confess and posses it/ is that in the bible/ then he said Gods people shouldnt suffer/ is that in the bible/ NO</segment3>
		<segment4>Hook</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 3: So I cut the T.V. off tear drop fallen to the floor/ I was sad seeing these people fallen for it/ I broke down then I started callin to the Lord/ we cant afford to ignore this anymore/ furthermore if he would have just read verse 4/ he would have understood the context a little more/ for that matter/ should have read the whole chapter/ to see the whole point that Isaiah was after/ the whole chapter was about Jesus Christ/ and specific details about Jesus life/ and healing in verse 5 was from our sin sickness/ you know when the Holy Ghost quickens/ I know what your feelin/ I know you offended/ but when you repented the Spirit brought spiritual healing/ but at the glorification/ in the book of Revelation/ chapter 21:4 read the no mores     </segment5>
