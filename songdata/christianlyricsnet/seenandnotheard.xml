		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on Matthew 7:3,5, James 1:2, Matthew 5:16</segment1>
		<segment2>Too many black sheep in the family. Too many stones from a house of glass. They've heard the story, they've heard the lines. But talk is too cheap to change their minds. They want to see some vital signs</segment2>
		<segment3>Convictions - in the way we live. Convictions - not a narrative. Actions speak a little louder than words</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). Seen and not heard, seen and not heard. Sometimes God's children should be seen and not heard. There's too much talk and not enought walk. Sometimes God's children should be seen and not heard</segment4>
		<segment5>Delayed reaction to hostility. Brings us into reality. Cause when we answer in our defense. They can see through the false pretense. They want to see some evidence</segment5>
		<segment6>Commitment - no more alibis. Commitment - not a compromise. Actions speak a little louder than words</segment6>
		<segment7>Let your light so shine in all you do. With an answer near when they come to you. Don't let your mouth start talkin'. Until your feet start walkin'     </segment7>
