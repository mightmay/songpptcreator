		<segment1>With my love and my sadness. I come before You Lord. My heart's in a thousand pieces. Maybe even more</segment1>
		<segment2>Yet I trust in this moment. You're with me somehow. And You've always been faithful. So Lord even now. Chorus: When all that I can sing. Is a broken hallelujah. When my only offering. Is shattered praise. Still a song of adoration. Will rise up from these ruins. I will worship You and give You thanks. Even when my only praise. Is a broken hallelujah</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh Father, You have given. Much more than I deserve. And I have felt Your hand of blessing. On me at every turn</segment3>
		<segment4>How could I doubt Your goodness. Your wisdom, Your grace. So Lord hear my heart. In this painful place</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Hallelujah. I lift my voice. Your Spirit moves. I raise my hands. I reach for You</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus    </segment7>
