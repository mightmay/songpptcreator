		<segment1>If you say I'm alive I guess I'm living. Why should I guess your size, a choice I've been given. Tell me everything's fine and peace is coming. I won't listen to the heartache I'm numbing </segment1>
		<segment2>When the world casts me down and says I've changed. I'll survive on all the promises you made to me. Guess there's no one to blame. When all you're living on is bread of shame. Bread of Shame. When the world says I've changed. Bread of shame. Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame </segment2>
		<segment3>As long as you say I'm free. Then keep these chains off me. Tell me down is up. I'll let you fill this broken cup. When the world fall down. Let them fall on me. Cause no one's around who believe me </segment3>
		<segment4>When the world casts me down and says I've changed. I'll survive on all the promises you made to me. Guess there's no one to blame. When all you're living on is bread of shame. Bread of Shame. When the world says I've changed. Bread of shame. Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame </segment4>
		<segment5>Tell me where I sign my name. Inside I find no peace of mind to hide behind. Only bread of shame. Tell me where I sign my name. Inside I have no peace of mind. Only bread of shame </segment5>
		<segment6>Bread of Shame. When the world says I've changed. Bread of Shame. Just promise me fame I'll survive on the bread of shame.     </segment6>
