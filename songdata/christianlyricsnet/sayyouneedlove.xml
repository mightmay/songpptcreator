		<segment1>you've been looking for shelter. on a cloudless day, there's no rain. you're keeping pennies in your pocket. for a bottle full of spare change, just in case. and if the glass ain't half empty then it's broken. it helps you escape from the pain. you throw the baby with the bath water. over and over again. turn the page </segment1>
		<segment2>you say you need love. tell me where does that get you. when push comes to shove. who you gonna run to. turn your eyes above. he unconditionally loves you. nothing you can say or do. will change his love for you </segment2>
		<segment3>heard it said you're an accident, biological mistake. so you're a love child, who could say it better. a physical grace, a perfect display </segment3>
		<segment4>has someone you trusted left you betrayed. has someone who loved you thrown love away. do you see God? does he have a face?. looks like your father's, how does it relate?. you're scared of being let down. tell me </segment4>
		<segment5>don't be afraid. don't shy away. he'll never leave you. he won't forsake. don't be afraid. don't shy away. he's not gonna leave you    </segment5>
