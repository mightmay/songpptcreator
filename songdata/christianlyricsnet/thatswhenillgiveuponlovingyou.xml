		<segment1>No heartbeat is always steady. Angels have halos already. Please- don't think you're proving. Yourself all the time. I don't need you to be perfect. I know the wait will be worth it. You and me baby we're only just. Learning to shine</segment1>
		<segment2>You should know. This my love. How far I'll go. Here's when I'll give up</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. When the sun is coming up at midnight. When the clocks have all run out of time. When the snow- falls in june. That's when I'll give up (on loving you). When the earth is finished spinning around. When it's raining up instead of down. When a dream-can't come true. When the rivers all run out of blue. That's when I'll give up (on loving you)</segment3>
		<segment4>You'll never run out of chances. I don't need you to have all the answers. Love isn't something that has to be. Put to the test</segment4>
		<segment5>Love like this. Can't be undone. I'm telling you. If the day should come</segment5>
		<segment6>[Repeat Chorus]</segment6>
		<segment7>As you're walking through the world. You gotta know. I'll be with you everywhere you go. You can spread your wings or run. Back to my arms. I will always hold you in my heart- baby</segment7>
		<segment8>You'll always be. A part of me. Baby can't you see</segment8>
		<segment9>[Repeat Chorus].     </segment9>
