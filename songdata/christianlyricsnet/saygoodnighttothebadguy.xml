		<segment1>Now here I lie in the street. An invitation for you to steal a glance at me. While all the village, it gathers. To watch the vultures devour this decaying matter</segment1>
		<segment2>Come one, come all, (hey, hey, hey). Whoever wants a taste of me take it for free (2x)</segment2>
		<segment3>You wanna, You wanna, You wanna, You wanna. Now everyone can say good night to the bad guy</segment3>
		<segment4>The children fiend for the spoils. Divide what remains before it sinks in the soil. With a gash below the waste. Out it came like milk for everyone to taste. But now it's curdled and sour. Ripe for your stomach to turn in about an hour</segment4>
		<segment5>Come one, come all, (hey, hey, hey). Whoever wants a taste of me take it for free (2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>You wanna, You wanna, You wanna, You wanna. Now everyone can say good night to the bad guy (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>Just for a minute pretend. In this illusion that we were ever friends. Nothing is more expensive. Yet it's been given to you at such a bargain. But now the serum is sour. 'Cause I was never here for you to devour</segment7>
		<segment8>Come one, come all, (hey, hey, hey). Whoever wants a taste of me take it for free (2x)</segment8>
		<segment9>You wanna, You wanna, You wanna, You wanna. Now everyone can say good night to the bad guy (2x)    </segment9>
