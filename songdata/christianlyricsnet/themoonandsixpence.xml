		<segment1>If you would untie the knots on your boats. I promise you that I could lie. Neptuenn has changed and I needed to loose. The rest of the bodies at sea. I have waited for too long, for too long. Downstairs. I heard everyone speak. So soft. What plans they had made to bend there arms&amp;#8309;. Several more traps that I set to speed. Poles that would twist every limb. Several more marble and curving displays. Rise up the Gardens in fate. Downstairs. I heard everyone speak. So soft. What plans they had made to bend their arms. Dreams I have always. Dreams I have always had. Lightning across walls. I knew you had to last. Lift up and see your death. And so our character escapes that dreary house as silently as possible, but only to find the Neon City..    </segment1>
