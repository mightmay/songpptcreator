		<segment1>There's a light on the corner. It says I'd wish you'd come in. Unless you've got a place to go. So through the lines on the left. I can't hear what you say. All I hear are the tom tom drums</segment1>
		<segment2>There's a drive by the lake. Where the fields get white. With the smell of the drum. Through the lights there's a calm. That I wish you could see. But we've got to go go go</segment2>
		<segment3>We never played it right. And we'll never play it right</segment3>
		<segment4>There's some lins in the songs. That I never get tight. I can't rely on the good past leads. Like every man there's a calm. That I wish I could see. But we've got to go go go</segment4>
		<segment5>We never played it right. And we'll never play it right    </segment5>
