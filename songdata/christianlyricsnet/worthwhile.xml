		<segment1>And it all takes place in the heart. These dire times, these dire times. Hope has the answers. It's a work in progress that tears like self-demise. It can't be won, a never ending battle for the finish line. This will is yours, this will is mine. Change can set the focus for you and I. These is more outside, so much more to know. And it's imperative that it's seen this way. A love that cures, a love that's pure. It might be all we need to tear down the ideas of mankind. Don't you think we can do anything. It's the world we made. It's due for change. It all takes place in the heart. I will labor at your door, but I will labor not in vain. Hope has the answers. For this I labor, I'll labor not in vain. For this I labor, I will labor not in vain    </segment1>
