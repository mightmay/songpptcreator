	<english>
		<segment1>When time shall slip its cog in place. And spin its line of lovely lace. Then love and peace come face to face. One of these days</segment1>
		<segment2>When sorrow can nowhere be found. And greed shall lay its weapons down. And hate give up without a sound. One of these days</segment2>
		<segment3>When love by tender instrument. Through circumstance and incident. Shall peace and joy again invent. One of these days</segment3>
		<segment4>To see this from within the soul. We must be patient and consoled. To know the joy that's ours to hold. One of these days</segment4>
		<segment5>And so with earnest inward eyes. We man the post where duty lies. And seek to win the precious prize. One of these days</segment5>
		<segment6>One of these days..    </segment6>
