		<segment1>I remember times I had. Some were happy, some were sad. Memories me and my partners in crime. Throwing up a thousand times. I got through it, I feel fine. I went to school and did my time. In a sense I'm out, in a sense I'm free. To be what I wanna be. Fun was cartoons Saturdays. Fun was staying up past eight. Lame was tring to fit in. Lame was the wrong crowd let me it. YOu gotta stick together. With who you are and who you know. You gotta remember. Where you've been and where you wanna go. I never did homework after school. Did all the things I thought were cool. Went out every Friday night. I still do and I'm alright.     </segment1>
