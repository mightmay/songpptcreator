		<segment1>VERSE 1. Keep my heart amazed. Let me see Your wonders every day. Teach me in Your ways. So that I may fear. You are walking on water. You are calling me after. You are standing beside me now</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. You are the Maker of Heaven. You turn my world around. You're making all things new again. Through it all I know. You are God alone</segment2>
		<segment3>VERSE 2. Set my heart on fire. Let me burn. With passion for Your name. Take over my life. I surrender now</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are God alone.     </segment4>
