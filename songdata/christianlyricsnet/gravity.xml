		<segment1>Tryna' make it to heaven, stuck on the moon. How beautiful earth is from this point of view. So much evil back on the ground. Gravity keeps on bringing me down (down down down)</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah.. Whoohhh ahhhh (Bringing me down). Yeah.. ahhh .. Yeah</segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse 1:]. [?] just have to let my light shine. Like the sun that aluminates the sky so bright. Like the stars that chase away the dawn this night. Church by it would be whoah like the moon that flow, let's go. Lord, I want to be where you are. But in my flesh Lord, I can only go so far. It's like a test, every time I try to raise the bar. I want to worship, really, but it's too much gravity </segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus: ]. Tryna' make it to heaven, stuck on the moon. How beautiful earth is from this point of view. So much evil back on the ground. Gravity keeps on bringing me down. So much hatred, famine and wars. I don't want to go back anymore. Wanna share with the world the peace that I found. But gravity keeps on bring me down. Gravity.. Keeps bringing me down. Gravity.. Keeps bringing me down. Gravity.. Keeps bringing me down. Gravity.. Keeps bringing me down </segment4>
		<segment5>[Verse 2: ]. If I can just fly away. From the negative energy that's strongest my faith. Get on a space ship, take a trip thru space. Go with me sight seeing thru the milky way. How did you make Pluto, Jupiter and Mars. Only you can make Venus, Neptune and Stars. And [?] makes me feel like I can just surf in gravity. Brings me way back down to Earth </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus]</segment6>
		<segment7>Yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah ehhh    </segment7>
