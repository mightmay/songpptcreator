		<segment1>There's so much on my mind lately. I can't make out my own thoughts anymore. I don't know where one begins and the other one ends. I wish that I could push a button. And turn it all off just for a little while. Long enough to take a breath and then I'll know </segment1>
		<segment2>It'll be OK. It'll be alright </segment2>
		<segment3>There's so much that needs done lately. I can't make out what's important anymore. I don't know where my needs begin and someone else's ends. I don't wanna let anybody down cause. I feel like I'm falling down when I do. But for now would someone else please volunteer to say </segment3>
		<segment4>It'll be OK. It'll be alright </segment4>
		<segment5>Life is hard for everyone so let's blow it all off just for a Little while. Let's take a break it'll still be there when we get back. I always try to solve all our problems by. Working real hard going just another mile. But every now and then I think we should let it go and say </segment5>
		<segment6>It'll be OK. It'll be alright </segment6>
		<segment7>This is my last verse and it's for everyone feeling not so great Today. We don't know what's coming just around the bend. Always hard to believe in your own life easier to find belief From a friend. I'll hope for you, you for me. And together we can say </segment7>
		<segment8>It'll be OK. It'll be alright    </segment8>
