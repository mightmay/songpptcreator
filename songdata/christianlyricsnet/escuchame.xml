		<segment1>You in the mirror. I've been spying on you. I see a girl, whose world. Is broken in two. I get the picture. That you grew up too fast. You've got your dreams, it seems. And more than you asked</segment1>
		<segment2>Oo you're fading. Oo you're wearing thin. Oo you're breaking</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Escuchame - let me save you some pain. Escuchame - I will show you the way. Mirame - you will be me someday. Baby don't make the same mistakes..escuchame</segment3>
		<segment4>I've got a secret. That'll carry you through. There is a God who loves. To look after you. Hey little sister. Don't worry no more. Just come with me, you see. I've been there before</segment4>
		<segment5>Oo the heartbreaks. Oo the lessons learned. Oo I know what it takes</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge: Words of wisdom. Can you hear them?</segment7>
		<segment8>Repeat chorus    </segment8>
