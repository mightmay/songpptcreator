		<segment1>I used to be making future plans. As I would dance. At your funeral that's me. The superman I always wanted to be. Pretending blindness. I didn't want to find this. Something I left behind. But always with me. Somehow protecting me. Somehow trying to convince. This blind man to see</segment1>
