		<segment1>You took the part, hoping that it would be your break. Then you prayed to God you'd say your lines right. You looked so nice, cause you covered your face with maybeline. And hoped the light would make you shine</segment1>
		<segment2>But you feel just like a puppet. Cause they're pulling all your strings. And you've become the person you swore you'd never be</segment2>
		<segment3>Then the sky opens up. And the angels float down. They're singing, Heaven cover Angeline tonight. All over the Los Angeles. The lights are going down. And they're singing heaven cover Angeline tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>So you ride the wave, cause everything is going fine today. Then you take a breath and wait for the next set. You write your name, and you cover the phrases with your tears. Cause maybe the water will blur the truth out</segment4>
		<segment5>And you say that you're a loner. But I know you hate to be alone. And you say that you can't take it. Not one more day, not one more day</segment5>
		<segment6>Then the sky opens up. And the angels float down. They're singing, Heaven cover Angeline tonight. All over the Los Angeles. The lights are going down. And they're singing heaven cover Angeline tonight</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge: Look at you, you're perfection in the making. Just look at you, you're believing all they're saying. You're gonna be fine tonight    </segment7>
