		<segment1>I saw the rain fall down today, Watch lightning crash through skies of grey, Why can't life just be polite, and wait.. </segment1>
		<segment2>I saw the lights outside your house, Red lights cut like nothin' else, The scene of a silent cry for help</segment2>
		<segment3>How are we supposed to do this?. If everyone we love, still lets us down, If you're there, can you hear me now?</segment3>
		<segment4>No matter how hard I try, Can't get you out of my mind, Wish I could be there to help you say goodbye. Don't hold it inside, 'cause what's left can be right, What's left can be right</segment4>
		<segment5>I saw the sky go black today, I felt your tears, and ached your pain, It's hard to tell how much this changed, How you see everything. And all I can do is pray, That you don't take the blame, 'Cause it's not your fault, that it happened this way, Happened this way</segment5>
		<segment6>How are we supposed to do this?. If everyone we love, still lets us down, If you're there, can you hear me now?</segment6>
		<segment7>No matter how hard I try, Can't get you out of my mind, Wish I could be there to help you say goodbye. Don't hold it inside, 'cause what's left can be right, What's left can be right    </segment7>
