		<segment1>Your masses, they come in droves, assemblies of misguided bones. Oh the blessings, with just enough faith. Their healings pass by with the plate.. plate.</segment1>
		<segment2>Manipulate the people for a show, destruction to the Kingdom as you grow.</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;Depart from me, I never knew you.&quot; &quot;Depart from me, I never knew you.&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>You will build your house on sand. The rain will descend, the floods will come.</segment4>
		<segment5>Great will be your houses fall. Great will be your houses fall. Great will be your houses fall. Great will be your houses fall.    </segment5>
