		<segment1>The time has come for me. To leave this place of complacency. And step out across that line. To the place where I. Can leave all that I have behind. And give you this heart of mine</segment1>
		<segment2>But what if I'm the only one. to break the silence. What if I'm the only one. to crack the ice</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). I'll join the rocks in their singing. I'll join the ocean as it harmonizes with the shore. I'll clap my hands with the mountains. As all creation cries for more. I'll never stop, if I'm the last one living. Your song goes on and on and I must testify. I know that I was born to worship. So if all the singing seems to stop. I'll join the rocks</segment3>
		<segment4>My ship is sailing now. Into an ocean and I can't tell. What's on the other side. But I know if I don't leave. My heart will never forgive me. And I'll be left behind</segment4>
		<segment5>But what if I'm the only one. to see there's more to this. What if we have just begun to. scratch the surface</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus)</segment8>
		<segment9>Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah    </segment9>
