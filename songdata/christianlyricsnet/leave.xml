I used to think of talking, talking to my preacher. He says I should just forgive and forget. Now my baby brother just sits and recollects the same regret</segment1>
		<segment2>And I just wanna leave. Oh, God, please help me now. I wanna leave</segment2>
		<segment3>As if thats not enough, were the new family around here. Guess thats all the reason some kids need. Cause they all call me names and. Say I should just take it on the chin. If Im overreacting, then why is it so cold here. Why is it so cold here in this hell. Why would my friend Suzie tell me I should just go kill myself</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, I wanna get out of here. Oh, God, help me now. I really wanna believe</segment4>
