		<segment1>Complain about everything that we have to say. equality is preached from every band. when your not like us it's okay to change your stand. You wouldn't risk hurting your reputation. to come and talk to me. So your run your mouth. like you know what we're about. Never willing to sit. and work things out. I should not have expected any more from you. I thought equality is something that you knew. I have given out more chances than what was due. I will think again before I trust you. HUMAN.    </segment1>
