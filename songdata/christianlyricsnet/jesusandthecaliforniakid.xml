		<segment1>Jesus and the California Kid. oh what Jesus did, for the California kid </segment1>
		<segment2>There's a school kid on the coastline. who's the textbook case of cool. He's out of sight he surfs alright. and he ain't nobody's fool. He's got a face that fits on GQ. and a natural taste in style. And everybody likes hime. with that million dollar smile </segment2>
		<segment3>Well you might think he parties. and gets and girl he want. And he hangs out with the wicked. but he needs no silly stunts. He got a different kind of attitude. that most cool dudes don't have. He's got a personal life with Jesus. and he walks on the narrow path </segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus and the California Kid. oh what Jesus did, for the California kid </segment4>
		<segment5>One time God became a man. and He walked upon the earth. He didn't have a cool car. and I don't think he liked to surf. But he mst of had something in common. to do what He did. 'Cause He died for you and I. and He died for the California Kid </segment5>
		<segment6>Jesus and the California Kid. oh what Jesus did, for the California kid.     </segment6>
