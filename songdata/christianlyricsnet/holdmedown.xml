		<segment1>I'm starting to see things more clearly now. The wheel will always turn. Spinning inward to my core. And as I approach I can see You now. Your arms are open. A comfort like I've never felt before</segment1>
		<segment2>So here I am. Do with me what you will. But am I strong enough?</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: I'm letting go of all the things I know that will. Hold me down, hold me down. Don't hold me down, hold me down. And say goodbye to the things that I know will. Hold me down, hold me down. Don't hold me down, hold me down to earth</segment3>
		<segment4>I've done what I wanted and as I pleased. But it's never been enough. It left me cold and all alone. And now that I feel You come over me. I know yes, I know that Your here. Here with me</segment4>
		<segment5>So here I am. Do with me what You will. But am I strong enough?</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>Letting go, Letting go. Letting go, Letting go</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS</segment8>
		<segment9>Letting go, Letting go. Letting go, Letting..     </segment9>
