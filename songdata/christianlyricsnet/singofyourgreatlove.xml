		<segment1>All that is within me Lord will bless Your holy name, I live my life to wor-ship You alone. You brought me out of darkness,and in-to Your glorious light. Forever I will sing of Your great love. Forever I will sing of Your great love.</segment1>
		<segment2>VERSE 2: I love to see You glorified, to see You lifted high, I yearn to see all na-tions bow their-knee. It's You alone Lord Jesus who can cause the coldest heart. To find Your love and everlasting peace. To find Your love and everlasting-peace.</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Ho-ly, Ho-ly, Ho-ly is the-Lord. Ho-ly, Ho-ly, Ho-ly is the-Lord.</segment3>
		<segment4>VERSE 3: And Your trumpet will sound, And all of heaven will know. That the time has finally come. For the bride to take her place. And we'll hear the angels-sing.     </segment4>
