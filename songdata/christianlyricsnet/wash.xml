		<segment1>Never meant to waste your time. never meant to fall out of line. I was trying to get closer to you. Now it seems with every step. feels like I'm losing my breath. I don't know what else I can do</segment1>
		<segment2>but you wash over me. you wash over me like rain. and you wash over me. you wash over me like sunshine</segment2>
		<segment3>I never had to choose. living a life with you. or chasing lies only half true. when our love would be. a world alone with you and me. than hiding behind these walls</segment3>
		<segment4>when you wash over me. you wash over me like rain. and you wash over me. you wash over me like sunshine. and you wash over me. you wash over me like rain. and you fall over me. you crawl over me. like sunshine. like sunshine</segment4>
		<segment5>Everything in the world was falling through. all I knew was it led to you. my sunshine. all my life never found my place. until I felt the sunlight on my face. my sunshine</segment5>
		<segment6>Never meant to waste your time. never meant to fall out of line. I was trying to get closer to you. Now it seems with every step. feels like I'm losing my breath. I don't know what else I can do</segment6>
		<segment7>but you wash over me. you wash over me like rain. and you wash over me. you wash over me like sunshine. and you wash over me. you wash over me like rain. and you fall into me. you crawl into me. like sunshine. like sunshine. like sunshine. like sunshine    </segment7>
