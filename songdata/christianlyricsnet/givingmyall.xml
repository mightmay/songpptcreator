		<segment1>Everyday I face my fears. Will I make it through the years of all the pressures, All the bad times that come my way. And then there's the enemy around. Who wants to make me lose my ground for earthly treasures. All the wrong paths that I could take. But I've decided that my goal. Is to give you sole control and to love you. Because you've done just so much for me. Oh, you've set my spirit free. And you've cared so faithfully I want to know you. And everything that you are. Chorus: I am giving my all to you. Tryin' to do the best I can to make sure that I do your plan. I'm giving my life to you. Gave me life and set me free you put your light inside of me. I never knew life could be so tough. Or that this race would be so rough, but though I struggle. I know I'll be alright in the end. 'Cause every time that I fall down. You have always been around to be near me. To wrap me in your arms again. How you shower me with grace. Every time I see your face and you love me. So that I don't want to do wrong. So to you I sing this song and I pray for help. To keep on goin', never stop. (chorus). Oh, through my life's story, I want to give you glory. Life tries to bring me down, for your love I'll stand my ground. Your heart has received me, and you will never leave me. No time to play the games, now that I know that you came to save me. (chorus out).     </segment1>
