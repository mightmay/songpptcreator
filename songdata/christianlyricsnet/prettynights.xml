		<segment1>Pace is picking up. Tempo changing slowly gradually hardly noticeable. One beat per minute becomes two and two makes four. Now where is that door</segment1>
		<segment2>To reality check me out and in and out of this motel rooms. It's unbelievable is this retrievable. I think I better leave</segment2>
		<segment3>Pretty nights flashing photo lights. I feel all right as long as smiles are shining bright. What a game what a night. I feel all right I said. Pretty nights pretty nights but got nothing to say</segment3>
		<segment4>Who touched the volume knob. Has it always been this loud. Allowed it to go from one. Does this one go to eleven. I think I better leave</segment4>
		<segment5>Nothing is silent except the thoughts in my head. And all those words have been said. Feels unbelievable are they retrievable. Because all I do is scream to overpower this noise</segment5>
		<segment6>Pretty nights flashing photo lights. I feel all right as long as smiles are shining bright. What a game what a night. I feel all right I said. Pretty nights pretty nights but got nothing to say</segment6>
		<segment7>Pace is picking up tempo changing the common normal. Normalized us and paralyzed us and left us with a sadness. And now it's hovering in the air in between our eyes. I know we can find our way around. Around if we can only find the time. Time we don't have but that has been given</segment7>
		<segment8>Pretty nights flashing photo lights. I feel all right as long as smiles are shining bright. What a game what a night. I feel all right I said. Pretty nights pretty nights but got nothing to say    </segment8>
