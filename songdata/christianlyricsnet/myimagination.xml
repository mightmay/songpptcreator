		<segment1>Imagine. If there were no no expectations. If there was no no confidence. If there were no no convictions. If there was no no disappointment.</segment1>
		<segment2>Why cant you see what I see, this is reality.</segment2>
		<segment3>Imagine. If there were no no excuses. If there was no no compassion. If there was no no forgiveness. If there was no no guiltiness.</segment3>
		<segment4>Why can't you see what I see, this is reality.</segment4>
		<segment5>I see the necessity of all these values, but we have to use them in the right way. I know it's hard to hold on to these ideals, but if I'm too weak, God will push me through.     </segment5>
