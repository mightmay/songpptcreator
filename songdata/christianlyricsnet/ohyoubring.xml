		<segment1>Oh, You bring hope to the hopeless. And light to those in the darkness. And death to life, now I'm alive. Oh, You give peace to the restless. And joy to homes that are broken. I see You now, in You I'm found</segment1>
		<segment2>And You opened the door for me. And You laid down Your life to set me free. All that I am will serve You, Lord. (You, Lord). Oh, You fill those who are empty. And rescue those in the valley. And through it all You calm my soul. Oh, You find me in my weakness. And heal the wounds of my heartache. I worship You in Spirit and truth</segment2>
		<segment3>And You opened my eyes to see. All the wonder and awe of Christ in me. Jesus, You're everything I need</segment3>
		<segment4>All honour. All glory. All praise to You    </segment4>
