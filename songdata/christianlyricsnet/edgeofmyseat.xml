		<segment1>Nothing more. That there's nothing more. Nothing more. That there's nothing more </segment1>
		<segment2>Nothing here's the same, it's all a dream. Life on the movie screen. And I'm sitting on the edge of my seat </segment2>
		<segment3>I can't tell what happens next, just what I've seen. I don't know what it means. But I'm holding on the edge of my seat </segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause I can't forget your name, forget your name. Yeah I can't forget you now. I know I can't forget you, girl </segment4>
		<segment5>I promise. Sit back buckle in and hold on tight. A roller coaster ride. And I'm holding on the edge of my seat </segment5>
		<segment6>And I can't know for sure. 'Cause I just landed on your shore. But I think you got nothing but another thing coming. If you think there's nothing more. That there's nothing more </segment6>
		<segment7>I can't forget your name, forget your name. Yeah I can't forget you now. I know I can't forget you girl </segment7>
		<segment8>I can't forget your name, forget your name. Yeah I can't forget you now. I know I can't forget you, can't forget you girl </segment8>
		<segment9>I can't forget your name, forget your name. Yeah I can't forget you now. I know I can't forget you girl     </segment9>
