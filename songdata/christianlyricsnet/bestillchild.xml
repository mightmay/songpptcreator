		<segment1>I said my goodbyes to the sun. my little one, so far away. And how strange, how small we must become. yet as familiar as yesterday </segment1>
		<segment2>The bluest iris that I'd ever seen. SHe vanished like a dream, sinking back. into the ground. Singing &quot;maybe I wept real tears&quot;. but maybe she was hiding because she wanted to be found. You wanted to be found! </segment2>
		<segment3>Don't be afraid of him. Be still.     </segment3>
