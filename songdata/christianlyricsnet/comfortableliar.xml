		<segment1>Prime, the listless sea. The salts enters the wounds. My take on you is simple</segment1>
		<segment2>So heal your fear. To heal your fear</segment2>
		<segment3>Time spent waiting offshore. The calm before the storm. My take from you is simple</segment3>
		<segment4>So heal your fear. To heal your fear</segment4>
		<segment5>You're such a comfortable liar. You're such a comfortable liar. You're such a comfortable liar. You're such a comfortable liar. You're such a comfortable liar. You're so calm</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause I said &quot;Wrong!&quot;. You comfortable liar. You comfortable liar. You comfortable liar. You comfortable liar. Liar!    </segment6>
