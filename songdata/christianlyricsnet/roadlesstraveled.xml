		<segment1>I've been standin' here a while. Looking down these dusty roads. The long one seems like at least another mile. Or I could follow the crowd and hope it leads me home</segment1>
		<segment2>But you've been here with me so far. To follow You means to journey on. And You've promised that the long road would be hard. But You've also promised I won't face it on my own</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). I will take the road less traveled. I will follow where You lead. For I know You've gone before me. To meet my need. And the road less traveled. Will make the difference in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Choices come and then they go. And leave our hearts somewhere in between. Some may haunt us while others offer hope. Still we make decisions that determine who we'll be</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>(Bridge). I know I'm not alone. You always walk with me. And I'll go down any road. If I can hear You calling me, calling me</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>.     </segment8>
