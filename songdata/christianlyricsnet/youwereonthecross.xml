		<segment1>Lost, everything is lost. And everything I've loved before is gone. Alone like the coming of the frost. And a cold winter's chill in my stony heart</segment1>
		<segment2>And where were You when all that I've hoped for?. Where You when all that I've dreamed?. Came crashing down in shambles around me. You were on the cross</segment2>
		<segment3>Pain, could you take away the pain?. If I find someone to blame, would it make my life seem easier?. Alone, all my friends are asleep. And I can't find anyone to stay awake with me</segment3>
		<segment4>Where were You when sin stole my innocence?. Where were You when I was ashamed?. Hiding in a life, I wish, I never made</segment4>
		<segment5>You were on the cross, my God, my God, alone, alone. You were on the cross, You died for us, alone, alone. You were on the cross, victorious, alone, alone</segment5>
		<segment6>You were there in all of my suffering. And You were there in doubt and in fear. I'm waiting on the dawn to reappear    </segment6>
