		<segment1>A day in LA. And millions of faces. Are looking for movement. 'Cause everything's stuck. And everything's frozen. And everyone's broken. And nobody moves. And everyone's scared. That the motion will never come </segment1>
		<segment2>This is the incompletion. Stuck in a line </segment2>
		<segment3>Love is the movement. Love is a revolution. This is redemption. We don't have to slow back down </segment3>
		<segment4>The stars are alive. They dance to the music. Of the deepest emotion. And all of the world. Is singing in time. As the heavens are caving in. Mysterious ways. Why God gave His life. To put motion inside my soul </segment4>
		<segment5>It's bigger than cold religion. It's bigger than life </segment5>
		<segment6>We're starting now. We don't have to slow back down </segment6>
		<segment7>This is a revolution.     </segment7>
