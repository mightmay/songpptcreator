		<segment1>Well, I've been runnin' down the road. Tryin' to loosen my load. I got seven women on my mind. Four that want to own me. Two that want to stone me. One says she's a friend of mine</segment1>
		<segment2>Take it easy.. Take it easy.. Don't let the sound of your own wheels. Drive you crazy. Lighten up while you still can. Don't even try to understand. Just find a place to make your stand. And take it easy..</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, I've been standin' on a corner. In Winslow, Arizona. Such a fine sight to see. It's a girl, my Lord. In a flatbed Ford. Slowin' down to take a look at me</segment3>
		<segment4>So come on, baby.. Don't say maybe.. I got to know if your sweet love. Is gonna save me. We may lose and we may win. But we will never be here again. So open up I'm climbin' in. And take it easy.. Yeah</segment4>
		<segment5>Whoa..</segment5>
		<segment6>Well, I've been runnin' down the road. Tryin' to loosen my load. I got a wealth of trouble on my mind. Lookin' for a lover. Who won't blow my cover. She's so hard to find</segment6>
		<segment7>Take it easy.. Take it easy.. Don't let the sound of your own wheels. Make you crazy. Come on, baby.. Don't say maybe.. I got to know if your sweet love. Is gonna save..me..</segment7>
		<segment8>(Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..). (Ooh, ooh, ooh..)</segment8>
