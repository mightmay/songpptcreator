		<segment1>Under the galaxy, the whole. And over the casting and the ROE. You work the turning world. Golden Arrows. Slipping further away from me. Golden Arrows. Slipping young ones in darker sleeps. Out of the shutters and the sills. And within the mourning and the chills. You work the turning world.. Down, down, down. Where are the stirrings of old?. I knew you had to last. But then the sound is heard..    </segment1>
