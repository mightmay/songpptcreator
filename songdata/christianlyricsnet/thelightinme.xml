		<segment1>My life before You. I was a flame burning down. I was burning out. But You knew me better. For You there was never a doubt. Not since You gave me life</segment1>
		<segment2>Something was different. I knew it the instant. You put the light in me</segment2>
		<segment3>The spark. The shot to the heart. You are the hope that leads me. Out of the dark. You let Your love shine down. So that the world can see. You put the light in me. The light, You put the light in me. The light, You put the light in me. The light, You put the light in me. The light, You put the light in me</segment3>
		<segment4>You are the Maker. You tell the sun when to rise. I'm just a house on a hill. But You make me brighter. Than all the stars in the sky. Keep me from growing dim</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause in Your perfection. I'm just a reflection. So pull me closer to You. I'll catch like a fire. And I'll hold You higher. Cause You put the light in me</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll raise it high, I'll let it show. From the roof tops down to the streets below. In day and night, You will be known. And all will see. You put the light in me    </segment6>
