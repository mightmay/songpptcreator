		<segment1>I know my Father made you mad. In your eyes I see the end</segment1>
		<segment2>Do your knees shake at the thought of those dark clouds. They're rolling in</segment2>
		<segment3>And I hear the trumpets wail. Israel Armageddon begin</segment3>
		<segment4>Let Him see your hands outstretched. To Him</segment4>
		<segment5>This time your blood will run. This time your blood will run dry</segment5>
		<segment6>And who are you spitting at. And who are you spitting at</segment6>
		<segment7>Bring Your glory. Bring Your fire. Bring Your blood. Bring Zion. I wanna see it. Your face. I wanna feel You. When fire burns. It's from the sky. When fire burns. The sky</segment7>
		<segment8>It's over. When fire burns. It's over. And it's from the sky. It's over. When fire burns. It's over. The sky</segment8>
		<segment9>And let the blood fall. Let it fall here. And let the blood fall. Let his blood fall here    </segment9>
