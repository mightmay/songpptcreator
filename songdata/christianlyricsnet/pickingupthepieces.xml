		<segment1>Open my eyes, my life is scattered on the floor. I walked away from you so long that I could not hear your voice. Oh my tears that I cried I left them laying on your heart. And now I'm here with you again, can we pick up from the start. </segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). All I have and all I need is everything You gave to me. I bitter way so now I'm picking up the paices once again.</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm falling to my knees that is where I saw Your hand. I've been here way too many times, I can't belive You'd take me back. And all the tears that I've cried, Never touched the ground and. Now I'm here with what is left. Will You build me up again?</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus x2)    </segment4>
