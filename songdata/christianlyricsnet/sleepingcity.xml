		<segment1>The black of night is closing in around you. The crippling fear moves in as they strap you down. Will you let a moment get the best of you. Will this situation bring you around</segment1>
		<segment2>When the blood stains dry. Will it bring you around. Will it pass you by</segment2>
		<segment3>Right now you're bruised and bleeding. I see the hurt within your eyes. I know your pain is for a reason. You need to feel just to know that You're alive</segment3>
		<segment4>The days have turned to weeks but it's not over</segment4>
		<segment5>The bandages rewind you to where you've been. These memories will remind you. When life takes you out will it bring you around</segment5>
		<segment6>When it's said and done. Will it bring you around. What will you become</segment6>
		<segment7>Right now you're bruised and bleeding. I see the hurt within your eyes. I know your pain is for a reason. You need to feel just to know that You're alive</segment7>
