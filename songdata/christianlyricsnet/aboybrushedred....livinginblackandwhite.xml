Can you feel your heartbeat racing?. Can you taste the fear in her sweat?. You've done this wrong. It's too far gone. These sheets tell of regret. I admit that I'm just a fool for you. I am just a fool for you. Here is where we both feel wrong. Tonight's your last chance to. Do exactly what you want to. And this could be my night. This is what makes me feel alive. Makes you feel alive. Here is where we both go wrong. So tie me up. And toss this key. 'Cause for now we're living in this moment. And we both ignore the truth. It's all over. It's all over. I feel your heart against mine. So take a breath and close your eyes. (chorus). Your lungs have failed and they both stopped breathing. My heart is dead and its way past beating. Something has gone terribly wrong. I'm scared, you're scared, we're scared of this. I never thought we'd make it out alive. I never told you but its all in your goodbyes. It's all in your goodbyes. Well look who's dying now. Slit wrists and sleeping with the girl next door. I always knew you were such a sucker for that. It doesnt matter what you say. You never mattered anyway. I never mattered anyway. In this moment that we both ignore the truth. It's all over. It's all over. I feel your heart against mine. So take a breath and close your eyes. (chorus). Don't shake, i hate to see you tremble-trembling . You've lost your touch haven't you. And I'm so addicted
