		<segment1>We could talk for hours. It doesn't matter. You don't hear a word I say. 'Cause you don't listen when I speak. So I'll sing instead </segment1>
		<segment2>La la la la la I love you. Ooh.. I really do. If you ever paid attention. I think you would love me too </segment2>
		<segment3>You say you want to know me. I get the feeling that you're telling me a lie. 'Cause every time I talk about emotion. You shake your pretty head and say goodbye </segment3>
		<segment4>La la la la la I love you. Ooh.. I really do. If you ever paid attention. I think you would love me </segment4>
		<segment5>Why do I love you like I do. When you ignore me. Just like the sun ignores the moon. All you see is you </segment5>
		<segment6>I love you. Ooh, sad but true. If you ever paid attention. I think you would love me too </segment6>
		<segment7>I love you. Ooh.. I really do. If you ever paid attention. I think you would love me too. Love me too. Love me too    </segment7>
