		<segment1>You're worth so much. It'll never be enough. To see what you have to give. How beautiful you are. Yet seem so far from everything. You're wanting to be. You're wanting to be</segment1>
		<segment2>Tears falling down again. Tears falling down</segment2>
		<segment3>You fall to your knees. You beg, you plead. Can I be somebody else. For all the times I hate myself?. Your failures devour your heart. In every hour, you're drowning. In your imperfection</segment3>
		<segment4>You mean so much. That heaven would touch. The face of humankind for you. How special you are. Revel in your day. You're fearfully and wonderfully made. You're wonderfully made</segment4>
		<segment5>Tears falling down again. Come let the healing begin</segment5>
		<segment6>You fall to your knees. You beg, you plead. Can I be somebody else. For all the times I hate myself?. Your failures devour your heart. In every hour, you're drowning. In your imperfection</segment6>
		<segment7>You're worth so much. So easily crushed. Wanna be like everyone else. No one escapes. Every breath we take. Dealing with our own skeletons, skeletons</segment7>
		<segment8>You fall to your knees. You beg, you plead. Can I be somebody else. For all the times I hate myself?. Your failures devour your heart. In every hour, you're drowning. In your imperfection</segment8>
		<segment9>Won't you believe, yeah. Won't you believe, yeah. All the things I see in you</segment9>
		<segment10>You're not the only one. You're not the only one. Drowning in imperfection</segment10>
		<segment11>    </segment11>
