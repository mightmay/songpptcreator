		<segment1>The roof caved in. And the walls crumbled. And there I stood exposed. Clutching my chest in fear. How'd I end up here. Bad decisions. One right after the other. Moved like waves pulled by the moon. Like a puppet who's tugged on by string. Like water tumbling down stream. I was lost</segment1>
		<segment2>Blind man, deaf boy. And the Lover of me. And were did it lead to. I fought for air as I was drowning. In that rushing stream. As the water poured over me</segment2>
		<segment3>Off the bridge i threw my heart. As if it didn't matter. I walked the edge so fearlessly. Blindfolded by my lustful eyes. Deafened by a string of lies. But You saw me there. In my same condition. Your eyes held me in Your stare. You gazed into my empty soul. Spoke the words the burned a hole. In my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>Blind man, deaf boy. Now see and hear. Did you think that I'd not find you. Don't you know that I'm the lover souls. And I came to be near. From this very earth I made you</segment4>
		<segment5>Some of us like sheep have gone astray. Some of us like fools live for today. And then it's gone. And you're left with nothing. You fight to hold it all inside your hands. Somehow we think we'll understand. What no eye has ever seen and no mind comprehended</segment5>
