		<segment1>It's not hard to know what you're thinking. When you look down on me now. Your trance of love is seeking. To turn this world around. But in my state of blind confusion. No God can pull me out. I see your love is willing. To turn me inside out </segment1>
		<segment2>And then I see you there. The lonely tears I cry. I wish they'd release me </segment2>
		<segment3>It's in despair that I find faith. Summon the night to bow down to day. When ignorance is bliss. Save me from myself </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: And then I see You there. With Your arms open wide and You try to embrace me. These lonely tears I cry. They keep me in chains and I wish they'd release me. Cold is the night but. Colder still is the heart made of stone, turned from clay. And if you follow me. You'll see all the black, all the white fade to grey </segment4>
		<segment5>Fade to grey. Fade to grey </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus x 2].     </segment6>
