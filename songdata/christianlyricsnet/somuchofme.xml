		<segment1>At the foot of the ocean. I'm hearing winds whisper and waves shout. The storm of the morning is clearing, the tide is running out. I'm feeling obviously small. A little of this sand is all I am. A bit of dust blown from Your hand You made the wind, You made the sea. Why do You make so much of me?</segment1>
		<segment2>You made the stars and every creature that breathes. Why do You make so much of me?. In the heart of the evening I'm counting the stars set in the sky. Getting lost at a hundred or fifty or so I'm thinking. I can only hide in some hole I carve in the earth. What am I worth? I'm just a speck, a candle in Your universe. And here I stand A bit of dust from Your big hand. What am I worth? A candle in Your universe.    </segment2>
