		<segment4>A voice cries out in the wilderness. In a dry and desolate land. A voice of one is calling. Destruction is at hand. This is a land where no one travels. A land where no one lives. But a light shines in the desert. In the place where Darkness is. She will become the least of nations. A wilderness, a dry land. But the wilderness will rejoice. Strengthen the feeble hands!. Steady the knees that give way. Be strong and do not fear. The voice calling American Culture. Is a voice that all can hear    </segment4>
