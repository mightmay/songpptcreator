		<segment1>One had vision. One came bringing it's doom. One saw napalm. One heard the man in the moon. We were children of promise. We were heirs to their dreams</segment1>
		<segment2>Tell me, why then is the hand slow. And the dog bites, well, I don't know. But the sky will fall. And heads will roll. And it's all that we can do. To wait for the healing</segment2>
		<segment3>Hungry hearted reason coming of age. Running headlong into the the latest rage. Always reaching within us. Claiming the answers are there</segment3>
		<segment4>Tell me, why then is the hand slow. And the dog bites, well, I don't know. But the sky will fall. And heads will roll. And it's all that we can do. To wait for the healing. For to carry on. For to stand when all is said and done. In the shadow of the rising sun. Longing, waiting for the healing</segment4>
		<segment5>We are children of promise. We are heirs to their dreams</segment5>
		<segment6>Tell me, why then is the hand slow. And the dog bites, well, I don't know. But the sky will fall. And heads will roll. And it's all that we can do. To wait for the healing. For to carry on. For to stand when all is said and done. In the shadow of the rising sun. Longing, waiting for the healing    </segment6>
