		<segment1>let's go.. we've come a long way. through the good and bad. and it's so much more than what it seems. sometimes i take it for granted. i take it for granted. which way will the wind blow?. i don't know if you will ever know how much this means to me. let me take this opportunity to say thank you for what you've given to me. there's no telling how long things will ever last. let's not forget the memories. the memories of our past    </segment1>
