		<segment1>I meant a lot in a word that I said. And I thought a lot, that word said alot. But then I ruined it, I left it out in the cold. I lost a lot because I thought a lot</segment1>
		<segment2>Life doesnt always demand that we understand, Just enjoy it</segment2>
		<segment3>Im starting to see it now. What it is we began, the few that we became, the person you became. And you mean a lot, so much for words to say. You mean a lot to me. You do.</segment3>
		<segment4>Life doesnt always demand that we understand, That we clap our hands, But we understand that its beautiful. Today has its way of making some things new, And maybe, that means me and you. So today what Ive seen changed a part of me. When it showed me a part of you.</segment4>
		<segment5>Im starting to see it now. What it is we began, the few that we became, the person you became.    </segment5>
