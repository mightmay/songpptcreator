		<segment1>Verse 1: When will the world. See that we need Jesus?. If we open our eyes. We will all realize. That He loves us. When will the world. See that we need Jesus?. When our hearts are as one. And believe that He's the Son of our God</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). The Lord is our God. And we shall never want. The Lord is our God. And we shall live forever. When we share the love of Jesus. See each other as He sees us. Then His love will see us through. His love will see us through</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: When will the world. See that we need Jesus?. When sister and brother. Love one another as one. When will the world. See that we need Jesus?. Will we ever understand. Jesus is the Son of man?. We must live in the shadow of His love</segment3>
