		<segment1>Blaze the night with the stick. Cuz your world is broken. Every face on the floor. When ever the word is spoken. Lonely beg all the way. Fallin asleep your hoping. Fate will come through the door. Open up cuz theres still time</segment1>
		<segment2>If you close your eyes. If ya took a breath. When your life is on the ground. If you feel away's. When its in this place. Then your life it will be found</segment2>
		<segment3>You will fall to your knees. Its a tragic sickness. Just a step to a break. Walk to the other side. You are sick when ya breathe. Cuz the remedy says. You will never ve safe. Open up cuz theres still time</segment3>
		<segment4>If you close your eyes. If ya took a breath. When your life is on the ground. If you feel away's. When its in this place. Then your life it will be found</segment4>
		<segment5>Lights fall. Its clear. Your words. Are here</segment5>
		<segment6>If you close your eyes. If ya took a breath. When your life is on the ground. If you fell away's. When its in this place. Then your life it will be found</segment6>
		<segment7>Motions started, breathing morning (If you close your eyes). Motions started, breathing morning (If you close your eyes). Motions started, breathing morning (If you close your eyes). Motions started, breathing morning (If you close your eyes)</segment7>
		<segment8>Open Up. Open Up. Open Up cuz theres still time. Open up cuz theres still time</segment8>
		<segment9>*&lt;em&gt;These lyrics may be incorrect and will be updated when the album is released&lt;/em&gt;*    </segment9>
