		<segment1>I am caught in the middle of. So much that I cannot see the forest for the trees. And oh I feel the pressure now. And Im about to blow, its all caving in on me</segment1>
		<segment2>Something I know is amiss in my soul. My eyes are on me. They should not be. Ill praise You from the center of the fire</segment2>
		<segment3>So I say. Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You. Ive got two words for You. Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You. From my heart. Thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You, thank You. Ive got three words more than thank You. I love You</segment3>
		<segment4>Ive got much to thank You for. You opened up the door. Turned my sorrow to joy. In this world that I am in. Your wonders never end. You define hope. Thinking of all that You have in store for me. I am in awe, I have got to stop. And thank You for the love I have found in You</segment4>
		<segment5>I want to say thank You for the peace. That I have found with Your love surrounding me. I want to say thank You for the mercy. Youve shown me the way that Youve grown me. I want to say thank You for the bride. That You gave and all of our babies. I want to say thank You just for being You. Cause You are the mystery that put a fix on me. I am just some dude with a checkered little history. Deep in the eye of my hurricane. But You are the blood pumping through my veins</segment5>
