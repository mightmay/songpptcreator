		<segment1>Tell me something I don't already know. I know that you can't stand these things I'm preaching in the streets. But how can I contain the truth I hold inside. With all the hurting people that I see so I don't mind. Putting up with you, and all the things you say. I'm not about to stop or even change my ways </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. There's nothing you can say. That will take me away from this life. There's nothing you can do. To shut me up when I'm speaking the truth </segment2>
		<segment3>Into the bridge and ending last line: (to shut me up, to shut me out when I'm speaking the truth) </segment3>
		<segment4>You may not like all I have to say. But you can't prove that everything is filled with empty words. I know my life and inside how I've changed. A testimony to the truth I speak, so I don't mind. Putting up with you, and all the things you say. I'm not about to stop or even change my ways.     </segment4>
