		<segment1>It tears me apart inside I know. Think twice it tears me apart inside I know. I do it too you can run but you can't hide. Deep down I find you so it seems it's no big deal. We don't think about it much a pain created a. Pain that's real I've got the scars to prove it. When we tear each other down what's our. Intentions? it's always more that just a joke. So let's try to think twice-so think twice! it's. True we are a brotherhood and we all know it. Bonded by the son of God is how we live-so think twice!.     </segment1>
