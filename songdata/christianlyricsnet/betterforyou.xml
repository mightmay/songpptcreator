		<segment1>My decision can not be put off again. I see the right choice but my heart is filled with dread. It all seems backwards in my head, my head</segment1>
		<segment2>I know it seems too wrong to be right. This way is so much harder to fight. But in the end I know it is true. This way is better, it's better for you</segment2>
		<segment3>Choose a little pain and gain a life with joy. Accepting pleasure now will earn a life of pain. It all seems backwards in my head, my head</segment3>
		<segment4>I know it seems too wrong to be right. This way is so much harder to fight. But in the end I know it is true. This way is better. It's better for you, for you</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes I wonder why it's this way. When it's done the burden is gone. This discomfort will be taken away. As soon as it's over, it's over for me</segment5>
		<segment6>I know it seems too wrong to be right. This way is so much harder to fight. But in the end I know it is true. This way is better. It's better for you, for you    </segment6>
