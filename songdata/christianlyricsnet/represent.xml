		<segment1>I've walked this road a thousand times before. and never found what I was looking for. All the time I stumble and I fall. Still here I stand trying to be free. Yes I try to get on with my life, taking one step at a time. I still can't fly. I try so hard to please, but never compromise. It took you to make me realize that I'm not by myself. I want you to be in my life. Cause I know you'll never say goodbye. For you I'd walk a thousand miles. I still can't fly.     </segment1>
