		<segment1>ayyyyy ohhhhh. we doing the tweezy dance </segment1>
		<segment2>so every time right now that you thinking of us. I gotta dance thats kind of smooth like some cocoa butters. its gonna be even bigger than jonas brothers. I wont stop till my face is on some pillow covers. Im a leave ya suckas now up straight shook. cause all you other little dances got ya lame hooks. and while you fronting right there w/ yo hard looks. im in a snuggie rocking out down to garth brooks. every single time that you try to rock. you looking awkward kind of like ya Michael Scott. in the office come off this its time to stop. I got a dance you can rock right upon ya block. just take ya hands man then ya swing em round. just like a fish out the water laying on the ground. just be careful right when ya swing em now. you swing the wrong way youre friend you gonna lay him out </segment2>
		<segment3>rock it in ya car even if they kind of laugh. pull up to the light and you can watch em start starting back. but watch ya arm man when you might swing it fast. and swing all around and just smack it on the dash. this is the dance for those who dont know how to act. you do it right every time that youre looking wack. but watch ya dad he might throw out his back. but watch ya grandma in the car she might kind of crash. now put ya fingers down inside ya palm. swing em around w/ ya miley cyrus tshirt on. act the very opposite of remaining calm. and just do it till youre screamed at by ya mom. tell them people they cant get w/ this. and let em know that youre fresher than some breath mints. you look like carlton from the fresh prince. thats the tweezy dance man what you guess kid    </segment3>
