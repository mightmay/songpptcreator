		<segment1>A new day was beginning. And all the birds were singing. The sun was shining up in the sky. Sometimes the world around me. Is so awesome it astounds me. It leaves me feeling mystified</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh I just can't believe. All the beauty I see. It takes my breath away. Sometimes I've gotta say</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. You're my God. What You've created. So many miracles in every day. You're my God. It's so amazing. It's so incredible I've gotta say. You're my God</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't even imagine. How He made it happen. To see the silver moon from afar. It's almost unbelievable. It's truly inconceivable. To think of all the billions of stars</segment4>
		<segment5>When I'm watching a rose. How it naturally grows. Just takes my breath away. There's just one thing to say</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh all the gifts You've given me. Oh what You do's a mystery, just to be, You got me falling to my knees. Oh I just can't believe</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS    </segment8>
