		<segment1>a simple song about anything but what I would normally sing about. all smiles and a catchy tune. and pretty soon I'll forget I'm here. I know these things work out. you're weeping, I'm keeping these secrets all to myself. no need to start up a fight. if that's all right, I'll remain silent. I know these things work out. you were under water. walking on the ocean floor. so far from shore. cold and uninviting were the waves. I lost my nerve. it's what I deserve. I know these things work out.     </segment1>
