		<segment1>I knew you were the one. My heart was overcome. The day I looked into your eyes. The feeling so surreal. Like time was standing still. When you said you would be mine</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, you are a miracle. Youre sweeter than Ive ever dreamed. Youre so much more than beautiful. How can it be that you belong to me</segment2>
		<segment3>So walk with me a while. And we will spend our lives. Learning the mysteries of love. And through the darkest nights. Well hold each other tight. I promise that will be enough</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh girl, you are more than beautiful. How can this be, that you belong to me. Oh, you belong to me. I love you, I love you, I love you. Girl, I love you. Oh, you are, youre more than beautiful. How can this be, that you belong to me    </segment4>
