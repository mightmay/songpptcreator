		<segment1>When youre down and youre falling fast, And you feel like your hope wont last. You know that Ill be your miracle. When you find that your faith is gone. Youre not sure if you can carry on. You know that Ill be your miracle. Youve been through more than anyone should. Can you find the good in such bad situation?. You never thought this could happen to you. Now you know the truth. You feel like your life is fading I hope you can remember. The life you had is going to change. But please dont be afraid it might be for the better. Ill be the one thats standing next to you. Ill be the one thats gonna help you make it through. When everybody else has gone. Ill be the one thats holing you    </segment1>
