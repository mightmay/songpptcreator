		<segment1>Im a fugitive. Running from the life that I was meant to live. Looking for somewhere that I can lay my head. Im lucky if I make it through the night. But I cant sleep. Knowing that Youre one more step ahead of me. Im a fool for ever thinking Youd just let me go. Thats not the way its ever gone before. Im Yours</segment1>
		<segment2>You catch me like a thief in the night. You hold me when I put up a fight. You chase me when I run from Your light. Because You love, You wont give up. Til my heart is stolen. Til my heart is stolen away</segment2>
		<segment3>Im trying to understand that life comes after dying. To embrace that Im a slave until Im captured. But You would never use a lock or a key. Cause I am free</segment3>
		<segment4>I could change my name, cover all my tracks. But Im wrong to think I could lose the past. Cause You found me here and You took me back. Once a criminal, now a prodigal    </segment4>
