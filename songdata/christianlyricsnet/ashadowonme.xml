		<segment1>These petals. This blackened rose in a soil all my own. Shrouding your hallowed ground. Like seeds who'll never sow. Like forgery and larceny and my ill-gained revelry. I recite these scripted lines while embers of a different time.. Go drifting by</segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-Chorus]. When every word you ever said came true. All I missed in all of this was you</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Can you see a shadow on me?. Calling me to leave. Find in me a trace of you in all this tragedy. You're the only home I know</segment3>
		<segment4>These pieces. The shattered shard dancing in the moonlight. Glimmering and glistening. Preparing me for the night. I never learned to walk the surface on my own. So lately, this ocean floor has been feeling more like home</segment4>
		<segment5>[Bridge]. So take me in these fleeting moments of solitude in you. Remove this sordid fascination with shadow. And remove this shattered self of preservation. All that you forgave and give all you promised to..</segment5>
		<segment6>[Outro]. Can you see this shadow lifting?. Drifting home again    </segment6>
