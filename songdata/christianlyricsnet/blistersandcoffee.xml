		<segment1>A showdown at dusk, This old town is lost, I'm flat on my back. And I can't see through the dust. </segment1>
		<segment2>But you never told me that I was worthy, You didn't let me live just to hurt me. </segment2>
		<segment3>Desperate. We will lift up our hands. Stronger. We will rise up against. Freedom. Is a part of us all. Its time to let it go. Desperate. We will lift up our hands. Stronger. We will rise up against. Freedom. Is a part of us all. Its time to let it go. </segment3>
		<segment4>What happens now when I walk out of town?. And the enemy surrounds me bent on hunting me down?. I'll be moving silent while the enemy sleeps, I'll show no mercy like the first time when they came after me. </segment4>
		<segment5>You'll never catch me. You'll never own me. Out on this lonely landscape I am free </segment5>
		<segment6>Desperate. We will lift up our hands. Stronger. We will rise up against. Freedom. It's a part of us all. It's time to let it go. Desperate. We will lift up our hands. Stronger. We will rise up against. Freedom. It's a part of us all. It's time to let it go. </segment6>
		<segment7>I guess we figured it out. One by one we're picking them off. I guess we figured it out. One by one we're picking them off. I guess we figured it out. One by one we're picking them off. </segment7>
		<segment8>Desperate. We will lift up our hands. Stronger. We will rise up against. Freedom. It's a part of us all. It's time to let it go. Desperate. We will lift up our hands. Stronger. We will rise up against. Freedom. It's a part of us all. It's time to let it go.    </segment8>
