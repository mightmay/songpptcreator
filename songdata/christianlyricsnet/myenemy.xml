		<segment1>Used to be the smiter came. Struck my cheek and I cursed his name. Used to be my fist was drawn. My heart was stone and its mercy gone. I was wrong to breath. Any words but these</segment1>
		<segment2>Peace and mercy. Invade every soul that hurts me, I pray. Peace and mercy. Invade every soul that hurts me. Love my enemy. Love my enemy. Like you loved me</segment2>
		<segment3>Used to be I rolled the dice. Held the spear and I broke your side. Water, blood and mercy ran. Turning foes to forgiven friends. I'd be wrong to give. Any less than this</segment3>
		<segment4>Peace and mercy. Invade every soul that hurts me, I pray. Peace and mercy. Invade every soul that hurts me. Love my enemy. Change my enemy. Forgive my enemy. Love my enemy. Like you loved me     </segment4>
