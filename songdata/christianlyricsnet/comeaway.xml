		<segment1>You don't have to stay there. You don't have to live like that. So don't just lay there. Take my hand, take my hand. You don't have to fake it. The things they've done are not okay. So don't just lay there. Take my hand, take it. Come away, come away</segment1>
		<segment2>chorus. Step outside and say goodbye. To your dark rooms of shame. Take my lead and you will find. Yourself smiling wide</segment2>
		<segment3>Why give your love. To those who are using you. Why be afraid. Take my hand, take my hand. And don't buy their lies. That keep you hiding from me. Cause you can make it. Take my hand, take it. Come away, come away    </segment3>
