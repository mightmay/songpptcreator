		<segment1>Did you feel the mountains tremble?. Did you hear the oceans roar?. When the people rose to sing of. Jesus Christ the risen one</segment1>
		<segment2>Did you feel the people tremble?. Did you hear the singers roar?. When the lost began to sing of. Jesus Christ the risen one</segment2>
		<segment3>And we can see that God you're moving. A mighty river through the nations. And young and old will turn to Jesus. Fling wide your heavenly gates. Prepare the way of the risen Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>Open up the doors and let the music play. Let the streets resound with singing. Songs that bring your hope. Songs that bring your peace. Dancers who dance upon injustice</segment4>
		<segment5>Did you feel the darkness tremble?. When all the saints join in one song. And all the streams flow as one river. To wash away our brokeness</segment5>
		<segment6>And here we see that God you're moving. A time of Jubilee is coming. When young and old return to Jesus. Fling wide your heavenly gates. Prepare the way of the risen Lord.     </segment6>
