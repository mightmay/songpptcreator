		<segment1>I waited for you today. But you didn't show. No no no. I needed You today. So where did You go?. You told me to call. Said You'd be there. And though I haven't seen You. Are You still there?</segment1>
		<segment2>I cried out with no reply. And I can't feel You by my side. So I'll hold tight to what I know. You're here and I&quot;m never alone</segment2>
		<segment3>And though I cannot see You. And I can't explain why. Such a deep, deep reassurance. You've placed in my life</segment3>
		<segment4>We cannot separate. 'Cause You're part of me. And though You're invisible. I'll trust the unseen    </segment4>
