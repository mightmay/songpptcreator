		<segment1>I cherish the treasure. The treasure of you. Lifelong companion. I give myself to you. God has enabled me. To walk with you faithfully. And cherish the treasure. The treasure of you</segment1>
		<segment2>As I obey the Spirit's voice. And seek to do His will. I then can see the wisdom of His plan. For as He works His will in me. I then can love you selflessly. And by His grace, can pledge my love. To you</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>This sacred vow I make to you. Does not contain an &quot;if&quot;. Though I'm aware that trials lie ahead. I will love you and pray with you. And through it all, I will stay with you. Our home will be a refuge of. Unconditional love</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Cherish the treasure. The treasure of you    </segment6>
