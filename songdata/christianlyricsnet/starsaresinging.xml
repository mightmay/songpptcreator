		<segment1>Under open skies I leave the day behind. Wonder in my eyes, the world feels so alive. I just speak Your name and my heart seems to change. God of truth and grace, I can only praise You.</segment1>
		<segment2>And the stars are singing out. the glory of Your wonderous love. Heaven's reaching down. to show me all that you have done for me</segment2>
		<segment3>Healer of my heart, come burn away the dark. Under soft twilight, I can hear your voice tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>Your name is higher than the Heavens. Your glory fills a million skies. Your heart is reaching down from heaven. and my soul cries out to you    </segment4>
