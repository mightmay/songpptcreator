		<segment1>As part of Your design, I leave myself far behind. I turn my eyes to You, and I raise my hands up to the sky. Father is calling, every single heart that's beating. Run to salvation, let the world around you fade away</segment1>
		<segment2>Yesterday, today, forever, all may change but You will never, Glory to Your name, glory to Your name</segment2>
		<segment3>Part of Your master plan, I commit my spirit to Your hands. Though a storm may come for me, I will rest underneath Your wings. Father is calling, every single heart that's beating. Run to salvation, let the world around you fade away</segment3>
		<segment4>Yesterday, today, forever, all may change but You will never, Glory to Your name, glory to Your name. All that is within me longs to touch Your heart with this love song, glory to Your name, Glory to Your name</segment4>
		<segment5>Take me back to where I first believed. Let me go back to the place, where I fell in love when I saw Your face for the first time..yeah    </segment5>
