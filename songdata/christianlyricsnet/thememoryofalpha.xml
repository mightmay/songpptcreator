		<segment1>Thought I saw a specter in the tree. Be careful if you slumber. Was walking in the garden, heard you leave. Soon we'll need to be covered. I arrived, as the light was lifted from your eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>Memory, memory, memory, memory. Memory, memory, memory, memory. Memory of alpha</segment2>
		<segment3>Are you bleeding?. Oh, it's just a stain. I thought I heard you speaking. Trembling as you inch towards my embrace. What is it that you're holding?. You replied, before the innocence had left my eyes    </segment3>
