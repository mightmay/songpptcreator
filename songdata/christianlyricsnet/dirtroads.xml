		<segment1>country dirt roads. this walk is not the same without you. right here &quot; by me &quot; the twig I trip over is you. over &quot; this bridge &quot; the memories of the past times. look up &quot; past the trees &quot; and to the left. the broken house that you lived in </segment1>
		<segment2>good times was all we had. concrete slabs spray painted. leaves me pictures of you. I patiently wait (the place we played) for you. I silently pray(you'll find a way) for you </segment2>
		<segment3>the top &quot; of this tree &quot; where we could see for miles. stories &quot; of the times &quot; the testimonies of our lives. smell the air &quot; take a breath &quot; fall asleep and listen in. we learn a lot from experiences, but it's no good  if we don't change. good times was all we had &quot; concrete slabs spray painted. leaves me pictures of you - I patiently wait for you. I silently pray for you</segment3>
		<segment4>close your eyes (It's time to move on to the new.). hold on tight (forget the past, forget old you'.). we'll be alright (look to the new pasture.). close your eyes (the past won't meet your future.) </segment4>
		<segment5>the field &quot; the creek -  where the fort we built I think still lay. crooked branches with our names - still engraved. they'll stay the same.    </segment5>
