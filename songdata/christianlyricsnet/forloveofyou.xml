		<segment1>You live in a million places. Your fingerprints can be seen on a million faces. and there's a trace of You. in every alleluia. every song that I sing</segment1>
		<segment2>for love of You. I'm a sky on fire. for love of You. i come alive. it's Your Sacred Heart within me beating. Your voice within me singing. (out for love of You)</segment2>
		<segment3>it's all for you</segment3>
		<segment4>You are the highway i travel. cause i watched You carve streets of gold. from sin and gravel. i gave You brokenness. You gave me innocence. and now this road leads to glory</segment4>
		<segment5>You are my deepest longing. so i see You everywhere. it's You I'm chasing after. cause i am captivated by who You are. and how You move. I'll follow You forever. God. for love of You    </segment5>
