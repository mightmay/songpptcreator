		<segment1>Do you think that a California girl is supposed to have curls and wear a jean size 3?. All the curves in all the right places, spray tanned faces just like on TV?. And we read in the gospel of Vogue that we're all suppose to dress and move and be. Visions of perfection. Such a misconception. 'Cause the real connection is deeper than the eye can see </segment1>
		<segment2>What's inside of you. What's inside of me. The hands that made the moon and stars. The mountains and the seas. Made you wonderful, beautiful, marvelously. Let the whole world see your. True beauty </segment2>
		<segment3>Don't know much about Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Seems like a lot of drama to me. And you can keep all your red high heels. And open-toed shoes - I'm good in my bare feet. Let's gown to the nitty gritty. Enough sex and the city. What about purity?. Skin is just the surface. The passion and the purpose that's burning down inside us. Is really what we need to see </segment3>
		<segment4>Doesn't come in a bottle, doesn't come in a box. You can't spray it on, you can't wash it off. You can't nip and tuck, you can't sew it up. So don't waste your time. It's the love in your heart, the peace in your soul. The hope in your smile lets the whole world know. This little light - you gotta let it shine    </segment4>
