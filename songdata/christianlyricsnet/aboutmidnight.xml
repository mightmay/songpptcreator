		<segment1>At about midnight I'll call. At about midnight I'll call out your name. I need you beside me. Through these seasons of change</segment1>
		<segment2>At about midnight. Awaiting the dawn. I'll find contentment. Singing your song</segment2>
		<segment3>Here in the valley. Shadows lead the way. Where the past meets today. Where the past meets today</segment3>
		<segment4>Seasons come and they go. Seasons come and they go like the night. Because you are with me. Things will turn out alright </segment4>
		<segment5>At about midnight. Awaiting the dawn. I'll find contentment. Singing your song</segment5>
		<segment6>Here in the valley. Shadows lead the way. Yes I know that you're with me now</segment6>
		<segment7>I don't understand this path I'm on. Like I'm looking down at the sun. All turned around again. All turned around again</segment7>
		<segment8>At about midnight. Awaiting the dawn. I'll find contentment. Singing your song</segment8>
		<segment9>Here in the valley. Shadows lead the way. Where the past meets today. Where the past meets today. Where the past meets today. Where the past meets today</segment9>
		<segment10>So at about midnight I'll call. At about midnight I'll call out your name     </segment10>
