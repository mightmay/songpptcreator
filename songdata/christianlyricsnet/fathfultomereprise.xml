		<segment1>All the chisels I've dulled carving idols of stone. that have crumbled like sand 'neath the waves. I've recklessly built all my dreams in the sand, just to watch them all wash away</segment1>
		<segment2>Through another day, another trial. Another chance to reconcile. To One who sees past all I've seen, and reaching out my weary hand, I pray that you'd understand, You're the only one who's faithful to me.</segment2>
		<segment3>All the pennies I've wasted in my wishing well. I have thrown like stones to the sea. I have cast my lots, dropped my guard, searched aimlessly, for a faith to be faithful to me.</segment3>
		<segment4>Through another day, another trial, Another chance to reconcile. To One who sees past all I've seen, and reaching out my weary hand, I pray that you'd understand, You're the only one who's faithful to me. You're the only one who's faithful to me.     </segment4>
