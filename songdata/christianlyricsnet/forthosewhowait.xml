		<segment1>This is for those who wait</segment1>
		<segment2>Another day another waiting game. A little different but its still the same. I am here but wheres the One Im longing for. Im having troubles feeling all alone. When my heart find a home. I want to hope but sometimes I just dont know. I know Im not the only one</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). So you sing a lullaby. To the lonely hearts tonight. Let it set Your heart on fire. Let it set You free. When youre fighting to believe in a love that you cant see. Just know there is a purpose. For those who wait</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to open up my eyes. I know that Im in need is time. Im growing stronger every single day. God, Im gonna lead them to You now. Letting go all of my fear and doubt. I cant do this on my own so Ill give You control. I know Im not the only one</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus). So you sing a lullaby. To the lonely hearts tonight. Let it set Your heart on fire. Let it set You free. When youre fighting to believe in a love that you cant see. Just know there is a purpose. For those who wait</segment5>
		<segment6>The pressure makes us stronger. The struggle makes us hunger. The hard lessons make the difference. The pressure makes us stronger. The struggle makes us hunger. The hard lessons make the difference. And the difference makes it worth it. (Chrous). So you sing a lullaby. To the lonely hearts tonight. Let it set Your heart on fire. Let it set You free. When youre fighting to believe in a love that you cant see. Just know there is a purpose. For those who wait</segment6>
		<segment7>Set your heart on fire. This is for those who wait    </segment7>
