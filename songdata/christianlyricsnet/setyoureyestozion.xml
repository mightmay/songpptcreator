		<segment1>Back in the day when man he paved the way. Fell in temptation, sin spread through the nation. Lead me salvation, and pierce the palms of holy hands. Who is the son of man? Take me to the promised land. Where I and I free, Jah set my mind at ease. I stay cool in the shade even at 96?. You must believe and plant this seeds of wisdom. Stick to the track and don't be trapped by Babylon. Set your eyes to Zion. Jah Jah people ride on</segment1>
		<segment2>Forgive them Lord, for they not know. That what they do, people blame it on you. Can't understand why dem so mad. Dem heart get cold, empty with no soul. I've begun to search for One. Giver of life, I and I recognize. To be with you, forever I'll be with you. In paradise, Zion I set my eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>Set your eyes to Zion. Jah Jah people ride on</segment3>
		<segment4>Tell me Mr. Deadman?. Do you have the answer?. How do you get to heaven?. Do you have the answer?. Hey Mr. Deadman. I'll tell you if you want to know. How you can get to heaven?. Believe in I Jah Jah son</segment4>
		<segment5>Set your eyes to Zion. Jah Jah people ride on.     </segment5>
