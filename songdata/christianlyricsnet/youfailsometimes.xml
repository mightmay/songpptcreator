		<segment1>To see that you fail sometimes. It's the only thing to be. And the truth will unwind. And fall on your tongue </segment1>
		<segment2>You feel that your gonna be opened up. You think that your gonna see through you heart. You try not to fall on your face. Now is the time to open up</segment2>
		<segment3>It's good to know that you fail sometimes. You try to see but your right off line </segment3>
		<segment4>In time I will see that your way. Is the only way to be. It will fall on my mind. That there must be something real. There must be something real</segment4>
		<segment5>In time I will see. There must be something real.     </segment5>
