		<segment1>Ive got a lot goin on inside, Dont know if I can work things out this time, I need a little space to clear my mind, But Ill be fine. Dont slip, its not always this cold, Im tired of acting like I know, Am I searching for the answers, No one knows?. And I must confess, Before I take another step that</segment1>
		<segment2>This songs for everyone like me, Everyone not afraid to stand alone and lonely. Can you identify with me?. This songs for everyone like you, Come and ride with me, We will not back down.</segment2>
		<segment3>Wait, it might not be too late, To avoid the tension we create, How about I turn and walk away?. No matter what you say, Its not a combination, Ive tried to figure you out, Im lookin for a confirmation, So I can turn this around. And I must confess, Before I take another step that</segment3>
		<segment4>Every time I turn around, Youre looking for attention, Youve taken all the things Ive said, And thrown them away, Drank them away, And every time you show up late, Youre looking for forgiveness. I must confess, Before I take another step that</segment4>
		<segment5>This songs for anyone who ever took a chance, Who started out at the bottom to get to the top, And no matter what you face in this life. You gotta know what youre up against, In order to fight back.</segment5>
		<segment6>This songs for everyone like me, Everyone not afraid to stand alone and lonely. Can you identify with me?. This songs for everyone like you, Come and ride with me, We will not back down.</segment6>
		<segment7>This songs for everyone like me, Everyone not afraid to stand alone and lonely, and lonely    </segment7>
