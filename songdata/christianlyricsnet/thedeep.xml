		<segment1>you'll be a wolf devoured by a lion. cause you look like a lamb. but baptized in fire. fearing yet hoping the best. has swallowed you asleep once again</segment1>
		<segment2>I should go to sleep. I fear I'm running out of time. (waits for no one)</segment2>
		<segment3>sometimes I feel I should. sever my limbs. so I could never crawl home. back home to you. waiting and watching to see. if you'll follow me to my grave</segment3>
		<segment4>I might not wake up next to you. excuses, excuses, excuses, excuses. make excuses for eating your young. let's lick the wounds. and find out where we came from. when copperas has faded. I hope you'll still be by my side. this is not dystrophy but desire. desire for comfort in the dark. call me a mocking bird and it's done    </segment4>
