		<segment1>It eats at you I know, but it's so hard to let it go. Let yourself go yah just let yourself go. It consumes you can't you see that sin hates everybody. Everybody, sin hates everybody. Even though I know the reasons why, it breaks me down I want to cry. I search for comfort in a friend, when will my troubles ever end?. The sugarcoated poisoned apple. Tastes so good that you can't see. The death and decay that's inside. And what it's done to me. The sugarcoated poisoned apple. Tastes do good how could you know. Its deciteful lies. And where you're gonna go.     </segment1>
