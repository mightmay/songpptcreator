		<segment1>I'm hard to understand when you don't know me. But can we still be friends. It's better off that way. Through my eyes I'll see you there. It's hard to understand. When no one ever seems to care</segment1>
		<segment2>With my words I'll make a change. And try to rearrange</segment2>
		<segment3>And walls of fear come crashing down. I won't look back don't turn around. And with my life I'll make a change. And hope we'll all be friend again</segment3>
		<segment4>It's hard to make amends. I know it isn't easy but try and understand. It's really not that bad    </segment4>
