		<segment1>And she brought forth her firstborn son; and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, because there was no room for them in the inn. Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. And behold an angle of the Lord stood before them and the Glory of the Lord shone around them and they were greatly afraid. Then the angle said to them, do not be afraid for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a savior who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angle a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, &quot;Glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace, goodwill toward men.&quot;.     </segment1>
