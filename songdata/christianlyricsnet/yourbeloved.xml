		<segment1>Lord it was you. You created the heavens. Lord it was your hands. That put the stars in their place. Lord it was your voice. That commands the morning. Cause even oceans and their waves bow at your feet. Oh God</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Lord who am I. Compared to your glory. Lord who am I. Compared to your majesty</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause I'm your beloved. Your creation. And you love me as I am. You call me chosen. For your kingdom. Unashamed to call me your own. Cause I'm your beloved</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord it was you. You created the heavens. Lord it was your hands. That put the stars in their place. Lord it was your voice. That commands the morning. Cause even oceans and their waves bow at your feet. Oh God</segment4>
