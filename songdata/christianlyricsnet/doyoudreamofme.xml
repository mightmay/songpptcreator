		<segment1>Dreams within the still of night. On wings of hope take flight inside of me. There upon some distant shore. We want for nothing more than what will be. And you and I, here we are. I wonder as we come this far</segment1>
		<segment2>If I could only read your mind. Tell me the answer I would find. Do you dream of me?</segment2>
		<segment3>Love has found a magic space. A deep and hidden place where time stands still. Now I hold you in my arms. You know you hold my heart and always will. And you and I, here we are. And it's a wonder that we've come this far</segment3>
		<segment4>And after all that we've been through. You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you. Do you dream of me?. And when you're smiling in your sleep. Beyond the promises we keep. Do you dream of me?</segment4>
		<segment5>If I could only read your mind. Tell me the answer I would find. Do you dream of me?. And when you're smiling in your sleep. Beyond the promises we keep. Do you dream of me?. And after all that we've been through. You've leaned on me, I've leaned on you. Do you dream of me?. Do you dream of me?    </segment5>
