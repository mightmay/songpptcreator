		<segment1>Fast lane, sane, insane this world is running. And I'm walking with a cane. Seek, seek you can be unique. But whatever you do don't let your inside out. But I've got to take a leak </segment1>
		<segment2>And I know You're alive. And you know I will always try. I could never care less about. What this world has to offer if the price is to die. I'll keep my human spirit alive </segment2>
		<segment3>Man I'm so weak. Come on over here I'll let you have a peek. Inside my heart cause you're the one I seek. I know I'm slow but wherever I go. I hear your steps echo </segment3>
		<segment4>And I know You're alive. And I'll give my heart to survive. This world has nothing to offer a human soul. Reaching for the sky. So Father of light. Keep my human spirit alive </segment4>
		<segment5>Will I try to hide away in the secret space of my heart. Will I try in time. Will I try with my feet on the ground of shadows. But my hands towards the light. Will I try in time </segment5>
		<segment6>Your eyes. Are always there. Your eyes. Are what I came for </segment6>
		<segment7>Your eyes. Drive away my fear. Your eyes. I could just stand there and adore </segment7>
		<segment8>Stop just right there. Everything has to stop to steal time. For whom I want to be near. Yes I do care and I love the love we share </segment8>
		<segment9>And I know You're alive. I'll give my heart to survive. This world has nothing to offer a human soul. Reaching for the sky. So Father of light. Keep this human spirit alive </segment9>
		<segment10>Will I try.. </segment10>
		<segment11>Seems there is nothing to remind me of peace down here. So how come that all I feel is joy    </segment11>
