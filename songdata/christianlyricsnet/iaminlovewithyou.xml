		<segment1>You found me in the darkness. And you brought me light. You took my lifeless heart. And you gave me life. You cleansed me from my sin. And filled me up. With your spirit and with your love</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I'm laughing at the things. That once held me bound. I'm dancing in the freedom that I've found. 'Cause your love is better than life Lord. I long for you more. Than I ever did before</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: I can't get enough of you. 'Cause I am in love with you. O how I long for you. 'Cause I am in love with you</segment3>
		<segment4>So here I am in worhsip with open eyes. Now I want to live a blameless life. 'Cause I am finally living at last. You give me hope t leave my past. I will not keep silent. I will sing of the wonder of my God. His great love. And every day my heart is enlarged for you. So I will abandon myself to you</segment4>
		<segment5>(REPEAT CHORUS 2 TIMES)</segment5>
		<segment6>It burns like a blazing fire. It rises like a mighty flame. My greatest desire. To be sealed in love. By your name.     </segment6>
