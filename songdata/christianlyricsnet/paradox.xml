		<segment1>Bite your tongue until it bleeds. This pain is worth more than what you have to say. Swallow your pride because silence is golden, and I wouldn't pay a penny to hear your thoughts. Lie down your guard and surrender. All that you're proving is your ignorance. Lie down your guard and surrender. All that you're proving is your ignorance. Choose your words carefully. He that keeps his mouth keeps his life;. He that opens his lips too wide shall bring on his own destruction [Proverbs 13:3]. Bite your tongue until it bleeds. The pain is worth more than what you have to say. Swallow your pride. Swallow your pride because silence is golden, and I wouldn't pay a penny to hear your thoughts. Lie down your guard. Lie down your guard and surrender. [x6]    </segment1>
