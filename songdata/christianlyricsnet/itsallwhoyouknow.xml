		<segment1>For the want of a marker. the doctors lost their place. For the want of a cut-line. they couldn't lift his face. For the want of a facelift. his ratings dropped. Then the sitcom folded. then the network flopped </segment1>
		<segment2>after the climb. after time turns designs to despair. it is good. nothing's fair. it's all who you know </segment2>
		<segment3>For the want of a cough drop. the musher's throat went hoarse. For the want of direction. the huskies went off course. Then the sled got snowbound. it took some time to free `em. Now they're on display. inside the British Museum </segment3>
		<segment4>after the climb. after time turns designs to despair. it is good. nothing's fair. it's all who you know </segment4>
		<segment5>and after the fall. after all of our strivings are dust. even so. good for us. it's all who you know </segment5>
		<segment6>For the want of a compass. we'd be shuffling charts. For the want of good radar. we'd be glacier parts. For the want of a lighthouse. can't you see. we'd be lost at sea. lost at sea    </segment6>
