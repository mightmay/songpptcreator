		<segment1>V 1: It ain't nothin' but a good thang. What we've got goin' here. A little somethin' different to get your attention. A brand new dimension, to change your mind. 3 sisters who's roots are in the family. Without fantasy, only that the eye can see. A lot of love, and the bonds of unity. Open your heart to how it should be </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Hey everybody come along cause Gotee's Groovin'. Set your mind at ease cause we'll keep the people movin' </segment2>
		<segment3>V 2: Now that you know what we came to do. Just swing to this betta make you move. On tha Bandwagon that is coming soon, don't get left behind. Cause one day I'll fly away, to a place where the groove keeps on movin'. Take my hand, hold on tight, Just come along </segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE: Rainy days, your life's a haze. No time to play at all, cause all your troubles. Relax your mind, set your troubles behind. Heed the call of the one who knows all </segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS </segment5>
		<segment6>RAP: Come wit me follow Gotee goin places. Sweet molasses for the masses. Uplifting the races. Goulish is tha flow as the nitwit hits tha grit hit. While OOE stacks tha back up with the phat cup. Manuevering my intellect the groove just hoovers me. Then I check your person on certain subject and matters. The battle is bone the team is Gotee. Who can it be but Grits makin' hits with Out Of Eden </segment6>
