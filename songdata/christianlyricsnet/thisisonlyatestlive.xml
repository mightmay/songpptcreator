		<segment1>Sometimes they move faster. Faster than our eyes can tell the morning. Some ways for us to test. Each day we say our prayers for you. These are the days that we came home. hoping for the best. these are the days that we came home again. I have to say that I love you. I love you still. This lie is coming out. Breaking bonds that hold us. Throwing stones that hurt us. You cried, you tried to tell us what we wanted to hear. is it something that you fear?. these are the days that we came home. hoping for the best. these are the days that we came home again. I have to say. that I love you. I love you still. this is ever true. After all you said did you think it through?. did you think it through?    </segment1>
