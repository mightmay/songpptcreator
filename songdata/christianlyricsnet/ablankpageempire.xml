		<segment1>thoughts pass by like a river flow. must be hard to keep track. where you came from. I'd float down. stand right next to you. but something is causing a lull. in the traffic. an empire is moving the grass overgrown. I'd blow this whole world to pieces. to not be alone. this shovels been digging all day long. can't even seem to make a scratch. in the surface. but what is the purpose. I'll always be stopped by the why can't I. why can't I be you. and put those hands away. I go through this everyday. sounds like a radio tuned to white noise. softer slowly softer. can't this thing go any faster. and for everyone to see. it's only killing me. awake in this cold cell I. I just hope you're happy. awake in this cold cell. I break my body against the wall. awake in this cold cell. I am my only devil why can't I be you. and put those hands away. I go through this everyday. I am my only devil</segment1>
