		<segment1>How does it make you feel when i look away. Feelings that will never seem to fade i try to. Find you, you hold your head up high i let it all. Fall down do you hear me</segment1>
		<segment2>Falling away fromt his pain so i can fly high, Feeling low just let it show. And find the words to say what you mean</segment2>
		<segment3>Screaming silent fears, nothing left to say, lost. Inside the words that bring you donw you try to. Find me, i hold my head up high, you let it all fall. Down do you hear me</segment3>
		<segment4>Find the words to say how you feel inside. Find the words to say how you feel inside. Find the words to say    </segment4>
