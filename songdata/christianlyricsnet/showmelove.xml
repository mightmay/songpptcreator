		<segment1>Love is patient love is kind. You love me and you don't mind. When I'm not so perfect. You still patiently stand by</segment1>
		<segment2>My actions fail to show. But in spite of me you seem to know. That I only want to love you. Cause I can't make it on my own</segment2>
		<segment3>My words have cut you to the bone. But my heart still longs for you alone </segment3>
		<segment4>Show me love, show me life, give me time. Because I want to shine in spite of who I am. Sow me love, give me time. Because I want to shine in spite of who I am</segment4>
		<segment5>I know through you I am justified. But still I can't find the line. Where my works will match my faith. And I'll lay myself aside</segment5>
		<segment6>My actions fail to show. But in spite of me you seem to know. That I only want to love you. Cause I can't make it on my own</segment6>
		<segment7>When my mind denies the love I know. My life sends nails through your bone</segment7>
		<segment8>Bridge. I can't define Your love but I need it I need it yeah. I can't give enough of me but You want it so I'll give. I don't deserve Your love but I have it, I have it now    </segment8>
