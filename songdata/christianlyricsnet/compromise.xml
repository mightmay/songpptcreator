		<segment1>Why don't you come to me?. Why don't you realize?. My heart is break up. Where are you coming from?. Why did you compromise?. I don't believe in that. I could just let you fall, I could just let you drown. Why would you want to pull away?. Why would you want to lose that joy?. You know how your life has been before. You know that emptiness won't cease. I can't just let you fall, I can't just watch you drown. And I know you will see what He has planned. I know you will see what you have done. It's hard to see the path to take, but you know the truth.    </segment1>
