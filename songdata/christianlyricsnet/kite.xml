		<segment1>I hid myself from failure and fear. O my dear you're a threat to the bad in us all. They tell themselves that each word from your lips. Or the grace in your eyes overcomes any fall</segment1>
		<segment2>Over the twilight you're listening for me. Darling, go to sleep. Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be. Loved so deep</segment2>
		<segment3>Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string. Till you cut through my tether and changed everything. From the sky you looked small, but I loved you the same. So I darted back quickly to spell out your name. And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite. You'll tell them you're proud of my loveless flight</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't hide yourself inside till I'm old. O my dear you're a threat to the bad we all see. I'm beside myself for the touch of your lips. Or the grace of your eyes that can see good in me</segment4>
		<segment5>Over the twilight you're listening for me. Darling, go to sleep. Cradled by moonlight, I'm dreaming we'll be. Loved so deep</segment5>
		<segment6>Floating and fighting, like a kite on a string. Till you cut through my tether and changed everything. From the sky you looked small, but I loved you the same. So I darted back quickly to spell out your name. And when they say that I'm just a terrible kite. You'll tell them you're proud of my loveless flight.     </segment6>
