		<segment1>please don't go away. i nedd you, my friend, stay. in all these troubled times. you've brought me peace of mind. it breaks my heart. it breaks my heart to see you go. and in this darkened world. you've been my hidden pearl. and in the light of day. you put the sun to shame. it breaks my heart it breaks my heart to see you go. and i know that i have failed you. sometimes i feel like that's all i do. but let the fading day remind you. thats there's somebody thinking of you    </segment1>
