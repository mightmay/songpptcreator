		<segment1>Two hands on the wheel of my fate. Sweat running down my forehead. Cars passing me like we're in a race. I don't know what danger lies ahead</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause I'm just a student driver. And I need your help to guide me. Cause on my own I'm nothing</segment2>
		<segment3>Looks like the road ahead might be rough to take. Oh no, I've spun out of control. Good thing my passenger has a brake. And he knows exactly where to go</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause I'm just a student driver. And I need your help to guide me. Cause on my own I'm nothing</segment4>
		<segment5>Now my right wheel is wobbling off. And my stereo is blown. But because I'm a student driver. This car is not my own</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause I'm just a student driver. And I need your help to guide me. Cause on my own I'm nothing</segment6>
		<segment7>Cause I'm just a student driver. And I need your help to guide me. Cause on my own I'm nothing</segment7>
		<segment8>Cause I'm just a student driver. And I need your help to guide me. Cause on my own I'm nothing    </segment8>
