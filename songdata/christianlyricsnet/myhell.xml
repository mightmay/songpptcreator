		<segment1>It's not found in throwing roses on a grave. Or in the cursed bottom of a bottled plague. It wasn't in the torment that will never fade. But I see the truth now</segment1>
		<segment2>This was my hell living without You here. Even Heaven is hell if somehow You were not there. If You were not there</segment2>
		<segment3>It wasn't in the flames that won't stop burning. Or within a fire that is never quenched. It wasn't in the brokenness of all my failings. But I see the truth now</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, I need to breathe You. Drink You, dream You. Nothing ever will compare. Need to breathe You, drink You. Dream You, need You</segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
