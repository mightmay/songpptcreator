		<segment1>Though the hard times have its hold on me, I heap these upon myself. It leaves the beauty of grace not mistaken for anything at all. I can't deny the change in my life. I wouldn't ask for more. Nothing can take that away. I believe the blind will be healed and the slaved will be set free. Nothing can take that away. This makes me bound by what I've learned. Any drive I have hasn't come from but what's been done for me. This won't be made less than what it is. The gift of knowing you is pure joy. Some thing's change but this will stay the same. The gift of knowing you is pure joy    </segment1>
