		<segment1>(Verse 1). This is a love. Deep in the soul. O when you love. O when you love. The veil is torn. Mystery pours</segment1>
		<segment2>Down from above. Down from above</segment2>
		<segment3>(Pre-Chorus). And yet we are under benediction. So there is grace</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). Hallelujah, we rejoice. What a Savior. What a King. Hallelujah, lift your voice. To our Savior. To our King</segment4>
		<segment5>(Verse 2). O please do stay. Where you remain. Do not fall. Do not fall. Something greater. Is on the way. Just hang on. Try to hang on. Try to hang on</segment5>
		<segment6>(Bridge). The love of angels. Becomes a love anew. O heavenly light. Takes on a fair skin</segment6>
		<segment7>(Ending). What a Savior. What a King. (X12)</segment7>
