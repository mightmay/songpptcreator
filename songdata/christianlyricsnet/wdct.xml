'Cause we're bringing you the funk, the whole funk, and nothin' but the funk. dc Talk style, [oh yeah] day and night, night and day. And it's me the E, flippin' the wax. So kick back, relax all you little funkadelics. 'Cause the train's in the house. Kickin the mad styles for ya. So yo, next up is that little diddy. Off that funky, funky, funky little ablum, &quot;Free At Last&quot;. [It's about time!]. Word, ya know what I'm saying?. [.. Been tellin' me it's been comin' out for two years. Been waitin' on this record, man. It's about time you be flippin' instead of flakin']. Brother be flippin'.    </segment1>
