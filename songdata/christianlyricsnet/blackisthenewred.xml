		<segment1>here i am but where are you. i'm a jar and i am empty too. i forgot how to pray to you. buried my treasure in the ground. are you near is it far. can i get to where you are. without your strength within me. without your presence under my skin. with nothing at all. i want you inside. so why don't you come and find me. i'll be waiting right here. there's nothing left to say to you. there's nothing left for me to do. than raise my hands in awe to you. it's you i know that gets me through. it's out of my hands again. i fold myself up again    </segment1>
