		<segment1>And I love You. All of my hope is in You. Jesus Christ, take my life. Take all of me, yeah. All of me</segment1>
		<segment2>You broke the night like the sun. Healed my heart with Your great love. And any trouble I couldn't bear. You lifted me upon Your shoulders. Love that's stronger. Love that covers sin. And takes the weight of the world</segment2>
		<segment3>You stand on mountain tops with me. With You I walk through the valleys. You gave Your only Son for me. Your grace is all I rely on</segment3>
		<segment4>Love that's stronger. Love that covers sin. And takes the weight of the world</segment4>
		<segment5>And I love You so. And I give up my heart to say. I need You so. My everything, O Lord. I love You so.     </segment5>
