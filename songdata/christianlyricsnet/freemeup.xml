		<segment1>I'm giving up my electro TV things. 'Cuz I don't ever need, no anything like that again. I'm livin' on the move and. I wanna drop these chains. Well you'd be surprised what you can leave behind. It keeps me looking upward</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS</segment2>
		<segment3>You free me up to live this life far. from any Earthly sense of home. There's a place where I belong but. there's nothing here I really own. I really own</segment3>
		<segment4>Do you deem this to be extreme behavior?. A little bit too ideal. You call it young man's fever. But I've got my treasure stored beyond Heaven's gates. And you'd be surprised what lies behind them. It keeps me looking upward</segment4>
		<segment5>You free me up live this life far. from any Earthly sense of home. There's a place where I belong but. there's nothing here. But there's nothing here, there's nothing here. No there's nothing here I really own. I really own</segment5>
		<segment6>BRIDGE. All that you find here, you will lose it. All you find here, you will lose it. All you gain here on earth, you'll lose in the end. All you gain here on earth, you will lose it.. Lose it    </segment6>
