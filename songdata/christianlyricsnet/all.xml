		<segment1>you're the one who give shelter. and you're the light that leads me home. you're the love that gave forever.. Lord you're all that I know</segment1>
		<segment2>and all that I am..unto you I surrender... Lord there is none like you. and I know that I stand..in the arms of forever.. Lord there is none like you</segment2>
		<segment3>there is none like you</segment3>
		<segment4>with the world upon your shoulders... Lord you gave your life away. if the world I know was over... I know I'd have life in the price you paid</segment4>
		<segment5>and I will stand..and I will worship you forever.. for all you are. and I will stand.. and all to you I will surrender.. I'll worship you forever    </segment5>
