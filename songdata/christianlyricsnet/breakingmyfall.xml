		<segment1>So easily I fall, so easily you reach your hand out. So quickly will I drown, in all the pools of all my reason. So easily will I fear, so easily will your peace surpass me. So quickly will I trust, in anything I think is worthy</segment1>
		<segment2>How many times you make the waves calm down. So I won't be afraid now. I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall. What am I suppose to do</segment2>
		<segment3>How precious are your thoughts. The way that you think about me. How faithful are your ways. I always feel you grace abounding. How quickly will I call. How quickly will you answer my cry. How carefully will you bring everything I need in my life</segment3>
		<segment4>How many times you make the waves calm down. So I won't be afraid now. I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall. What am I suppose to do</segment4>
		<segment5>This narrow road I'm walking, This world will I try to draw. Your work will help me fight it. With you I'll face it all</segment5>
		<segment6>I saw you breaking my, breaking my fall. What am I suppose to do    </segment6>
