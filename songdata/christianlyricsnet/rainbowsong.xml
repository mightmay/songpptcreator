		<segment1>If I was a rainbow I'd show my colors for You. If I was a songbird I'd sing my song for You. And if You take the sun and the moon. Take away the stars at night. Your faithful Word will always be my light</segment1>
		<segment2>Beautiful such a miracle. That You would give up Heaven just for me. All I wanna do is fall more in love with You. This world doesn't owe me anymore. And one thing that I do know for sure    </segment2>
