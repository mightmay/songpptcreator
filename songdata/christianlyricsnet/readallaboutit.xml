		<segment1>I get my head together on a Saturday morning. a victim of the night it's called social action. I'm just trying to keep up with the times. moving with the crowd and they want it loud. I keep saying I'll never do it again. same old line I'm right back out there again</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: you can read all about it. you can read all about it. you can read all about it. you can read all about it. my eyes catch the morning paper on hte table. it's a brand new day but nothing's changed. sickness crime and poverty are the headlines. I can see the world through different eyes now. peace love and harmony. the Bible says these are good for me. I thank God for the good news today</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus x2)    </segment3>
