		<segment1>I bought my ticket and I paid in cash. I thought that this time the ride would last. And lead me to what I am looking for</segment1>
		<segment2>I see the world as it rushes by. But nothing new is grabbing my eye. Just everything that I have tried before</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe I've been looking in the wrong place. Maybe I've been thinking that the world will. Fill me up full enough but it never works that way</segment3>
		<segment4>There is just one thing that fills me up. One thing that's true. There is just one thing that satisfies. That one thing is You</segment4>
		<segment5>Show me everything I did not see. While I was searching the world for what was right in front of me. So much wasted wasting time</segment5>
		<segment6>I see that I've been headed down the wrong track. Now I don't wanna ever go back. To the way it was all because. You're all I'll ever need</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm tired of settling for this world and its bitter dreams. There's nothing here that satisfies like You     </segment7>
