		<segment1>Wake up, Talitha cumi, wake up!. Wake up, Talitha cumi, wake up!. The girl's just sound asleep. Why cause this commotion and weep. So move on over if youre in shock. And clear this unbelief. Wake up, Talitha cumi, wake up, Talitha cumi. Well  trust in God, I tell your mama. Trust in God, I tell your pa. Trust in God when all your friends they nay say. Prove them wrong. Wake up, Talitha cumi, wake up, Talitha cumi. Well, they told your mom and dad you were dead right then. Well, you'll be raised so looks like they goofed again. Wake up, Talitha cumi, wake up, Talitha cumi. You gotta have hope. CHORUS. The mourners must've forgot. They're pickin' out burial plots. They failed to see that you have booked. Your resurrection with God. Wake up, Talitha cumi, wake up, Talitha cumi. Well, what weve done theyll tell in Mark 5. But for now well tell no one. What weve done theyll tell again in Luke 8. You got up!     </segment1>
