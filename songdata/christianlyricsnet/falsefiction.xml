		<segment1>They guarantee our freedom but freedom isn't real. Unless you know Christ you won't know how I feel. Inflections of the way things were supposed to be. The mental disorder of our society. False finite ways of thinking. False fiction they're believing. Entropy is still promoting chaos. It's chaos, it's your loss. Maybe this world has stopped thinking. Maybe all their minds are shrinking. Your failed system is inducing chaos. It's chaos, it's your loss. Building, moving forward never looking back. Taking what the world has offered, but you forgot the pack. Common sense,logic,science, a humble self esteem. Live to die and die to gain, abort the selfish scene.     </segment1>
