		<segment1>When success is equated with excess. The ambition for excess wrecks us. When top of the mind becomes the bottom line. When success is equated with excess</segment1>
		<segment2>If you're time ain't be nothing for money. I start to feel really bad for you honey. Maybe honey put you're money where your mouth's been running. If you're time ain't be nothing but money</segment2>
		<segment3>I want out of this machine. It doesn't feel like freedom</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). This ain't my American dream. I want to live and die for bigger things. I'm tired of fighting for just me. This ain't my American dream</segment4>
		<segment5>When success is equated with excess. When we're fighting for the beamer, the lexus. As the heart and soul breathing the company goals. Where success is equated with excess</segment5>
		<segment6>I want out of this machine. It doesn't feel like freedom</segment6>
		<segment7>(chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>Cause baby's always talkin 'bout a ring. And talk has always been the cheapest thing. Is it true would you do what I want you to. If I show up with the right amount of bling?</segment8>
		<segment9>Like a puppet on a monetary string. Maybe we've been caught singing. Red, white, blue, and green. But that ain't my America, That ain't my American dream</segment9>
		<segment10>(chorus)    </segment10>
