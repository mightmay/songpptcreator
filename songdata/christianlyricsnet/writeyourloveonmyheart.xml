		<segment1>I'm waiting for a miracle I. 'm waiting for a star to fall. I'm bankrupt and worn out. I need to know You' re here now. When I' ve got nothing left to say. And I don't know how to pray. Would You Write Your love on my heart. When I struggle just to feel. And I wonder if You' re real Would You. Write Your love on my heart. Write Your love on my heart. Take this condemnation. And all of my frustration. Lift me out of the mud. Come and fill an empty cup. When I' ve got nothing left to say. And I don't know how to pray Would You. Write Your love on my heart. When I struggle just to feel. And I wonder if You' re real Would You. Write Your love on my heart. Write Your love on my heart. Cause Your love opens eyes to see. Your love breaks through walls that surround me. Your love cries out from the deep to save me. When I' ve got nothing left to say. And I don't know how to pray Would You. Write Your love on my heart. When I struggle just to feel. And I wonder if You' re real Would You. Write Your love on my heart. Write Your love on my heart. Write Your love on my heart. Write Your love on my heart. Write Your love on my heart    </segment1>
