		<segment1>Hope you relate to me when I say. I won't let you out my mind. I had a little dream and the dream went like this. A little bit like this. I had a little dream and the dream went like this. I saw two little girls sittin' both without a wish. Saw through Your heart and through Your very eyes. To the holes the size from lies. Oh yes indeed cuz things have been mixed and twixed. In with the recipe. And it's gotta be fixed, hey yo I'm talkin' to you. And me and everybody. We sound a bit like this. You're on my mind you're on my mind. You're on my mind again. Know you relate to me when I say. I won't let you out my mind. I'll take the rest of my time and all my rhymes. Devoted be yours to share with you and my life. It's so very good to chill and listen to your experience. Never regret what I said it's all true. But song after song and song after song. I'd do anything for y'all. My mind can't get you out. I'm gonna chain you to my heart and chain you to my soul. Gonna do what I gotta do to fill the hole. I can't explain it can't stop saying it. I wanna take you to Heaven. I pray and pray each and everyday. And hope and cry that when I die. I'll say goodbye but not for long. I'll see you in Heaven.     </segment1>
