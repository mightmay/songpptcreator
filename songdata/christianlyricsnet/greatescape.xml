		<segment1>Escaping to nowhere, nowhere. You run and find that you are nowhere. Circles in your paths. Streets are empty</segment1>
		<segment2>You'll find chaotic voices. In your head guiding false. You'll never seem to find your way. Streets dark and empty</segment2>
		<segment3>Nowhere to trot to. Thoughts of fear in your mind. All alone, nowhere to go. You turn on the radio. To escape your thoughts</segment3>
		<segment4>Nothing seems to make sense. 'Cause everything is gray. And you'll never find your way. Lost in you own dismay</segment4>
		<segment5>Running around with your head chopped off. You only last a few seconds. 'Cause you're not. You're not, you're not    </segment5>
