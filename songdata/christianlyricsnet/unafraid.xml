		<segment1>Woke up this morning. with you in our bed. going over and over. everything you said. Who talk you how to speak. the words that you say. I've always wanted to. be talked to that way. Love has made. has made you unafraid. . Watching my children. finding their way. thru struggles and triumphs. and heartbreak. I hope the roads they take. Are making them strong. I'll still be on my knees. Long after they're gone. Love has made. Love has made. Love has made. Has made me unafraid. . My lovely mother. Is getting on in years. And the way her body's aging. brings her girls to tears. The way she trembles with. each effort she makes. She just says Heaven's. getting closer each day. Love has made. Love has made. Love has made. Has made her unafraid. . Love could make. Love can make. Love will make. Make you unafraid..    </segment1>
