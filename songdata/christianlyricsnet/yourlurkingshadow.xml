		<segment1>The party rages on that night. Thoughts trickle in my mind, remember it's my time. Bottled all my regrets inside. The cap is turning loose hold on and I refuse. With open eyes and two deaf ears. Lights are flashing bright, causing me to go blind. With you always stuck in my mind. Wherever I may go, you follow me around</segment1>
		<segment2>I can see you I can know when you're around. Your attitude brings me down. I can feel you I can know when you're around. Your scent so close I can feel you</segment2>
		<segment3>You crossed my double yellow line. Traffic caused to swerve, causing me to lose my nerve. The leaves are falling oh so bright. Falling round and round, turn brown when hit the ground. Your whispers ringing in my ear. Temptation growing near, you can smell the fear. With you always stuck in my thoughts. Wherever I may go, you follow me around.     </segment3>
