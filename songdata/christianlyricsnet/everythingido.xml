		<segment2>Everything I do let it be in your name. Let it be for your glory let it be for you. Everything I say let it be in your name. Let it be to your glory let it be for your sake. Cuz I wanna please you in everything I do</segment2>
		<segment3>I want the world to see you, when they look at me. I want the world to hear you in every word I speak. So let my words be your words and my actions too. So they'll find the new life that I have found in you</segment3>
		<segment4>Everything I do let it be in your name. Let it be for your glory let it be for you. Everything I say let it be in your name. Let it be to your glory let it be for your sake. Cuz I wanna please you in everything I do</segment4>
