		<segment1>Kicked and stabbed along the way, planning for the hour. Revenge a method, one of many. to consummate the change.</segment1>
		<segment2>Why, what could you ever gain?. Nothing it seems except being lame. What, what could you ever lose?. Brutally wrong, its all a game.</segment2>
		<segment3>Moving forward, leaving something. requires the unsaid. Be a man and let it all go, abandoning your pride.</segment3>
		<segment4>Why, what could you ever gain?. Nothing it seems except being lame. What, what could you ever lose?. Brutally wrong, its all a game. (x 2)</segment4>
		<segment5>Now its here, time to choose. You decide. what youll become.</segment5>
		<segment6>Why, what could you ever gain?. Nothing it seems except being lame. What, what could you ever lose?. Brutally wrong, its all a game. (x 2)    </segment6>
