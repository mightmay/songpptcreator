		<segment1>Alone, alone is where I'll be. Waiting, waiting so patiently. Escape this little war raging. One Still Small Voice. Come rescue me </segment1>
		<segment2>Why wait, why wait. Why wait for You to Usher Me Down. Many o, many o, Lord, my God. The wonders that I have found. When You usher me down </segment2>
		<segment3>Sacrifice and offering. You do not desire of me. I say here I am, You come. As if I ever had to call </segment3>
		<segment4>Why wait, why wait. Why wait for You to Usher Me Down. Many o, many o, Lord, my God. The wonders that I have found. When You usher me down </segment4>
		<segment5>Who could replace You?. None I know of. The Throne is Yours alone. Left to stand unshaken. Can't be taken back. Can't be taken back </segment5>
		<segment6>Why wait, why wait. Why wait for You to Usher Me Down. Many o, many o, Lord, my God. The wonders that I have found. When You usher me down </segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
