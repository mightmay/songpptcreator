		<segment1>I never knew you but you seemed to be, to me, a great man. wise as a serpent and gentle as a hillside white lamb. we heard your voice. we saw your choice. it's written on us</segment1>
		<segment2>I wish I'd know you and learned the way to walk the narrow path. but I am grateful that you left your words to follow like a map. within the dark land you gave us a lamp. by which we might see</segment2>
		<segment3>we heard your voice. we saw your choice. it's written on us</segment3>
		<segment4>and we walk the ground that you shook. we read the words in your book. and learn how to break our own ground. all the lambs will roar beautiful sounds    </segment4>
