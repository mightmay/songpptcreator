		<segment1>When I was young I had a blast boy. The ways of the past. They're cool they're fun they're good. But I wonder will it last. I don't know I don't think so. What we need is a little yo narly ho. So we yo we heave ho. We turn up the sound. We run around. We put a little juice in your town. We talk about the Lord and all that we found in him. You wonder what we do. We're aiming at you. We're bonified preachers. Spiritual snipers. Gonna take your soul. One step hyper </segment1>
		<segment2>One step hyper. One step hyper. One step hyper </segment2>
		<segment3>Now we're in the race. Gotta a reason for a rhyme. And a rhyme for a reason. With God's help we set the pace. We're Audio A. And we're in your face. Yeah your face and we ain't dissin. We're talkin abou something you've been missing. Become like the man that you wish you were. You got a friend and you can be sure. The Lord God almighty faithful and pure. Full of power holy and true. Hit the streets get off your pew. Fight the fight till the fight is through. Now you know what you gonna do. Let's crank it up He died for you </segment3>
		<segment4>One step hyper. One step hyper. One step hyper </segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes things just go too slow. You wanna run jump and dance and go. There may be times you want a beat. To move your head and not your feet. Fired up and ready the Lord is alive. So get your souls moving for a big joy ride. So let's kick it for the King. Lets open up and sing. Let's have a little fun as we crush the viper. Time to get. One step hyper </segment5>
		<segment6>One step hyper. One step hyper. One step hyper     </segment6>
