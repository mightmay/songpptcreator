		<segment1>Hearts aren't really our guides. We are truly alone. 'Cause God ain't up in the sky, Holding together our bones. </segment1>
		<segment2>Remember we used to speak. Now I'm starting to think, Your voice was really my own, Bouncing off the ceiling back to me. </segment2>
		<segment3>God, this can't be. God, this can't be, God, could it be that all we see is it? </segment3>
		<segment4>Come down, heaven. Won't you come down?. Won't you cut through the clouds?. Won't you come down? </segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, my heaven, why do you have doors to close?. Do you have clouds to stop his voice on the way down? </segment5>
		<segment6>God, this can't be. God, this can't be, God, could it be that all we see is it? </segment6>
		<segment7>God, does grace reach to this side of madness?. 'Cause I know this can't be, The great peace we all seek. </segment7>
		<segment8>Come down, heaven. Won't you come down?. Won't you cut through the clouds?. Won't you come down?.     </segment8>
