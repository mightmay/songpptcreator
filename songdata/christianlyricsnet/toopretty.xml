		<segment1>It's obvious what you think about me. Cause you won't even give me a chance. I don't mind what you say about me. When you talk to your friends all the time</segment1>
		<segment2>Was it something I said to you. To make you think that I was just a fool. Or maybe</segment2>
		<segment3>You're too pretty. You're too pretty for me. I don't want to let you down</segment3>
		<segment4>You're too pretty. You're too pretty for me. I don't want to wear that crown</segment4>
		<segment5>One day you're gonna wish you'd given me a chance. When I'm standing on top of the world. And you're stuck down there in your fantasy. With all your diamonds and pearls</segment5>
		<segment6>Was it something I said to you. To make you think that I was just a fool. Or maybe</segment6>
		<segment7>You're too pretty. You're too pretty for me. I don't want to let you down</segment7>
		<segment8>You're too pretty. You're too pretty for me. I don't want to wear that crown</segment8>
		<segment9>I never got up the nerve. To say to you what I wanted to. If I had a choice you know that I would. Turn back the hands of time    </segment9>
