		<segment1>I once was fatherless. A stranger with no hope. Your kindness wakened me. Awakened me, from my sleep</segment1>
		<segment2>Your love it beckons deeply. A call to come and die. By grace now I will come. And take this life, take Your life</segment2>
		<segment3>Sin has lost it's power. Death has lost it's sting. From the grave you've risen. Victoriously!</segment3>
		<segment4>Into marvelous light I'm running. Out of darkness, out of shame. By the cross You are the truth. You are the life, You are the way</segment4>
		<segment5>My dead heart now is beating. My deepest stains now clean. Your breath fills up my lungs. Now I'm free, now I'm free!</segment5>
		<segment6>Lift my hands and spin around. See the light that I have found. Oh the marvelous light. Marvelous light Â…    </segment6>
