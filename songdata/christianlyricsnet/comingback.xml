		<segment1>I am broken, there's nowhere left to hide. I'm drowning in need of your lifeline. I'm desperate, I'm on my knees again. Surrendered. [ Lyrics from: http://www.cloverlyrics.com/e83742-ben_cantelon~coming_back_lyrics.html ]. I have had all the riches of this world. They could never, ever take your place</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm coming back to you, my love. I've had enough of what I've become. I'm coming back to you. I'm coming back to you</segment2>
		<segment3>I am reaching up to a higher ground. But gravity has got a hold on me. But I know your love will see me. Through this darkness</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm coming back to you my love. I've had enough of what I've become. I'm coming back to you. I'm coming back to you</segment4>
		<segment5>Take my heart and make it clean. I'm overwhelmed as your grace covers me. I'm coming back to you. I'm coming back to you</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm coming back, I'm coming back to you. I'm coming back, I'm coming back to you. Break me, mold me, heal me, restore me. You are my hope, you are my hope. Hold me closely, never let go. You are my hope, you are my hope    </segment6>
