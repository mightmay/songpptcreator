		<segment1>To my surprise I found my daylight. In summer skies yeah woah. Colors came out in waves. When i first saw your face shine through. A spotlight fell that day. I'll make this loud so you can hear me say</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey there one in a million. I feel alive as our love it collides. You put life into motion. You've got me spinning. You're spinning me out of control. Girl dream big. We'll do it all. When the city calls. Hand in hand this is love. Buildings tower over us. You're a queen won't you dance won't you sing. Your melody (your melody). Smile for the best days exist. I'm the luckiest your the reason for this</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey there one in a million. I feel alive as our love it collides. You put life into motion. You've got me spinning. You're spinning me out of control. As my life explodes. You've got me hanging on I'm hanging on. I'm out of control as my life explodes. You've got me hanging on forever. We're hanging on together. We're hanging on forever</segment3>
		<segment4>Hey there one in a million. One in a million. Life's in motion. You've got me spinning. As our world's collide</segment4>
		<segment5>Hey there one in a million. I feel alive as our love it collides. You put life into motion. You've got me spinning. You're spinning me out of control    </segment5>
