		<segment1>Lord I stand in awe of You. 'Cause everything I know. Fails to compare to. You and You alone. Taken by Your majesty. I am overcome. By the power of. What Your hand has done (Yeah)</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I could never quite express. The beauty of your holiness. You're the Holy One. I could never quite define. The way You've changed this heart of mine. You're the Holy One. You're the Holy One. You're the Holy One</segment2>
		<segment3>There's no counting all the ways. That You have been so true. You're faithful to the end. You're faithful thru and thru. You are more than wonderful. You are everything. You mean more than love. More than life to me (Yeah)</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: Holy, You are Lord over all the earth. Let us see your glory. I will lift You up for You loved me first. For You are the holy, Holy One, Holy One, Holy One..</segment4>
