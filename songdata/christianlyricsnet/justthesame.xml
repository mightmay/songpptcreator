		<segment1>I don't want to be the one to break you. But could I please borrow some change. You see my car's broke down and I need some gasoline. It's cold out here do you know what I mean</segment1>
		<segment2>Did I let you down. Did I throw away all your expectations</segment2>
		<segment3>So I reached in my pocket and I grabbed some change. I said it's nice to meet you, what's your name. You look like you could use a friend</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause I'm not like all the rest. Cause I know what it's like to be down on your luck. And you and me we're just the same</segment4>
		<segment5>It probably won't make a difference. But they say you get what you give. And I feel lucky for the things I have. Cause God knows man that ain't no way to live</segment5>
		<segment6>Did I let you down. Did I throw away all your expectations</segment6>
		<segment7>I didn't mean to hurt you. I didn't even stop. I didn't even give you the time to explain your situation. I got my own situation. It's true in a lot of ways. I'm just like you</segment7>
		<segment8>So I reached in my pocket and I grabbed some change. I said it's nice to meet you, what's your name. You look like you could use a friend</segment8>
		<segment9>I'm not like all the rest. Cause I know what it's like to be down on your luck. And you and me we're just the same    </segment9>
