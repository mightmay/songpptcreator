		<segment1>[CHORUS:]. You alone are what my soul needs. You know the thirst is taking over. Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need. You know the thirst is taking over</segment1>
		<segment2>The thirst is taking over</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold me down, hold me down. Drip it on my tongue. And my convulsions stop. Thirst for love, thirst for your love. I could swallow your beauty whole</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>Running out, times running out. Searching for the one who can conquer me. I'm going to scream aloud, throw it down. Crash in the sweet obsession of you. I'm going to swim and drown in the wake of you</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]</segment6>
		<segment7>The thirst is taking over. I wanna taste it. I need to taste it. Deep in the Saviors arms</segment7>
		<segment8>[CHORUS]</segment8>
		<segment9>I wanna drink you in. I am drinking you in. I wanna drink you in</segment9>
		<segment10>Hardly breathe, I'm in urgent need. You know the thirst is taking over. The thirst is taking over</segment10>
		<segment11>I wanna taste it. I need to taste it. Deep in the Saviors arms    </segment11>
