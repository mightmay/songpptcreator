		<segment1>I can see you're hurting. Trying to hide your fear and pain. You feel a hunger and an emptiness. That you cannot explain. I can give you freedom. There's a whole new kind of life. That's waiting if you open up. the door I can give you more. All that you hope for</segment1>
		<segment2>Put your trust in Me and you will see. That I am all you need. I can set you free. Just reach out to Me. I have made the sacrifice for paradise. That waits in store. I can give you more All your doubt and heartache. You can leave the past behind. I'm the answers to the questions. That are weighing on your mind</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll be waiting for you. Here with open arms to give you love. Like you have never known before. More than you could ever dream. I'll be there night and day. If you put all your faith and hope in Me. Eternity is just a prayer away    </segment3>
