		<segment3>To the core of my being, Ill stand tall and Ill stand true. To the core of my being, Ill stand tall and Ill stand true.</segment3>
		<segment4>Savior such hypocrisy, this was not intended. The truth will set you free for all eternity.. eternity. These chains Ive wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone. These chains Ive wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone. These chains Ive wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone. These chains Ive wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone.</segment4>
