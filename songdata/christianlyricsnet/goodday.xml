		<segment1>Why cant you just leave me alone?. Just when I thought you were gone. You threw it up in my face. Why cant you accept that I made a mistake?. Let it, let it go. Let it, let it go</segment1>
		<segment2>You never let me free. Youre like a ball and chain. Take a piece of me and never hesitate. Like gravity you bring me down. And Im not gonna take it, not gonna take it. Feel it, I can feel it, I wont take it, I can feel it. Its a good day, to bid you good day </segment2>
		<segment3>Will you ever let me walk away?. You keep reminding me of yesterday. Youre so stuck on bringing me down. You should know by now that Im not sticking around. Let it, let it go. Let it, let it go</segment3>
		<segment4>Gotta let, gotta let, gotta let this go. Gotta let, gotta let, gotta let it go. Gotta let me go. Cause Im not gonna take it, not gonna, goodbye</segment4>
		<segment5>Its a good day. Goodbye lies, lame stories. Out my face, out the way, Im warning. You manipulate, complicate, dont ignore me. Its a good day, to bid you good day. Its a good day. Goodbye lies, lame stories. Out my face, out my way, Im warning. You manipulate, complicate, dont ignore me. Its a good day, to bid you good day </segment5>
		<segment6>So say goodbye, dont try hello. Its past the time for you to go. Im happy now that youre out the way. Cant believe, I played your sorry games. Ive let you go, its such a good feelin. And I wont be seeing you again. Its a good day, to bid you good day    </segment6>
