		<segment2>Fire thats so contagious. Its taking over me. And you cant stop it</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, oh. Turn the lights down so we can. Glow, glow. Watch us come alive. Were gonna. Show you something real. Like a city on a hill. Oh, oh. Were gonna glow</segment3>
		<segment4>They see us coming from miles away. Theres no hiding, no denying, cause were not ashamed. With our hands up in the air. Boys and girls they start to stare. Its a wonder, can you feel it</segment4>
		<segment5>We will not be silent. Wont hide it. The time is now. And you cant stop it</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, oh, here we go. Welcome to the show. Lights shining, so blinding. From our head to our toes. When this room blacks out. You know we will stand out. So come on, oh. Were gonna glow!</segment6>
		<segment7>They see us coming from miles away. Theres no hiding, no denying, cause were not ashamed. With our hands up in the air. Boys and girls they start to stare. Its a wonder, can you feel it</segment7>
		<segment8>Oh, oh here we go. Like a shooting star. Well l-l-l-light up your heart</segment8>
		<segment9>They see us coming from miles away. Theres no hiding, no denying, cause were not ashamed. With our hands up in the air. Boys and girls they start to stare. Its a wonder, can you feel it</segment9>
