		<segment1>Words of high cost (you spit a curse at my name). When thoughts of hate cross (I can't devour your blame). This is your choice (this is your hammer to crush). I have no voice (you're not the hand that I trust)</segment1>
		<segment2>Throw it down on me. Throw it down on me.</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Before you break your silence, before we tear this open.. We'll count the dead and hopeless for every word unspoken.</segment3>
		<segment4>Thoughts, like blood, run (forever staining our hands). Mouth like cold gun (before the barrel we stand). The latest and the last (you put a price on my head). The latest and the last (the worst is already said)</segment4>
		<segment5>(CHORUS)</segment5>
		<segment6>Spilling through your teeth. You're sick of what you've seen. You point your guilt at every step we took in loyalty. [repeat]</segment6>
		<segment7>(CHORUS)</segment7>
		<segment8>Throw it down on me. Throw it down.    </segment8>
