		<segment1>Got a feeling that you can't do anything you believe. It's not a secret that you take back anything underneath</segment1>
		<segment2>Can't be blamed won't be fooled. Pocket full of nothing if you don't keep cool. Out of place, don't fit in. Never finish something if you can't begin</segment2>
		<segment3>Then you tell me you read like the perfect ending. Gone without a trace. Take a minute to mention everything that you question. You lost the human race. Another chip on your shoulder got a lot to get over. You swear you wanted this</segment3>
		<segment4>It's underwhelming how the day gets started how. You begin you begin. You wouldn't notice if the street just sounded like violins. violins</segment4>
		<segment5>So take a step start again. It's never quite an issue to remember when. Stomp your feet lose the knack. on the way you'll figure out the best way back</segment5>
		<segment6>Then you tell me you read like the perfect ending. Gone without a trace. Take a minute to mention everything that you question. You lost the human race. Another chip on your shoulder got a lot to get over. You swear you wanted this</segment6>
		<segment7>Even when you walk away it feels like running. If you turn your head a certain way. You might see something good</segment7>
		<segment8>Gone without a trace. Take a minute to mention everything that you question. You lost the human race. Another chip on your shoulder got a lot to get over. Gone without a trace. Take a minute to mention everything that you question. You lost the human race. Another chip on your shoulder got a lot to get over. You swear you wanted this.     </segment8>
