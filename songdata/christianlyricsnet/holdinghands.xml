		<segment1>One day, far away, you gently won my heart. And one night, by candlelight, we made a vow to never part. And then it seemed just like a dream. When wide eyed, side by side. We faced the future holding hands</segment1>
		<segment2>Years fly, they hurry by, the simple times are gone. Bills due, a kid or two, a week can feel eight days long. By fading light, let's kiss goodnight. And then we trace God's daily grace. Thankful we're still holding hands</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a hope that won't let go. There's a truth we know. God is holding us. In His arms</segment3>
		<segment4>Thoughts stray far away to all that lies ahead. In frail days when strength fades. Will we still mean all that we said?. Our love's secure, so rest assured. Come what may 'til that day. We'll walk forever holding hands</segment4>
		<segment5>By God's grace 'til that day. We'll walk forever holding hands    </segment5>
