		<segment1>She says she's just a girl. I think there's something more. She says You changed her world</segment1>
		<segment2>And the smile on her face is a dead giveaway. And I just got to know</segment2>
		<segment3>So won't you tell me. Is there something more to You. Maybe You could be the one for me. And turn my life into. Just what I need. Maybe You could save my soul. Maybe You could be my best friend, too. Maybe You</segment3>
		<segment4>There's something in her eyes. Something behind her smile. She says You changed her life</segment4>
		<segment5>Well maybe You or maybe not. All I want is what she's got. And I just got to know</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>She says no one knows her like You do. She says she's nothing without You. And all I know is that I need You, too. Cause I can't see her without seeing You    </segment7>
