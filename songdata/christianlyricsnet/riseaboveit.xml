		<segment1>Another couple kids with their heads on top.  Just another stranger just another plot.  Another track home where the city streets stop.  Just another kid with another bored cop</segment1>
		<segment2> Just another lemon into lemonade job.  Just another rust and dust facade.  Just another key stuck broken in the lock.  Just another scarecrow choking on a cough.  Oh come on! </segment2>
		<segment3> It all feels so typical.  Guess I'm looking for a miracle.  Rise above it.  I don't care what their telling me.  We could be what we want to be</segment3>
		<segment4> Rise above it. [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/s/switchfoot/rise_above_it.html ].  Listen up loud listen up listen here.  Just because you're running.  Doesn't mean that you're scared.  Just because it's law doesn't mean it is fair.  Never let another tell your soul what to fear</segment4>
		<segment5> Here we go again give it one more try.  Don't believe the system's on your side.  Just another lover turned enemy fight</segment5>
		<segment6> Just another blood and nicotine sky.  Oh come on! </segment6>
		<segment7> It feels so difficult.  Guess I'm looking for a miracle.  I get so sick of it.  It feels so counferfeit.  I rise above it.  Rise above it</segment7>
		<segment8> Hear our voices rise.  Hear our battle cry.  We've been under the curse.  With our arms raised high.  Hear us sing tonight.  Like the last night on earth.  We will rise like the tide.  Like dead men.  Coming back to life.  We are rising.  Rising.  Turn it up now, listen loud and clear.  Just because you're present.  Doesn't mean you're here.  Oh come on! </segment8>
		<segment9> Let's rise above it.  We can rise above it    </segment9>
