		<segment1>You never ever leave my mind. My sweet sweet Madeline. Every time I look into your eyes. I feel like I'm alive</segment1>
		<segment2>And I can barely make a sound. Whenever you're around. You can find me hiding in the crowd. Next time you come to town</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey! Hey! I've been waitin' all day!</segment3>
		<segment4>Every time I want to say hello. Every time I want to stay, I go. Can't ever find the words to let you know. Sometimes you play my mind a million times</segment4>
		<segment5>Wish I could somehow let you know. That all the way from here to Mexico. You're the one and only girl for me hehe. Tu es un, bonjour, oui oui</segment5>
		<segment6>And my tongue gets tied so quick. I get so nervous I'm feelin' sick. And turn into the world's worst Romeo. Every time I try to say hello</segment6>
		<segment7>You're so fine, been on my mind. Get nervous every time I see you hop online     </segment7>
