		<segment1>I got a message. I got a song. Can I get a witness. Tell me what's going on</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll show the people. A better way. Maybe I will tomorrow. Maybe I will today</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause I got a feeling it won't be long. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong. But I know one thing for sure. Only time will tell it. I got a feeling coming over me. Nothing else here can set me free. But I know one thing for sure. Well, I've got to show it</segment3>
		<segment4>I got a mission. I got a sign. Is anybody listening. I gotta make sure this time. I'll tell the people. What's on my mind. Maybe I will tomorrow. Maybe I will tonight</segment4>
		<segment5>I got a message. I got a song. Everybody help me sing along.     </segment5>
