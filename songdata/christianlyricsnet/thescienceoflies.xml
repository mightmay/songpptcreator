		<segment1>Bow down- before the god of cash. The philosophy of modern man is seaking fast. No foundation for the frame by which you set your mind. Just a legacy of fiction for the feeble to find. Desperation breeding faith unto a pitiful lie. Give us your money and we'll open up our gullible eyes. No redemption, not a reason, but a symbol of why. This digression of surrender is the science of lies </segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Believe the sacred blasphemy. They feed. That hollow voice inside of your head. Receive the fleeting fallacy. They breathe. Trace every step from where you were led. Look back and tell yourself what they said. (Now flee) </segment2>
		<segment3>And now you feel it pulling down. How can you buy into a faith that hasn't permanent ground?. Give me blood-soaked, sacrificial worth. Not the artificial product of a fraudulent birth. Give me selfless, consecrated reprise. Not a worthless contribution to the science of lies </segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus] </segment4>
		<segment5>Feel it pulling down.     </segment5>
