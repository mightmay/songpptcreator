		<segment1>Mountain maker. Ocean tamer. Glimpses of You. Burn in my eyes. The worship of heaven. Fills up the skies </segment1>
		<segment2>You made it all. Said, &quot;let there be&quot;. And there was. All that we see. The sound of Your voice. The works of Your hands. You do all things well. You do all things well. You do all things well </segment2>
		<segment3>Star creator. Wind breather. The strokes of Your beauty. Brushed through the clouds. Light from the heavens. Touching the ground </segment3>
		<segment4>Imagination runs wild. And breathes the breath of life. Across the fields. Across the miles    </segment4>
