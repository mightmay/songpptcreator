		<segment1>Lord, the light of your love is shining. In the midst of the darkness, shining. Jesus, Light of the world, shine upon us. Set us free by the truth you now bring us. Shine on me, shine on me</segment1>
		<segment2>Shine, Jesus, shine. Fill this land with the Father's glory. Blaze, Spirit, blaze. Set our hearts on fire. Flow, river, flow. Flood the nations with grace and mercy. Send forth your word. Lord, and let there be light</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, I come to your awesome presence. From the shadows into your radiance. By the blood I may enter your brightness. Search me, try me, consume all my darkness. Shine on me, shine on me</segment3>
		<segment4>As we gaze on your kingly brightness. So our faces display your likeness. Ever changing from glory to glory. Mirrored here may our lives tell your story. Shine on me, shine on me</segment4>
