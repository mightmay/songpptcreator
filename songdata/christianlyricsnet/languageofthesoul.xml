		<segment1>You don't have to say it out loud. One look can cut to the bone. A quick glare when the angry hurts there. Tells me just what i've done wrong</segment1>
		<segment2>Your eyes can speak to me. Deeper then words can go. Your eyes can reach for me. Tears are the language of the soul</segment2>
		<segment3>When a smile lights up your eyes. Laughter can't say what you could. With your sweet stare it's like heaven is there. And an overflow of everything good</segment3>
		<segment4>Your eyes can speak to me. Deeper then words can go. Your eyes can reach for me. Tears are the language of the soul</segment4>
		<segment5>Dancing waters dark harbors. Tears have every reason to fall. Like pounding rain or gentle whispers. Oh i listen when they talk</segment5>
		<segment6>Your eyes can speak to me. Deeper then words can go. Your eyes can reach for me. Tears are the language of the soul    </segment6>
