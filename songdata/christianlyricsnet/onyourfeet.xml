		<segment1>Sitting up here so high above the ground, feeling just a little like I can't be pushed around, Just for a minute feeling invincible. Then I'm hit with the principle. Everyday while I'm away I here my brothers slipping away. Taught by the same teachers who give. The lies for you to live. Can't understand what's so hard to comprehend. about the words of the father and his loving command. Push back, heart attack, get down, come around, get your fist full of embrace, back to the crown, back stab lies hypocrites that paralyze forthcoming events. It's gonna blow your mind. Get up off your hands get on your feet. You're sitting up there like you never heard of him. it's like you're running, running away from him. it's like you caught up in a dream no reality, nothing is what it seems. Everyday while I'm away I hear my brothers slipping away. Taught by the same teachers who give the lies for you to live. They taught me about the evolution of man, They say I was a monkey who walked the land. Just once I wish they could see where I'm coming from, Instead of society being so dumb. Lies for you to live, is where their coming from, lies for you to live, stop playing dumb, Can't understand what's so hard to comprehend. about the word of the father and his loving command. Push back, heart attack, get down, come around, get your fist full of embrace, back to the crown, back stab lies hypocrites that paralyze forthcoming events. It's gonna blow your mind. Get up off your hands get on your feet.    </segment1>
