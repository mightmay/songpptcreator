		<segment1>Walking with You is not without hazards. Tripping's this traveler's curse. The price paid for falling is more than my stumble. In a world that is watching and waiting for worst</segment1>
		<segment2>But I listened when you said to go. And I set out in spite of my fears. I brought truth mixed with my imperfections. And the question of what to say when I got here. And now that I'm here</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Should I tell them that You are. The One who has made me. And saved me to set up a home there inside. Should I tell them that I am. A perfect example of all You can do with a life. What should I say to them, what if I'm failing them?. What should I tell them tonight?</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't get me wrong. I'm thankful to be here. With this song to sing and a spotlight on me. But lately I'm wondering if You are mistaken. If You're seeing all of me there is to see</segment4>
		<segment5>But on every face I detect. These same questions I've posed to you. Like do You speak through the imperfect. Or are we too dirty for Your light to get through. I want You're light to get through</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>'Cause they're thirsty but my cup is empty, Lord. Come and meet me here in this place. 'Cause I'm unashamed, but I'm unprepared. And I'm just plain afraid</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus x2)     </segment8>
