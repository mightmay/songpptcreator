		<segment1>We're the last of the sleepless ones. Left behind by those we left behind tonight. Quiet now, let the boys in take. Were we always just your lost cause mistakes? </segment1>
		<segment2>Wait for me, will you wait for me?. I need you on my side. Wait for me, will you wait for me?. With arms wide. </segment2>
		<segment3>Alone, left alone. Watch us slowly disappear with time. Alone, still alone. Forgotten, lost, and left behind. </segment3>
		<segment4>Darklit streets are no place for kids. But it gives us more of a home than anywhere we've lived. We're the scientists left to our own demise. You're still our last chance to get out of this place alive. Wait for me, will you wait for me with arms wide? </segment4>
		<segment5>Alone, left alone. Watch us slowly disappear with time. Alone, still alone. Forgotten, lost, and left behind. </segment5>
		<segment6>Alone, left alone. Watch us slowly disappear in time. </segment6>
		<segment7>Alone, left alone. Watch us slowly disappear with time. Alone, still alone. Forgotten, lost! </segment7>
		<segment8>We're left alone, left alone. Watch us slowly disappear with time. Alone, still alone. Forgotten, lost and left behind.     </segment8>
