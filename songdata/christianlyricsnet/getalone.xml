		<segment1>Get alone. Get alone</segment1>
		<segment2>Get alone. Get alone. Get alone. Get alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Get alone. Get alone. Get alone. Get alone</segment3>
		<segment4>Man its a shame. Its a stumbling block. and it seems Ive found the order to this sour addiction. Ive grown accustom to it showering me. Switched gears but the cycle isnt making it easy. I was running, I was running on empty ideas, but I had to write them down just to listen. Im flying over the ocean and back. I breathe in, I breathe out. I breathe in, I breathe out. I breathe in.</segment4>
		<segment5>Get alone, when the others are blinding. Get alone, leave distraction behind me. Get alone, where the streets are defining. Get alone, theyre always there and reminding.</segment5>
		<segment6>Get alone, when the others are blinding. Get alone, leave distraction behind me. Get alone, where the streets are defining. Get alone, theyre always there and reminding.</segment6>
		<segment7>Riding. Distance restore me. Im finding serenity in the structure. Finding serenity on this route. Distance restore me.</segment7>
		<segment8>Adding up, adding up all the stakes. Lining up, lining up and dissecting. Id rather address them while I. Id rather address them while I can. If Im not mistaken I will. If Im not mistaken I will. If Im not mistaken I will. Steer it through in a graceful way. Ill abandon. Leave the rest behind. The weight might not settle in time.</segment8>
		<segment9>Man its a shame. Its a stumbling block. and it seems Ive found the order to this sour addiction. Ive grown accustom to it showering me. Switched gears but the cycle isnt making it easy. I was running, I was running on empty ideas, but I had to write them down just to listen. Im flying over the ocean and back. I breathe in, I breathe out. I breathe in, I breathe out. I breathe in.</segment9>
		<segment10>Get alone, when the others are blinding. Get alone, leave distraction behind me. Get alone, where the streets are defining. Get alone, theyre always there and reminding.</segment10>
		<segment11>Get alone, when the others are blinding. Get alone, leave distraction behind me. Get alone, where the streets are defining. Get alone, theyre always there and reminding.     </segment11>
