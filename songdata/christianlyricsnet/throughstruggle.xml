		<segment1>only through struggle have i found rest. with a piece of me taken away. i begin to understand. hollow out this machine like chest. with its gears that turn to make me feel. and assembled thoughts that fade away</segment1>
		<segment2>only through struggle have i found rest. only through struggle have i found rest</segment2>
		<segment3>remove from me. this deception that i called love</segment3>
		<segment4>with its gears that turn to make me feel. and assembled thoughts that fade away</segment4>
		<segment5>remove from me. this deception that i called love</segment5>
		<segment6>only through struggle have i found rest. with a piece of me taken away. i begin to understand. i begin to understand. i begin to understand    </segment6>
