		<segment1>I've seen it all come crashing down, without warning, without a sound, it's alright, it's ok, who'd have dreamed it's getting better, it's alright, it's ok, who'd have dreamed of such as this, it's not a thing we take lightly, there's not a day that we escape, what am I to say, what am I to do, everything to gain, everything to lose, what in the world are we supposed to do the world is on our shoulders, all that I know, is give it all to you, the signs of getting older, we will see in the end, I see it all, much clearer now, without a veil, without a cloud, we will see.. in the end    </segment1>
