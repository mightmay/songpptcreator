		<segment1>empting life. Won't come and beg for the last time. It's already ours we just came here to claim it. And we are not paying a dime. In the street you'll find us. Vulnerable but lit up like a cigarette. Celebrating thankxmas. Without a regret</segment1>
		<segment2>Can't buy this freedom. With another slogan. With another lie. Can't buy this freedom. With another gadget. Buy or die. What do you say, let's stay. And not run away. Can't buy this freedom. With another slogan. With another lie</segment2>
		<segment3>Tempting life. I feel like houseclimbing. Down the street. Newfound freedom. Making wings grow out of my feet. In these streets we live. In this streets we die. Fear is so expensive. And freedom is so free that it's hard to buy</segment3>
		<segment4>Can't buy this freedom. With another slogan. With another lie. Can't buy this freedom. With another gadget. Buy or die. What do you say, let's stay. And not run away. Can't buy this freedom. With another slogan. With another lie.     </segment4>
