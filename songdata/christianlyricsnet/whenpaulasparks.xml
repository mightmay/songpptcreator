		<segment1>Sleep now moon. I'll watch over her while the sun is up. and you'll have your eyes again soon. It's a glorious day and my lonely heart is tired again. and I am starved for her attention. That's when Paula sparks a little light in my eye. Sleep now sweet princess I'll cheer for you silently and carefully not to disturb. I'll be ready on that evening. when you're starved for my attention you'll say, &quot;wake now, prince; there's a brilliant sky above. and a jealous moon in love and they are starved for our attention.&quot;    </segment1>
