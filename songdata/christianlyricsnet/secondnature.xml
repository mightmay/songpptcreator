		<segment1>It's so typical. I'm always amazed. When it comes to You. Feels so natural. To be blown away. When I stop and think of. How your love is etched upon my heart. And how no matter. If I laugh, If I hope. If I dream You're a part of me</segment1>
		<segment2>Wanting You, needing You. Loving You comes to me. It comes like Second Nature like. Breathing in, breathing out. Something I don't think about. It comes like Second Nature. Second Nature</segment2>
		<segment3>Like an instinct. That I can't control. I always turn to You. It's a spiritual thing. A thirst in my soul. That makes me run. Into your arms and to the place. Our hears collide where everything comes clear. And I see, from the start. This is how love was meant to be</segment3>
		<segment4>It's so obvious. I was born for this. Born for a love like this. And I know for sure. I've been captured. There's no escaping this..    </segment4>
