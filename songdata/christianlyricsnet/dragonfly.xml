		<segment2>Hey, hey dragonfly. I'd like to stare into your big bug eyes. Get a closer look at your fine wings. Think about some fleeting, pretty things. Hey, hey, hey dragonfly </segment2>
		<segment3>Come a little closer, dragonfly. Little sapphire slipping through the sky. Between the skaters and the fishing lines. My, my, my dragonfly </segment3>
