		<segment1>I will show you love like youve never loved before. I will go the distance and back for more if you just say the word</segment1>
		<segment2>You will come alive again and call the trying times your friend. The pain that you have suffered through will never get the best of you. You will hope in something real that wont depend on how you feel. When you call my name then I will answer, answer</segment2>
		<segment3>I am on your side though the wind and waves beat against your faith. You were on my mind when the world was made. Trust in me my child, Trust in me my child</segment3>
		<segment4>Walk out on the water where you have no control. So scared to death of failure you sacrifice your soul, please let that go</segment4>
		<segment5>You have climbed an uphill road, You have worn a heavy load. You have cried through endless nights and nearly given up the fight. Watched your dreams like falling stars the heartaches made you who you are. Now looking back you see that I have always been there</segment5>
		<segment6>Where you gonna hide? Where you gonna hide from Me?. Where you gonna go? Where you gonna go that I cant see?</segment6>
		<segment7>I have heard you cry and it breaks my heart for I love you so. I would never lie, this is not the end there is still a hope    </segment7>
