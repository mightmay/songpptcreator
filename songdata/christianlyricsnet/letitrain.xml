		<segment1>fisher of men remembers.. </segment1>
		<segment2>and I have watched in wonder. as with a word You calmed a raging sea. I have seen You make the wine from water. mud and water made a blind man see. water still reminds me. of the seaside where our eyes first met </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. let it rain. Lord we're waiting for Your rain to fall. let it rain. bringing back the wonder of it all. and I can see Your face again. when You let it rain </segment3>
		<segment4>and I've been bathed in mercy. by every gesture, every word You've said. once I spoke of power and high position. you toke a towel and washed my feed instead. water, like a promise. heaven opens, but I'm not there yet </segment4>
		<segment5>- Chorus - </segment5>
		<segment6>I've been foolish. thought I know it all. three times I denied Your name. Your forgiveness, like a waterfall. washes away my shame </segment6>
		<segment7>a new dawn is breaking. another our, and the I leave this place. I am ready, Lord, to give my life up. I'm so ready, Lord, to see Your face. water, like a promise. and in this final hour, I think my final prayer shall be. would You let it rain?. let Your Spirit fall afresh on me </segment7>
		<segment8>- Chorus -.     </segment8>
