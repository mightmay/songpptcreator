		<segment1>Put on the armor you've got the sword. prepare to fight for you've got the final word. the power of darkness is pushing in. they call it fashion but it's known as sin. the Evil One knows all too well. gives you the world but you burn in hell. the Lord is with you for ever more. the power of God always wins the war</segment1>
		<segment2>bridge. He can give the power to make it through. He gives us the strength, He cares for you</segment2>
		<segment3>chorus twice. never surrender, never say die, never, never. Jesus won the battle for you and I. never surrender never say die, never, never. Jesus won the battle for you and I</segment3>
		<segment4>you've got the power don't be ashamed. you gotta stand up for the name of Jesus. can't be defeated he's breaking through. the power of God is coming down on you. a change is coming. it's in the air. stand up and shout He's coming back again. we've got the fire it's in our hearts. the hand of God will show you the way</segment4>
		<segment5>repeat bridge. repeat chorus. (lead guitar break). repeat chorus 5x.     </segment5>
