		<segment1>Summer sun has come to stay, Bikinis, tans, outrageous legs, They're all retarded, and they all look the same, And barbie's body's melting down, On her face a big fat frown, 'cause Mr. Cellulite just moved into town.</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Well me and B, we hate supermodels, It's not that we know anyone personally, It's just that I'm tired of being compared.</segment2>
		<segment3>The boys they come here, With expectations for the summer, I refuse to take any part of this barbaric ritual, 'cause God has given me a mind, That I will use from time to time, And I got more on my head, Than what's made by Paul Mitchell.</segment3>
		<segment4>(Repeat chorus). It's just that I'm tired of being compared.</segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge). Was it worth the tears you cried.. To fit the size?</segment5>
		<segment6>Well Think it over once or twice, What lasts the longest in this life, Character, or rock hard thighs?. In the end do you believe, That beauty lies in what you see?. 'cause if you do, then baby. YouÂ´ve been deceived.</segment6>
		<segment7>(Repeat chorus)    </segment7>
