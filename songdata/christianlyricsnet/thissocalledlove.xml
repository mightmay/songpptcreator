		<segment1>I can be there for you when it can't get much harder. I can cover your head when life starts to rain. I can hold on tight when you feel like you're falling. I can bread crumb the path when you've lost your way. I can make you laugh when the whole world is crying. I can build you up when you're broken in shame. But if all that we do is absent of Jesus, then this so called love is completely in vain..     </segment1>
