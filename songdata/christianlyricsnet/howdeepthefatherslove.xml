		<segment1>How deep the Father's love for us. How vast beyond all measure. That He should give His only Son. To make a wretch His treasure</segment1>
		<segment2>How great the pain of searing loss. The Father turns His face away. As wounds which mar the Chosen One. Bring many sons to glory</segment2>
		<segment3>Behold the man upon a cross. My sin upon His shoulders. Ashamed I hear my mocking voice. Call out among the scoffers</segment3>
		<segment4>It was my sin that held Him there. Until it was accomplished. His dying breath has brought me life. I know that it is finished</segment4>
		<segment5>I will not boast in anything. No gifts, no power, no wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus Christ. His death and resurrection</segment5>
		<segment6>Why should I gain from His reward. I cannot give an answer. But this I know with all my heart. His wounds have paid my ransom    </segment6>
