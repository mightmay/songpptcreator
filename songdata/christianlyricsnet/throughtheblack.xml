		<segment1>I've never been the type to turn my back and run. It's just never appealed to me to be the same as everyone. And when it comes to shove and I can't see you through the black, I'm going to scream your name till you come back. And every time I play with fire, I'm going to Burn, Burn, Burn until I learn. And everytime I do it myself, I'm going to hate, hate, hate. It's time to get it straight. I bury sick side, I tear from the inside out, I follow the downside, I'm waiting for something else. I know that you'll be here and I'll be waiting. I know that youll be near and I'll be waiting. I turn it back and question everything in site. It's like I try to fall again when everything is going right. And everything that matters isn't everything in site. It's taking every bit of me to keep this all inside. I've never been the type to turn my back and run. It's just never appealed to me to be the same as everyone. And when it comes to shove, and I can't see you through the black, I'm going to scream your name till you come back. I bury sick side, I tear from the inside out, I follow the downside, I'm waiting for something else. I know that you'll be here and I'll be waiting. I know that youll be near and I'll be waiting. Lost my mind and I've lost track, gonna scream your name till you come back. Scream your name, lost my mind. I know that you'll be here and I'll be waiting. I know that you'll be near and I'll be waiting. (lost my mind), I'll be waiting. I'll scream your name til you come back.    </segment1>
