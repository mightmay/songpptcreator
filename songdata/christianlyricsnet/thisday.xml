		<segment1>It's six A.M. I'm so tired. The alarm sounds. And the new day begins. Before I go. And disturb this peaceful moment. I look to You </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. I want to say a prayer. Before my feet can hit the ground. Lord I give this day to You </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm amazed how You forgive me. Yesterday seems so far behind. It's a brand new day. And every day's a new beginning. I look to You </segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS] </segment4>
		<segment5>Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathe in. And watch the day begin. I wanna watch the day begin </segment5>
		<segment6>[REPEAT CHORUS]    </segment6>
