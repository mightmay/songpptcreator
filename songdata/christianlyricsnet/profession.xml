		<segment1>In.. in this life theres so much distraction it seems to consume my mind. All the time that Ive spent on nothing, it could make an endless line.</segment1>
		<segment2>The shortness of our time in this life should cause an urgency, a passion for what lasts. Eternity is the line that we must cast.. cast.</segment2>
		<segment3>This is the line our hearts blood must sign.. This is the line our hearts blood must sign.. to be completely sold out, to firmly plant our feet, to stand, to never compromise our stance and lift the weak when they cant stand.. stand.</segment3>
		<segment4>This song is my profession. These words you hear are mine. This life is not my own life. This is my hearts resign.. resign.</segment4>
		<segment5>This is my hearts resign. This is my hearts resign. This is my hearts resign. This is my hearts resign.    </segment5>
