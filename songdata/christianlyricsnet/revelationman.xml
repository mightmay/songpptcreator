		<segment1>There's a man who seems just like a savior. With everyone he meets he gains their favor. Oh, with every move he makes, Another hand he shakes. Odds are he won't give you peace tomorrow</segment1>
		<segment2>Revelation Man. Revelation Man. Hey, he's givin' you a number and takin' away your faith</segment2>
		<segment3>It's there in Revelation that you find. A pretty beast who has an evil mind. He led the world astray;. They'll give their souls away. All that he will give is grief and sorrow</segment3>
		<segment4>Revelation Man. Revelation Man. Hey, he's givin' you a number and takin' away your faith</segment4>
		<segment5>Bringin' all the world together one day. Then saying that he's God Almighty next day. Oh, but you fell for all his tricks. By listenin' to 666. God's not who he is you'll see tomorrow</segment5>
		<segment6>Revelation Man. Revelation Man. Hey, he's givin' you a number and takin' away your faith</segment6>
		<segment7>Revelation Man.     </segment7>
