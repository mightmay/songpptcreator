		<segment1>I sit around. Waiting for the world. To come and let me down. And when I've come undone. You meet me where I am. But I cannot pretend. That everything makes sense</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Help me get my feet back off the ground. All this thinking is killing me. Or am I just afraid to be. Help me to come back around. Either way now I'm not looking down</segment2>
		<segment3>Underneath. Your sunny sky. I fly and I am floored by You, by You. Every breath you breathe. Has got me feeling free. I'm free indeed. Now everything makes sense</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Either way, I'm not looking down.     </segment5>
