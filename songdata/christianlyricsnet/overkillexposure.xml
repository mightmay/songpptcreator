		<segment1>I watched them murder and kill / Plot against the destroyed will. I watched a man ripped to shreds / Stench of rot does not offend. Create a theme, sell it how / Promiscuous, no consequence. Think of ways to shock us now / Good luck, IÂ’ve seen it all</segment1>
		<segment2>I will pay for this death and destruction / Just to know such things exist. I will pay for this death and destruction / Knowledge of evil paralysis. Overkill exposure</segment2>
		<segment3>Cannibalistic destruction / Fanatical debauchery / Glorified infidelity. Show me death, show me lies / Show me unthinkable darkness. Programmed perversion of the worst kind</segment3>
		<segment4>Show me death, show me lies / Show me unthinkable darkness. Show me death, show me lies </segment4>
		<segment5>I will pay for this death and destruction / Just to know such things exist. I will pay for this death and destruction / Knowledge of evil paralysis. Overkill exposure</segment5>

		<segment7>Guard my heart, guard my will / Think of ways to shock us now. Guard my heart, guard my will / Keep your death and lies    </segment7>
