		<segment1>[Talking:] We gon fight [2x]</segment1>
		<segment2>[4x Chorus:]. I'm fighting temptations [2x]. I'm fighting fighting [2x]</segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse 1:]. Ahh, I'm trying to live a godly life. Be lying if i said it ain't hard. I can't even open my eyes. Cuz everything is Rated R. Can't believe what I'm seeing, I'm speechless. All i see is your booty and cleavage. You just tryin to find my weakness. I'm determined to pass your test </segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus: 4x]</segment4>
		<segment5>[Verse 2:]. Ahh, Tryin to be spirit lit. I ain't gon let you in my head. And like a spider you are weaving your web. Tryin to get a brotha in your bed. You don't like it, that I'm standing tall. Though the reason why faith didn't fall. So put away your seduced lips. I know the devil's all in your kiss </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus: 4x]</segment6>
		<segment7>[Verse 3:]. Ahh, under pressure to make this money. This recession makin things so hard. I don't wanna do nothing illegal. Then i gotta put my trust in god. Lord, I'm reaching out for help. I can't win the war by myself. Lord, I need a little more patience. And more strength so I can fight temptations.     </segment7>
