		<segment1>I will worship with all of my heart. I will praise You with all my strength. I will seek You all of my days. And I will follow all of Your ways. Chorus: I will give You all my worship. I will give You all my praise. You alone I long to worship. You alone are worthy of my praise. I will bow down and hail You as King. I will serve You, I'll give You everything. I will lift up my eyes to Your throne. I will trust You, I will trust You alone. I will worship, I will bow down. I will give You all my praise. &lt;small&gt; 1991 Shade Tree Publishing/Marnatha Praise Inc.&lt;/small&gt;    </segment1>
