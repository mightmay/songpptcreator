		<segment1>Quiet..Warm..Unable to speak a single word. These white walls are taking me. Saying the words we mean to no one. It's the best way to kill the adolescent. Familiar, restless, bleeding, constant. I've given my eyes away to darkness. and locked all the entrances while visions of angels dance in my mind. This world is a thief to our eyes. This world is a theif in disguise. If sight is lacking, take mine. If sight is lacking, take my eyes. I can hear them calling. I can see them reaching out. They're speaking my name. They're pleading with my heart. I can hear them calling. I can see them reaching out. They're speaking my name. They're pleading with my heart. These white walls are taking me. These white walls are taking.    </segment1>
