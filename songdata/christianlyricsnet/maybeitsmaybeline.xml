		<segment1>People make mistakes. we find that everything breaks. and it always is the same, gotta find someone to blame. and these errors that we make (cause we're all human earthquakes). yeah, we made the hurricane, yet we're not the one's to blame?</segment1>
		<segment2>we point the finger even though it's not polite. we condemn the son of God (we're hoping two wrongs make a right). maybe it is them. or, maybe it is me. or, maybe it's maybeline</segment2>
		<segment3>people make mistakes. we took the apple from the snake. and it always is the same: gotta find someone to blame. our reputations were at stake, but the guilt we could not take. America's gone done the drain. the president's fault again?</segment3>
		<segment4>we point the finger even though it's not polite. we condemn the son of God (we're hoping two wrongs make a right). maybe it is them. or, maybe it is me. or, maybe it's maybeline</segment4>
		<segment5>the truth is, excuses are lame. accept consequence. accept the blame. we're all sinners. we're all unclean. maybe we're born with it. or maybe it's maybeline    </segment5>
