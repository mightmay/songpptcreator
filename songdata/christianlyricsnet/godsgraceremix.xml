		<segment1>Everything you need is right here. All of your problems, yes I'm aware. And when you're down, I'll be right there. You can call on Me cause. I'll hear your prayer. No other name can bring joy when there is pain. He'll do it for you but first you gotta know it's by grace. Chorus: It's by God's grace. All things through Christ Jesus. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. I'm so glad to know (so glad). It's by God's grace. All things through Christ Jesus. No weapon formed against me shall prosper </segment1>
		<segment2>Say you got laid off. Can't pay your bills. Sick, can't get well. My Jesus heals. He'll brighten up your darkest day. Put trust in Him. And he'll make a way. Anyone the son sets free - is free indeed. He'll set you free. But first you got to be a believer and know that it's by God. It's by God's grace. All things through Christ Jesus. No weapon formed against me shall prosper. Come on in before the sun goes down. Even though the devil's got you down. Though you're tired of going round and round. Take the Word and knock him down. He'll forgive you of your sin. Open up and let Him in. Let the Lord show you His love. We are more than conquerors     </segment2>
