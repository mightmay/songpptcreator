		<segment1>Pin it all on me He said as He turned His head to the sun. I'm the only one who can wash it all away. Take a look at yourself. Do you know when things aren't right?. Are you willing to stand up and fight. For what you say you're believing in?</segment1>
		<segment2>We all are human we make mistakes but. We were given a choice to make</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: What do you live for? / Is it something to stand for?. Is it everything that you believe and more?. A reason to give more / Finally you found yours. And it's everything that you believe and more</segment3>
		<segment4>And as I look around. It's impossible to deny. Even though sometimes I try. You still take me back again</segment4>
		<segment5>My God I've finally found a friend to. Follow to the end</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>What do you live for?. Is it something to stand for?. Is it everything and more</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS</segment8>
		<segment9>You're what I live for / You're what I stand for. And You're everything that I believe and more. My reason to give more / Finally I found You. And You're everything that I believe and more     </segment9>
