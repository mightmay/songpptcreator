		<segment1>Just take those old directions off the shelf. I'm sending us into the Bible Belt. To take you the way God can save souls. I'll ride that old time Romans Road. Don't try to take me to a different road. You'll never even get me -- I'll never go. But take me on the highway straight for the Lord. I like that old time Romans Road. I like that old time Romans Road. That avenue it just saves your soul. I rev my engines down the streets of gold. With that old time Romans Road. Although I hear the way is narrow. All other avenues are bumpy old roads. There's only one sure way to get me to God. That way's the old time Romans Road. CHORUS. Romans 3:23 is what you read. Then find verse 5:8 then verse 6:23. Then take Romans 10:9 to save your soul. And thatÂ’s the old time Romans Road. CHORUS. I like that old time Romans Road. That avenue it just saves your soul. I read a missive 'bout the faith of old. It's that old time Romans Road.     </segment1>
