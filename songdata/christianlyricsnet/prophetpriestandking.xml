		<segment1>put down my thoughts in a letter to the president. penciled and packaged with all due respect. elvis commemoratives just for effect. never heard back: you think you know a guy</segment1>
		<segment2>wired my congrats to chuck and di some time ago. all my love to the queen. my invitation was lost in the mail. but i know i was missed. when they kissed 'neath the veil. i sent a nice gift; never got a note</segment2>
		<segment3>but my closet's a shrine to and old friend of mine. here i talk all the time with a prophet priest.. i pull out boxes and brooms. and i gush like a groom. for it's here i commune with. a prophet, priest and king</segment3>
		<segment4>if i indeed am misperceived. by some heads of state. hey, that's great. 'cause i talk to a prophet who tells me the truth. and i dine with a king at my home in duluth. better yet i'm in touch with a much needed friend. who hears my confessions and pardons my sin.    </segment4>
