		<segment1>I am high above the timberline. Where the sky and mountains meet. Up where the air is very thin. Somehow it's easier to breathe</segment1>
		<segment2>Like the wind in the canyon echoing. The spirit is calling me, whispering</segment2>
		<segment3>Out here, in the wild and the wonder. Where the lightning and the thunder. Serve a great awakening</segment3>
		<segment4>Out here, where the one who did the making. Is still in me creating, a place where I am free. I can hear, I can breathe, I believe, out here</segment4>
		<segment5>I am knee deep in the chaos. Of another crazy day. It's me and all the other rats. Just trying to stay in the race</segment5>
		<segment6>I close my eyes and I try listening. And I find the spirit is still calling me</segment6>
		<segment7>Out here, in the wild and the wonder. Where the lightning and the thunder. Serve a great awakening</segment7>
		<segment8>Out here, where the one who did the making. Is still in me creating, a place where I am free. I can hear, I can breathe, I believe, out here</segment8>
		<segment9>Out here, in the wild and the wonder. Where the lightning and the thunder. Bring a great awakening</segment9>
		<segment10>Out here, where the one who did the making. Is still in me creating, a place where I am free. I can hear, I can breathe, I believe</segment10>
		<segment11>Out here, here, here, here, here    </segment11>
