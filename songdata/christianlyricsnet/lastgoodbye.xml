		<segment1>I don't ever want to have to see you go. Cause I don't ever want to have to be alone. Little did I know I wasn't on my own. This is the only way I've found for me to show. Exactly how I feel as you go</segment1>
		<segment2>I will never say, never say die. Forever and ever, I'll try. Got to get it right just between you and I. This could be the last goodbye. And I know that I will never, ever find. Another one-of-a-kind love redefined. Hold on tight to the one that lights your eyes. Cause every single day, we're running out of time. So I have got to find a way to show you how I feel</segment2>
		<segment3>Got to get it right. Could this be, could this be the last goodbye?.     </segment3>
