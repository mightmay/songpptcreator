		<segment1>Good week I've got. Gonna see him once again. Been working out, reading up. Be all smart and slim. Who'd knew I'd be this anxious. Who'd have guessed this horrid fate?. All I know is I. Have to be perfect by Thursday. Perfect by Thursday</segment1>
		<segment2>I rarely get to see him. And his name is all I know. He smiles like a king. And that's all he'd dare to show. I'm faithfully attending. My motive almost pure. Reckless in my thinking. But it's his that I'm not sure</segment2>
		<segment3>Perfect by Thursday. I'm planning the evening. I know what I'm wearing. And what I'll be singing. Perfect by Thursday</segment3>
		<segment4>One day left. And it's not looking very good. I haven't seen much progress. To perfection like I should. But now I cannot quit. Because today could be the day. That all the effort. All the work decides to finally pay.</segment4>
		<segment5>And then you will fall in love. I smile when you walk by. I laugh even louder. You don't even bother</segment5>
		<segment6>I hold every memory. As sweet as a lemon. As loose as a fire</segment6>
		<segment7>So now he's on the TV screen. He's catching for some man. Moved away and left me here. I don't understand. But I'm convinced that he'll be back. When I do least expect. Despite my opposition. I fear that I am correct</segment7>
		<segment8>Perfect by Thursday. I'm sprinting to make it. If I have to fake it. You know I can take it    </segment8>
