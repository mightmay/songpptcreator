		<segment1>Wait, wait, wait, theres somethin that I gotta say. Itll take, take, take, just a minute so dont walk away. I search in circles for a remedy. To fight the poison that is killing me. Its like Im falling fast head over feet. Is anybody listening?</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna believe. I wanna believe in love again. I wanna believe. I wanna believe in love again. Tired of living this way, tired of everyday. So will you help me. I wanna breakthrough. I wanna believe in you </segment2>
		<segment3>Hey, hey, hey, why is everyday the same for me?. Fake, fake, fake, just pretend what Im suppose to be. I need an answer for my remedy. I need a Savior cause Im in too deep. I reach up, I reach up. Will You reach down here to me?</segment3>
		<segment4>You found me, found me, You were looking for me. You found me, found me, You were looking for me. You found me, You were waiting for me. I can see Your love. You found me, You were waiting for me. I can see Your love</segment4>
		<segment5>I believe in You, I believe in You, I believe in You. I believe in You, I believe in You, I believe in You    </segment5>
