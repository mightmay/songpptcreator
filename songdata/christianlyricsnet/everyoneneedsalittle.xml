		<segment1>Come all ye weary and ye broken. Come to the table of the Lord. Come sing the song of the forgiven. Come lay your burden on the Word</segment1>
		<segment2>Come and find. Peace everyone needs a little. Rest everyone needs a little. Joy and a song to sing in the darkest night. Life even when it gets you down. Hope will turn it all around. But love is the greatest of these. Everyone needs a little</segment2>
		<segment3>Sing all ye saints and ye sinners. Call upon the mercy of the Lord. Come sing the song of redemption. Sing about the hope that is to come</segment3>
		<segment4>He will lift you up. He will lift you up higher than sorrow. He will lift you up. And cover your soul with healing    </segment4>
