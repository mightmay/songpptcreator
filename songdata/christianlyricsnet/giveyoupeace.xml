		<segment1>V1. I see you lying their whispering prayers. I hear you breathing out hollowed be thy name. Holding out my hand catching every tear. Oh my child I'll never leave your side</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. I will give you peace when the walls come crashing down. I will give you peace through the night. When you've had all you can take can't face another day. I'll give you peace, I'll give you peace</segment2>
		<segment3>V2. For such a time as this I have you here. Chosen for the lost to show I'm near. Through your brokenness my glory shines. And through your frailty my strength will rise</segment3>
		<segment4>REPEAT CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE. Your beautiful, your beautiful. Perfect in my sight. Righteousness adorns you my bride. Your beautiful, so beautiful    </segment5>
