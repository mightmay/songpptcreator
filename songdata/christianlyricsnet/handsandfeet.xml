		<segment1>An image flashed across my TV screen. Another broken heart comes into view. I saw the pain and I turned my back. Why can't I do the things I want to?. I'm willing, yet I'm so afraid. You give me strength. When I say</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I want to be your hands. I want to be your feet. I'll go where you send me. I'll go where you send me. I want to be your hands. I want to be your feet. I'll go where you send me. I'll go where you send me</segment2>
		<segment3>And I try, yeah I try. To touch the world like. You touched my life. And I find my way. To be your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>I've abandoned every selfish thought. I've surrendered every thing I've got. You can have everything I am. And perfect everything I'm not. I'm willing, I'm not afraid. You give me strength. When I say</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>And I try, yeah I try. To touch the world like. You touched my life. And I find my way</segment6>
		<segment7>This is the lifetime I turned my back on you. From now on, I'll go so. Send me where You want me to. I finally have a mission. I promise I'll complete. I don't need excuses. When I am your hands and feet. I am Your hands and feet</segment7>
		<segment8>Hands.. Feet.. go.. go..</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus x2</segment9>
		<segment10>I will go where you send me    </segment10>
