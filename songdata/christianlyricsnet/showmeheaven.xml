		<segment1>Here, I am not alone. There is nowhere I can run to, On my own. Here, never from your sight. Lighten up my darkest hour, Shine Your light. You make me wait, You make me wait.</segment1>
		<segment2>Show me heaven. Show me heaven.</segment2>
		<segment3>Here, I am not afraid. There is somewhere I can run to. Here, my dear shining bright. No more shadows fall around me. It's worth the wait, No it's not too late.</segment3>
		<segment4>Show me. Show me. Heavens what I'm living for. Show me. Show me. Heaven can I wait no more?. Show me. Show me what to sing. Loving You's the only thing.     </segment4>
