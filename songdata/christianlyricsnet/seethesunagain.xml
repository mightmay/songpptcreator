		<segment1>Never imagined that you'd be here again. Yet another season of doubt has set in. The warm september rains have gone, gone away. The trust that you held in your heart isn't there. Now you're fighting your fears but they never fight fair. Gone are all the endless summer days</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I believe that they're still there. Though the storms will surely. So let me ask you can you look to the sky. And strain to see the sun again</segment2>
		<segment3>You harbor the hurt and you shelter the pain. Too proud to confess that you'd fallen again. But don't you long for mercy's tender embrace. Remember the works you spoke from your heart. It's a pity those phrases have fallen apart. Gone is every promise that you made</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Will you keep fooling yourself. How long will you run till you're gasping for air. You ran when the shadows grew long. You thought the sun fell from the sky. But i tell you you're wrong.     </segment5>
