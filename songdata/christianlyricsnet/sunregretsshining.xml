		<segment1>so different when. across the lake. blue green eyed hour. caught us in the wake. i hope she feels the. way that i do. i rippled when. to me she spoke. and rode the wave. even as it broke. i'm riding still. i hope forever. the sun will regret shining. i won't forget. but will you?. do you believe in us still. can we see this thing through?. arrest my fears. and be content. its taken years. but its time well spent. and it means more than you imagine. long way to go. before we're done. and you should know. more than anyone. that i am always thinking of you. and there's time for answers. right or wrong. thanks for standing by me. for so long    </segment1>
