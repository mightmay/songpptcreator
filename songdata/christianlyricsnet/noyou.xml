		<segment1>Feelin' so crazy lately. When it seems that You're not around. The sun and the moon shine bright. But my eyes are all Yours now. Don't know how I lived with out You. I don't remember how it used to feel. Lord, I can't imagine if I had no You to hold me</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Where would I go with no You to run to. No You to hold me when I am afraid?. Who would I be with no You beside me?. I oughta know it by now without You there's no me. Ohhh, there's no me</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, when I need You, You're always here. To play through the laughter, love through the tears. And when my heart seems so far away. Into Your arms is where I wanna stay. I try to find the words to tell You. All the things my heart's been telling me. I don't wanna know how it feels to have no You to love me</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Where would I go with no You to run to?. No You to hold me when I am afraid?. Where would I be with no You beside me?. I oughtta know it by now without you..</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
