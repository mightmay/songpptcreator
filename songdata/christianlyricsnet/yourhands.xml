		<segment1>I have unanswered prayers. I have trouble I wish wasnÂ’t there. And I have asked a thousand ways. That you would take my pain away. You would take my pain away</segment1>
		<segment2>I am trying to understand. How to walk this weary land. Make straight the paths that crooked lie. Oh Lord, before these feet of mine. Oh Lord, before these feet of mine</segment2>
		<segment3>When my world is shaking, heaven stands. When my heart is breaking. I never leave your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>When you walked upon the earth. You healed the broken, lost and hurt. I know you hate to see me cry. One day you will set all things right. Yeah, one day you will set all things right</segment4>
		<segment5>When my world is shaking, heaven stands. When my heart is breaking. I never leave your hands</segment5>
		<segment6>Your hands that shaped the world. Are holding me. They hold me still.     </segment6>
