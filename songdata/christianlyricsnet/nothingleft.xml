		<segment1>This world was never worthy. But how can I call it unfaithful. Every promise was fulfilled. As decay crawled from it's throat. Like the dead rising from an open grave. Lips of splendor and tongue of deceit. All dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste</segment1>
		<segment2>Like those gasping for their last breath. We cannot hide there's nothing left</segment2>
		<segment3>If All my sorrow has led me here. Then I would cry all of my tears. To have this chance again. And know there's more than this. And know there's more than you</segment3>
		<segment4>Like those gasping for their last breath. We cannot hide there's nothing left    </segment4>
