		<segment1>Crash boom bang and kill the lies. sniffin clue smokin dope and gettin high. you's been doin this for years. blood for the tears. you switched from one to some higher gears. all these dope games made u wanna scream. you picked up all the pieces of this empty dream. cuz you's been puttin it down for the wrong god. and now you's dyin and cryin for some real love. and in the meanwhile I was doin fine. lettin the love and pease trully shine. I don't wanna be there when you come to it. ain't it your own shue but does it really fit. so wipe the tears from your lonely eyes. leave the fears try to realise. look up see the first price. he who's in me is greater than the lord of the lies</segment1>
		<segment2>he who's in me is greater</segment2>
		<segment3>every battle has been all ready won. you just gotta choose the side you're on. the world's a machine god is tha masta. I wanna serve him not cuz I has to. but cuz I want to do the will of god. live my whole life filled wit love. swim against the flow, eat meat and grow. and fight all the battles like a real pro. so if I didn't come accross all clear and loud. I'll tell you again he's real no doubt. he changed my whole life and I thank hi. i no longer have to take it in the chin. so won't you too try to visualize. this world will never hear ya cries. but heaven you'll resieve the first price. he who's in me is greater than the lord of flies    </segment3>
