		<segment1>He gets his information from overhearing conversations. He doesn't ask questions, Doesn't learns many lessons. And he keeps his mouth shut. Til it boils over and he blows up. And then he can't form his words right, They don't fit together so tight. And I hope to God that he will find his name, And not listen to his so-called friends when they so boldly say,</segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;This is the way that you are,&quot;. Don't let them say, &quot;This is the way that you are.&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>She doesn't have much to say about yesterday, Or what happened to her when she was eight. So she drinks a lot and it makes her feel okay for the moment, But it's gone when she awakes. And I hope you know that someone out there loves you. So don't give yourself away, And don't listen to them when they say</segment3>
		<segment4>&quot;This is the way that you are,&quot;. Don't let them say, &quot;This is the way that you are.&quot;     </segment4>
