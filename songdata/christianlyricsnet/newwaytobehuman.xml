		<segment1>Everyday it's the same thing; another trend has begun. Hey kids, this might be the one. It's a race to be noticed and it's leaving us numb. Hey kids, we can't be the ones </segment1>
		<segment2>With all of our fashion we're still incomplete. The God of redemption could break our routine </segment2>
		<segment3>There's a new way to be human. It's nothing we've ever been. There's a new way to be human. New way to be human </segment3>
		<segment4>And where is our inspiration when all the heroes are gone?. Hey kids, could we be the ones? </segment4>
		<segment5>'Cause nobody's famous and nobody's fine. We all need forgiveness; we're longing inside </segment5>
		<segment6>There's a new way to be human. It's nothing we've ever been. There's a new way to be human. It's spreading under my skin. There's a new way to be human. Where divinity blends. With a new way to be human. New way to be human </segment6>
		<segment7>You're throwing your love across my impossible space. You have created me. Take me out of me into a new way to be human. To a new way to be human </segment7>
		<segment8>You're a new way to be human. Where my humanity bends. To a new way to be human. Redemption begins </segment8>
		<segment9>You're a new way to be human. You're a new way to be human. You're the only way to be human. You're a new way to be human.     </segment9>
