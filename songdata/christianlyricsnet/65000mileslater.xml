		<segment1>Thinking back on summer weekends. Hanging out no need for reasons. I recall spot drive-in meetings. 3 a.m. and still we're eating</segment1>
		<segment2>I make this promise and I'll keep it. Never will my friends I forfeit. To all the ones who feel forgotten. Keep holding on to these words just said</segment2>
		<segment3>I understand and I don't blame you. I've been gone and you've been gone too. Different place, so many places. Growing up just seems to haveve changed things</segment3>
		<segment4>I make this promise and I'll keep it. Never will my friends I forfeit. To all the ones who feel forgotten. Keep holding on to these words just said</segment4>
		<segment5>I make this promise and I'll keep it. Never will my friends I forfeit. To all the ones who feel forgotten. Keep holding on to these words just said</segment5>
		<segment6>This promise and I'll keep it. Never will my, never will my. Never will my friends I forfeit    </segment6>
