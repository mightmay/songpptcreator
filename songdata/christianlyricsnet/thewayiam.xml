		<segment1>Blind these eyes who never tried. To lose temptation. I'm so scared, where's the hesitation?. You so easily proved that You could save a man. I am that man </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS </segment2>
		<segment3>It's better off this way. To be deaf, dumb and lame. Than to be the way I am, I am. It's better off this way. Than be groping for the flame. Than to be the way I am, I am. Still this tongue for I am hung. By this wicked notion. Tame the beast, release. The noose I've woven. O, wasted tears dripping from my tongue. Well I'm hung, hung </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS </segment4>
		<segment5>Crooked path you never asked. You just left me there. And I deal with the aftermath. And you don't even care. O, crooked feet you nimbly meet the place of my fears </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS </segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
