		<segment1>Sweet are the branches growing the fruit that comes from the vine. But these are just branches blown by the wind holding on to life. I want to be like them holding to the One whose life is mine. And I know as I follow Him His life will sure show in me</segment1>
		<segment2>He said you will. Show yourselves to be the ones who follow Me. By the evidence you leave along the way. They'll know that you are Mine like the branches on the vine. If you show yourselves to be following Me</segment2>
		<segment3>Faith joins our hearts to Him, it's not a result of anything we do. But if we are part of Him, there will be reasons to believe it's true. The fruit cannot help but grow if the branch is joined into the tree. And love cannot help but show in the one who goes where Jesus leads</segment3>
		<segment4>He said you will. Show yourselves to be the ones who follow Me. By the evidence you leave along the way. They'll know that you are Mine like the branches on the vine. If you show yourselves to be following Me</segment4>
		<segment5>Planted in the fertile soil of quiet times. Watered by the rains of trouble, growing toward the sun that shines. They'll know that you are Mine like the branches on the vine. If you show yourselves to be following Me </segment5>
