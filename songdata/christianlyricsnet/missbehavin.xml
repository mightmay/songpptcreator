		<segment1>No! She won't, she won't, she won't wait!. No! She won't, she won't, she won't wait!. No! She won't, she won't, she won't wait!. No! She won't, she won't, she won't!</segment1>
		<segment2>Always what you meant, never what you said. Passing over me like a book you've read. But I let it fall, balling every wish. Take my hands and eyes, but I beg you this: Offer me one wish.</segment2>
		<segment3>If it's her you want, this is what it takes.. If it's her you want, this is what it takes..</segment3>
		<segment4>Let's get this over. (Let's get this over.). Discuss and deny something; simply just lie. (Let's get this over.). And wait and see if she's something like me. If you just open your eyes, you could get out of this, But your such a success, you're just not built for it.</segment4>
		<segment5>I never knew how much it takes to accept.. I never knew how much it takes. To accept that you're a fake.</segment5>
		<segment6>If you just open your eyes, you could get out of this, (If you just open your eyes..). But your such a success, you're just not built for it. (If you just open your eyes..)</segment6>
		<segment7>Sometimes I think you just need some time. Sometimes I think you just need some time. Sometimes I think I need some to get along without. To get along without..</segment7>
		<segment8>(To get along without.). Everyone's saying that they've got the answers. (To get along without..). Well hoping's deceiving, it spreads like a cancer.</segment8>
		<segment9>To get along without..     </segment9>
