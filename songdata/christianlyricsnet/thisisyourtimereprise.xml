		<segment1>It was a test we could all hope to pass. But none of us would want to take. Faced with the choice to deny God to live, For her, there was one choice to make.</segment1>
		<segment2>This was her time. this was her dance. She lived every moment; left nothing to chance. She swam in the sea; drank of the deep;. Embraced the mystery of all she could be.</segment2>
		<segment3>This was her time..</segment3>
		<segment4>Though you are mourning and grieving with us, Death died a long time ago;. Swallowed in life so that life carries on. Still it's so hard to let go.</segment4>
		<segment5>This was her time. this was her dance. She lived every moment; left nothing to chance. She swam in the sea; drank of the deep;. Embraced the mystery of all she could be.</segment5>
		<segment6>What if tomorrow, and what if today, Faced with the question, Oh what would you say?</segment6>
		<segment7>This is your time. this is your dance. Live every moment. leave nothing to chance. Swim in the sea. drink of the deep. Follow the mercy and hear yourself praying.</segment7>
		<segment8>Won't you save me?. Won't you save me?</segment8>
		<segment9>This is your time. this is your dance. Live every moment. leave nothing to chance. Swim in the sea. drink of the deep. Embrace the mystery of all you can be.</segment9>
		<segment10>This is your time. this is your dance. Live every moment. leave nothing to chance. Swim in the sea. drink of the deep. Embrace the mystery of all you can be.</segment10>
		<segment11>This is your time.. (won't you save me? ). (this is your time). (won't you save me? )    </segment11>
