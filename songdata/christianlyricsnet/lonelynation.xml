		<segment1>She turns like the ocean. She tells no emotion. She's been gunning down the fight. She's just reminiscing. Blood sweat and one things missing. She's been breaking up inside, inside</segment1>
		<segment2>Singing without tongues. Screaming without lungs. I want more than my lonely nation. I want more than my lonely nation. Desperate we are young, seperate we are one. I want more than my desperation. I want more than my lonely nation</segment2>
		<segment3>We are the target market, we set the corporate target. We are slaves of what we want. We're just not amused and, we're just used to bad news. We are slaves of what we want</segment3>
		<segment4>Singing without tongues. Screaming without lungs. I want more than my lonely nation. I want more than my lonely nation. Desperate we are young. Seperate we are one. I want more than my desperation. I want more than my lonely nation</segment4>
		<segment5>Lonely. Lonely</segment5>
		<segment6>Don't leave me. I'm tired. Don't leave me. I'm tired of feeling low. I'm feeling low. I'm feeling low!</segment6>
		<segment7>Singing without tongues. Screaming without lungs. I want more than my desperation nation. I want more than my lonely nation. Desperate we are young, seperate we are one. I want more than my lonely nation. I want more than my lonely nation. I want more than my lonely nation. I want more than my lonely nation    </segment7>
