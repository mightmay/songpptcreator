		<segment1>How long until I find the strength, to lift this lovers curse. Cause in my head it's surfaced, but otherwise unearthed. And superstitions got me thinking when will it all end. I wish this curse on no one. Chorus: When she walks inside my world you'll know it. Call me crazy if I try, your probably right. When she walks inside my world you'll know it. Call me crazy if I try, cause I know your right. When she walks inside</segment1>
		<segment2>I wait until I find the strength to break this lovers curse. Cause in my head it's ruptured but clearly never burst. And you won't find my cure anytime soon. So let these days be numbered</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus x 2: When she walks inside my world you'll know it. Call me crazy if I try, your probably right. When she walks inside my world you'll know it. Call me crazy if I try, cause I know your right. When she walks inside</segment3>
		<segment4>x 3. How long until I find the strength to lift this lovers curse. Cause in my head it's surfaced, in my head it's surfaced</segment4>
		<segment5>x 4. Then she walks inside    </segment5>
