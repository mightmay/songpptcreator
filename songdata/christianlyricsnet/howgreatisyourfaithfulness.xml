		<segment1>Now unto the King who reigns over all. And never changes or turns. Unfailing justice, unfading grace. Whose promises remain. Yes, Your promises remain</segment1>
		<segment2>The heavens ring. The saints all sing. &quot;Great is Your faithfulness&quot;. From age to age. We will proclaim. &quot;Great is Your faithfulness. How great is Your faithfulness&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>Everything changes, but You stay the same. Your word and kingdom endure. We lean on the promise of all that You are. And trust forevermore. We will trust forevermore</segment3>
		<segment4>From generation to generation. You never fail us, O God. Yesterday and today and tomorrow. Until the day You return     </segment4>
