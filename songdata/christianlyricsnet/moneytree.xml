		<segment1>4 more years ain't right for me, I don't think so. Won't let them teach me how to be a money tree. That's what you are. That's all you'll ever be. A money tree. They've got you planted in the ground, you don't know it. They make you put your money down &amp; they take it. Never want to be your money tree    </segment1>
