		<segment1>Center of attention night and day. I just hang on every word You say. With worlds revolving 'round You silently. How come You have all this time for me?</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cos You spend all day inside my brain. I'm overcome - hard to explain. So what am I supposed to do?. I must have You</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Be All End All. Start me finish me</segment3>
		<segment4>You've been walking down my street again. Now everybody wants to be my friend. Beginning and the end of everything. You're the only song I want to sing</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm absolutly in pursuit. Of something absolutly true. And all around has come undone: You're the 1*0*1</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
