		<segment1>Echoing, your words are life to me. Angels sing cause. you are everything but. I'm always about the thrill. It's always about the craze. I'm always about the thrill </segment1>
		<segment2>You will be my only hope. And I won't walk away. And we will see, we will see. You will be my only hope. And I won't walk away. And we will see, we will see you. My hope on saturday. Was crushed by all your crying!. (I'm afraid the sun is shining. But I see a hand that's writing) </segment2>
		<segment3>Screaming, weeping, gasping for you. Yahweh, I will follow you. and yet it seems. I'm always about the thrill. It's always about the craze. I'm always about the thrill    </segment3>
