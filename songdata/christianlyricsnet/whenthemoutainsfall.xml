		<segment1>You stand on the edge. You followed the call. No turning back you are risking it all. He whispers your name. In a moment of truth. The rocks fall around you. The ground starts to move. You step out on faith. It's all that you know. You jump into darkness and hold onto hope</segment1>
		<segment2>When the mountains fall. When the rivers rise. Security crumbles before your eyes. The one thing you know. In faith you'll find. Something to stand on or you will be taught to fly</segment2>
		<segment3>So dream your dreams. And live your life. Knowing there's more than to merely survive. Don't give up, don't give in. Fight through the rain and lean into the wind. 'Til you come to the edge of all that you know. Run right through the dark knowing you're not alone</segment3>
		<segment4>When you walk through the fire. It will not consume you. Though the water will rise. It won't overtake you. Though the mountains will fall. Oh, still I am with you. I've called you by name. And I will not leave you. I'm learning to trust you. I'm learning to fly. I'm learning to trust you. I'm learning to fly    </segment4>
