		<segment1>Verse 1: It goes something like this. You live your live making a fist. You swing every time, but you always miss. Do what you want, take your own advice. But you make your own bed as you handle the dice. You see, The odds are against you now. Your feet are so tired but your knees won't bow. Looking for the thing that I know you're missin'. I shout it out loud, but you just won't listen. Your eyes shut tight when I talk to you. Why don't you open up and enjoy the view. You can run, you can hide, you can live in a lie. But I won't give up on you till the day I die </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You're blinded by the Light. You can see the Light. Do you want the Light. You can have the Light</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: The story unfolds. You don't want to break the mold. Live a normal life, but you rape the soul. Your mind is fine, but your heart is bleeding. And you can't see the blood cause your minds deceiving. Living in the dark you embrace the fear. The message is clear, but you will not hear. Scared to believe what you cannot see. You keep covering your eyes in your fantasies. Don't ever think that I'm better than you. I just opened my eyes and I know you could too. If the only way to hear me is to live this dare. I'm gonna live this louder than your ears can bear.     </segment3>
