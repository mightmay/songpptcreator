		<segment1>Bob Hartman and Greg Bailey. Phil 3:13-14</segment1>
		<segment2>Life is filled with many chances. Some you took, and you some you blew. Your path in life can turn ever so quickly. On everthing you say. And change with everything you do</segment2>
		<segment3>I know that was then. There's nothing I can do about what might have been</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). Would'a, should'a, could'a done this and that. Don't wanna live life with another regret. Would'a, should'a, could'a made another choice. I can see more the older I get. Would'a, should'a, could'a said something more. But it's too late - there's a knock at the door. Would'a, should'a, could'a won't change a thing. The here and now is waiting</segment4>
		<segment5>Would'a, should'a, could'a right now</segment5>
		<segment6>We dig our pit, we make our bed. That's where we fall and where we lay. But we still have a shot to make things better. 'Cause it ain't over yet. And we can get it right today. We can make the right choice. You know it's easy when you hear God's voice</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>I want to live my life not only thinking of the past. The future tells me that my life has not been cast. I want to say &quot;I will, I did&quot; instead of could or should. Gonna believe in the promise &quot;It's all good&quot;</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus).     </segment9>
