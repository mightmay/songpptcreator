		<segment1>Today the things familiar to me are gone. And i'm here in some strange place. With nothing to say. And all of my life. I've had someplace to go. Some purpose to serve. And something to say</segment1>
		<segment2>If i sing at the top of my lungs. It won't say a thing if i haven't loved. The things i realize here. The plans that i make they fail miserably. I feel alone and i feel empty. But i feel alive with something to say. If i sing at the top of my lungs. It won't say a thing</segment2>
		<segment3>I found it again. So i'll sing it loud. The plan was all that i knew. And all i could say. I feel alive and i feel alone. To sing at the top of my lungs    </segment3>
