		<segment1>Sweet Jesus, wash over me. Would come and sweep me off of my feet, please. It's been two long weeks since You've heard me speak. And I was hoping that You might like to meet me. I heard You heal the broken hearted. Even those who've been discarded. Oh how I need You. I need to hear You say. Need to hear You say</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't worry now. Don't worry how. Everything just seems to all work out. Would You sing me now to sleep</segment2>
		<segment3>Sweet Jesus, wash over me. Would come and sweep me off of my feet, please. It's been far too long since I've sang Your song. And I was hoping that You might like to meet me. I heard You heal the broken hearted. Even those who've been discarded. Oh how I need You. I need to hear You say. Need to hear You say</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't worry now. Don't worry how. Everything just seems to all work out. Would You sing me now to sleep    </segment4>
