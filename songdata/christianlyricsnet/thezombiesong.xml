		<segment1>Were like zombies. Like the walking dead. With Xs (excess) in our eyes. And music in our heads. Weve forgotten. Our first love. And made it pictures. Of crosses and doves</segment1>
		<segment2>Remember when we were real. Back when we could feel?. Once we were in this. Now were of this. Jesus, turn these tables over</segment2>
		<segment3>We all follow. But were standing still. Reciting dead words. With hopeless zeal. Were all preachers. With our mouths closed. Clothing messages. In sugar coats</segment3>
		<segment4>Remember when we were real. Back when we could feel?. Once we were in this. Now were of this. Jesus, turn these tables over</segment4>
		<segment5>I wanna hide beneath the pretty paint. I wanna be okay with everything. I wanna be transformed and stay the same. I wanna be dry in the rain</segment5>
		<segment6>Remember when we were real. Back when we could feel?. Once we were in this. Now were of this. Jesus, turn these tables over</segment6>
		<segment7>Running in this stupid circle. Running in the stupid circle. Our souvenirs wont be worth a single thing. And Truth will never be in    </segment7>
