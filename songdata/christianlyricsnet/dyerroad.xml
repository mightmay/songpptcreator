		<segment1>walkin' down dyer road. thinking 'bout life and lovin' living. happy to know what i know. glad to lead the life that i've been given. not to say i never get down. i have had my share of sheer frustration. through it all i finally found. i've got a God that knows my situation</segment1>
		<segment2>i know it'll be alright. i know it'll be alright</segment2>
		<segment3>walkin' down dyer road. im delighted to know God is watching. giving me just enough. information to keep me in trusting. sending me a sign now and then. just to make sure that im still listening. every single promise has been true to everyone. you better trust Him..</segment3>
		<segment4>it's alright. although sometimes i wonder. alright, alright, if i believe at all. i do, i've discovered..    </segment4>
