		<segment1>In the howling wind, comes a stinging rain. You see it driving the nails into the souls on the tree of pain. From these fireflies, a red, orange glow. You see the face of fear running scared in the valley below. Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky</segment1>
		<segment2>In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum. Where Jacob wrestled the angel and the angel was overcome. You plant this demon seed, you raise a flower of fire. You see them burning crosses, you see the flames higher and higher</segment2>
		<segment3>Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky</segment3>
		<segment4>Suit and tie comes up to me. His face red like a rose on a thorn bush. With all the colors of a royal flush. And he's peeling off those dollar bills, slapping them down. One hundred, two hundred. And I can see those fighter planes, I can see those fighter planes. Across the mud huts the children sleep. Through the alleys of a quiet city streets. You take the staircase to the first floor. Turn the key and slowly unlock the door. A man breathes into a saxophone. Through the walls you hear the city groan. Outside it's America, outside it's America</segment4>
		<segment5>Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky. Bullet the blue sky.     </segment5>
