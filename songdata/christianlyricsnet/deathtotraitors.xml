		<segment1>A line drawn in the sand. And we both know. I'm not about to bury myself. Sinking in my footsteps. But not coming up for air. A firm foundation of beating hearts. Is blistering enough on the surface. Closing in and holding out my breath. Hoping to mend the wounds. Opened by years of digging out. We fight fire with fire. And you'll run back to your. Circles of friends. They won't help you now. We drew a line in the sand. And this time it's now or never. Go ahead and burn your bridges. But only if you can swim. Deep in the sea of disbelief. This time your screams won't be heard. You will fight this battle. But we'll take you out so quickly. That you and your so-called army. Couldn't see us coming. Fight this battle. We'll tear you down to the ground. We can't stop now. We were born for battle. Without vision we will die. We were born for battle. Against the tide of compromise. There is life in this. The places so close can take you so far. We won't trust our eyes to keep us there    </segment1>
