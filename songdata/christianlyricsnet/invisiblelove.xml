		<segment1>If my arms could reach around you. I would never move. If my eyes could see you. I'd have no faith to prove. The wonder of invisible love </segment1>
		<segment2>This is how it has to be. With you and me. The wonder of invisible love </segment2>
		<segment3>When I fall I feel your arms. Before I reach the ground. Lord, I know your whisper. Though I've never heard the sound. The wonder of invisible love </segment3>
		<segment4>This is how it has to be. With you and me. The wonder of invisible.. </segment4>
		<segment5>Someday there will be no time to mind. I will be your long awaited bride. We will dance away the night </segment5>
		<segment6>This is how it has to be. With you and me. The wonder of invisible love. Is how it has to be. With you and me. The wonder of invisible love.     </segment6>
