		<segment1>What just happened?. The Hollywood Empire strikes back. And this time I am standing in their way. Now I Waited for so long. For this to come along. Now this beauty and beast is starring in my face. Still silent voice whispers 'stay' </segment1>
		<segment2>(But in the crowd I). Caught a glimpse of your eye. Everything freezes. I'm in an old photograph. I'm back from the start. Caught a glimpse of your eye. Everything freezes and I'm ready. To give you my heart </segment2>
		<segment3>Mayday, mayday. Too many voices too much noise in my ear. Don't want to lose contact over this black ocean. Now you sing follow love. I'll be safe in devotion </segment3>
		<segment4>(But in the crowd I). Caught a glimpse of your eye. Everything freezes. I'm in an old photograph. I'm back from the start. Caught a glimpse of your eye. Everything freezes and I'm ready. To give you my heart.     </segment4>
