		<segment1>Says she likes me to all of her friends. Cold Shoulders what she pretends. I buy Americano every Morning. Rings me up and winks with no warning. At the park with nobody else. Purple boots and her basquiot belt. Lights up when she sees my faces. Turns red as shes turning away</segment1>
		<segment2>All I ever know baby. All these games that youre playing. You keep driving me crazy. Gonna get there get there</segment2>
		<segment3>She got the honey and I got some money to buy her a big bouquet. She got the loving leaves me with nothing I just dont know what to say. Well Id beg, steal and borrow if tomorrow shed stay. She got the honey I dont think its funny that she keeps walking away. Back to the beginning</segment3>
		<segment4>Saw her down at the de la show. Walking in looking down at ther toes. Tall like a flower on the wall. High heal stealing looks across the hall. I step up shes turning real red now. Deep breath how you doing wow. Caught you catch the corner of my eye. She got a call gotta go goodbye. Were gonna get there get there</segment4>
		<segment5>She got the honey and I got some money to buy her a big bouquet. She got the loving leaves me with nothing I just dont know what to say. Well Id beg, steal and borrow if tomorrow shed stay. She got the honey I dont think its funny that she keeps walking away. Back to the beginning</segment5>
		<segment6>Its amazing that I could be standing tall. Its like a million lightening bolts. When she walks right through the door. Crazy every little way I come crashing down. Were gonna get there get there    </segment6>
