		<segment1> have traveled so far to find so little. meaning in tragedy or tragedy. in the search for meaning. dark clouds have lead me here. confined freedom. guides us to security. what if everything. i have been taught is a lie. and all of my teachers. have been wrong this whole time. compelling us to fight. the battles they would not. they have already won. and we have already lost. if we don not learn from their mistakes. we have already lost. if we do not learn to change    </segment1>
