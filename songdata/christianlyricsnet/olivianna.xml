		<segment1>Hearts broke. When your heart stopped beating. I don't. Know if mine will ever stop bleeding</segment1>
		<segment2>Eleven minutes.. To breathe you in. I felt the darkness. When I knew I couldn't hold you again. When I knew I couldn't hold you again</segment2>
		<segment3>Olivianna, you're in the arms of God. Just a moment there is better than here</segment3>
		<segment4>Life is short but it is wide. I know it's true. You touched more souls. Than most people ever do</segment4>
		<segment5>Olivianna, you're in the arms of God. Just a moment there is better than here</segment5>
		<segment6>You could not stay with us (echoed). We will come to you (echoed). You could not stay with us (echoed). Oh oh oh oh. You're going home love. Where you belong. Oh my baby, girl. I'll see you soon</segment6>
		<segment7>Olivianna, you're in the arms of God. Just a moment there is better than here. Olivianna, you're in the arms of God. Just a moment there is better than here    </segment7>
