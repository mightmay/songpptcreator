		<segment1>One more death defying trick up your sleeve. can you made it disappear. turn a skeptic into one who believes. until i'm im the clear</segment1>
		<segment2>Help me i'm falling Help me i'm falling down. Help me i'm falling Help me i'm falling down</segment2>
		<segment3>All the vox humana echoing. Crying all at once out loud. Through the madness can you still hear me. And pull me from the crowed</segment3>
		<segment4>Help me i'm falling Help me i'm falling down. Help me i'm falling Help me i'm falling down</segment4>
		<segment5>Everything is rising past me. Take my hand you've got to catch me. Can you make it all disappear    </segment5>
