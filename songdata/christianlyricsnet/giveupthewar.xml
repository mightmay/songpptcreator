		<segment1>I read what they write. God's men of before. It's simply that I am still afraid. To give up the war. I've played all the chords. And I guess I get bored. I want to do it right. Be someone like Paul. It's simply that he was not afraid. He never gave up the war. And live when you're down. And live when you're always leaving. I want to be things. Always living. Pressing on</segment1>
		<segment2>I know what they saw. And I know there's the law. It's simply that I am still afraid. I want to give up the war. I've played all the chords. It doesn't matter at all. And live when you're down. And live when you're always leaving. I want to be things. Always living. Pressing on</segment2>
		<segment3>Always leaving. I want to be things. Always living. Pressing on</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to be things    </segment4>
