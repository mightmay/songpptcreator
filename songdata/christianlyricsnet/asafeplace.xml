		<segment1>This piece of pride, holding you down. The knives are drawn, stabbing at the pieces. The strings that held me, choking off the air. That I cant breathe, these hands around my neck</segment1>
		<segment2>I warned you, To feel what I do now. This hope that surrounds us, Keeps us safe tonight.</segment2>
		<segment3>I warned you, To feel what I do now. This hope that surrounds us, Keeps us safe tonight.</segment3>
