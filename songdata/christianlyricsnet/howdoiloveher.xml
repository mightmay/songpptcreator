		<segment1>Well you know its not the first time and it will not be the last. When you find me here on my knees praying for the storm to pass. But what I am really needing is much more than just relief. I am crying out for wisdom only you can give to me. Cause its such a mystery. Im a clueless man when it comes to knowing how to love a woman</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: How do I love her. How do I let her know she means more than anything to me. How do I love her</segment2>
		<segment3>Out of all the gifts youve given besides the very gift of life. There is none as precious to me as the treasure of my wife. And still all the love in my heart is like a raindrop to the sea. When compared to your love for herand thats why Im asking please. Will you teach me what she needs. Im an earnest man when it comes to learning how to love this woman</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus </segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: Well I know its gonna take a lifetime. To answer this prayer I pray. But thats okayCause Ive given you and her my lifetime anyway</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus </segment6>
		<segment7>How do I love her, love her. Tell me please. How do I love her. How do I love her. Wont you tell me, tell me please. How do I love her. Tell me please. Tell me, Tell me, Tell me. How do I love her. How do I love her </segment7>
