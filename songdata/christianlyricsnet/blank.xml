		<segment1>me and tom sat down one night, our goal was to write a song. we didn't want it to be too short, but we didn't want it too long. We can write about politics, we can write about the world. We can write about ourselves, we can write it about girls. But what went thru our heads was to write about this song instead. tom picked up his guitar and he started playing a tune. some words went thru my head and i started singing them too. we can write about our friends. we can write about being blue. we can write about something else. we can write about being without you. but what went thru our heads was to write about this song instead    </segment1>
