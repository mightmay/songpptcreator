		<segment1>Wait up, don't you close your eyes. Breathe life little flower. You've got 20 T-cells left to burn. Please choose life with its sweet and sour</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't sing your last lullaby. I don't think it is time</segment2>
		<segment3>We're all going to die. But we're all not meant to die young. We're all going to die. But we're all not meant to die young</segment3>
		<segment4>Wait up, don't you close your eyes. Love has been hidden in the shadow. You've got the rope already tied around your neck. One voice whispers life through your sorrow</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't sing your last lullaby. I don't think it is time</segment5>
		<segment6>We're all going to die. But we're all not meant to die young. We're all going to die. But we're all not meant to die young</segment6>
		<segment7>This is not your lullaby. Don't go to sleep. Not yet</segment7>
		<segment8>We're all going to die. But we're all not meant to die young. Wait for the sunrise. Cause we're all not meant to die young    </segment8>
