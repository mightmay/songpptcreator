		<segment1>There must be something wrong with me. I won't stop taking chances. It's nothing to do with apathy. I can't take no for an answer. Give me a reason. Why do I do it?. Would you believe it. If I told you a lie?. Give me a reason. How could I do it?. The truth isn't easy. That much I can't deny</segment1>
		<segment2>The question still remains the same. On who can I place all the blame?. The demons, devils of the world. Or is it only myself?</segment2>
		<segment3>There is something definitely wrong. With all of us. It would take a miracle of God. To make things right. There is something wrong here. With all of us..</segment3>
		<segment4>The answer lies in front of me. Confirmed by God's own Spirit. It's the pages that I read. How could I ever deny it?    </segment4>
