		<segment1>if there's a love song left to sing. then what i have is what i'll bring. and nothing more. it's more than i can give</segment1>
		<segment2>if there's a light left in my eyes. it must be your reflection from the sky. 'cause all i know is this. you are the wonder of my world</segment2>
		<segment3>you are an ocean. i can get lost in the first wind of my shore. you are the sunrise. to open my eyes and the dark night is no more. you are an ocean. you are an ocean</segment3>
		<segment4>and every time i turn around. so much more left to behind. and every glimpse steals my breath away. so open up these eyes to see. more of you and less of me. all of my fear is turning into faith. you are the wonder of my world</segment4>
		<segment5>you are an ocean. i can get lost in the first wind of my shore. you are the sunrise. to open my eyes and the dark night is no more. you are an ocean. you are an ocean</segment5>
		<segment6>i'm drowning in your love. i'm drowning in your love. not coming up. i'm not coming up. 'cause you're all i've ever wanted. you are an ocean. you are an ocean</segment6>
		<segment7>you are an ocean. i can get lost in the first wind of my shore. you are the sunrise. to open my eyes and the dark night is no more. you are an ocean. you are an ocean. you are an ocean. you are an ocean    </segment7>
