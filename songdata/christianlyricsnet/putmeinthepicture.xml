		<segment1>(suddenly my mind is photographic.). You know that I, I'm the last thing You expected </segment1>
		<segment2>You've seen my smile, took Your heart by surprise. its like magic, suddenly Your mind is photographic. You can see me right by Your side </segment2>
		<segment3>right out of nowhere You put me in the picture. its looking like we could belong this way. right from the moment You put me in the picture. everyday has been a, a blue sky kind of beautiful day </segment3>
		<segment4>You've got me, yeah, I'm right there in Your pocket. and I hold You close to my heart. yeah, I admit there's been a little shift in the way I view things. now I see what Your true colors really are. (chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>every flash of inspiration. everything has changed inside my world. as I always pictured it could be. taking my sweet time. keeping my heart mine. then You walked away. and I heard You say. smile for the camera </segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus).     </segment6>
