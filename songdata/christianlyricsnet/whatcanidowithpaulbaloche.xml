		<segment1>When I see the beauty. Of the sunset's glory. Amazing artistry. Across the evening sky. When I feel the mystery. Of a distant galaxy. It awes and humbles me. To be loved by a God so high</segment1>
		<segment2>What can I do but thank you. What can I do but give. My life to you. Hallelujah, hallelujah. What can I do but praise you. Every day make everything I do. A hallelujah, a hallelujah. Hallelujah</segment2>
		<segment3>When I hear the story. Of a God of mercy. Who shared humanity. And suffered by our side. Of the cross they nailed you to. That could not hold you. Now you're making all things new. By the power of your risen life</segment3>
