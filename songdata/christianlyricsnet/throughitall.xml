		<segment1>Verse 1. I've had many tears and sorrows, I've had questions for tomorrow, there's been times I didn't know right from wrong. But in every situation, God gave me blessed consulation, that my trials come to only make me strong.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Through it all, through it all, I've learned to trust in Jesus, I've learned to trust in God.</segment2>
		<segment3>Through it all, through it all, I've learned to depend upon His Word.</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2. I've been to lots of places, I've seen a lot of faces, there's been times I felt so all alone. But in my lonely hours, yes, those precious lonely hours, Jesus lets me know that I was His own</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Verse 3. I thank God for the mountains, and I thank Him for the valleys, I thank Him for the storms He brought me through. For if I'd never had a problem, I wouldn't know God could solve them, I'd never know what faith in God could do.    </segment6>
