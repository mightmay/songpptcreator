		<segment1>Dig my hands into the earth. Sometimes I need You so bad it hurts. I want You now more than ever. Ive been living in a foreign land. Confession of a broken man. I want You now more than ever</segment1>
		<segment2>The more I see, the more I want. The more I know, it doesnt stop. Your beauty speaks to call me home. Now more than ever. The more I feel that You are here. The more the world disappears. And all I want is to be home. Now more than ever</segment2>
		<segment3>So tell me something that I havent heard. Ill be hanging on every word. I want You now more than ever. How long must You make me wait. Give me hope, give me strength. I want You now more than ever</segment3>
		<segment4>I will keep my eyes open. Keep my eyes open. Face to the sky. I will keep my eyes open. Keep my eyes open for You.     </segment4>
