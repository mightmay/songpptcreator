		<segment1>It is good to praise You lord. To make music to Your holy name most high. To sing a song of Your love in the morning. And Your faithfulness, Your faithfulness at night </segment1>
		<segment2>Your deeds have made me glad. I sing for joy at the work of Your hands. You turned my mourning into dancing. And the foolish man just can't understand why </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh I just want to sing Your praise. You're exalted forever. Oh let heaven and earth proclaim. You're exalted forever, God </segment3>
		<segment4>Clothed in glory. In splendor you are arrayed. Angels surround Your throne. Crying holy is your name    </segment4>
