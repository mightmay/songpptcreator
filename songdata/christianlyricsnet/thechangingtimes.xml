		<segment1>never expected it to arrive so soon. but as the night drifted on. it came time to say goodbye. turning your back and walking away. this cold winter morning is all that remains. why couldn't you tell me to my face. instead of hiding until i lost faith. a heart gets broken as a life gets set free. and all i asked was love me. years passed, seasons changed and i waited. (hate time to say goodbye, hate time). soon after was the pain. that would never reach you. you've gotten over me. but it seems i'll never get over you. on me i place this blame. regrets. praying heaven will open wide. and hold you tight. as for me, i'll be alright. this impact you would have. the songs i'd write. dreams or you changing your mind. anything to pass the time. but for now. i hope you can hear me as i cry. i love you and goodbye    </segment1>
