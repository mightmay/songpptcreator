		<segment1>Abandoned  Left for dead / Kept outside, ostracized. Unwanted in your eyes / Cut me off, thrown aside</segment1>
		<segment2>Is this why I was born? / Is this what I come from?. This world has been lost long ago / God is my home</segment2>
		<segment3>Estranged, bastard I am / Never had the reasons why. God has taken me in / Healed my wounds, loved me in my sin</segment3>
		<segment4>Is this why I was born? / Is this what I come from?. This world has been lost long ago / God is my home</segment4>
		<segment5>God has taken the one you never wanted. My home  God is my home    </segment5>
