		<segment1>If not for Christ I would surely fall. Over myself and bear the fault. Of all my deeds so terrible. If not for Christ I would surely fall. If not for Christ I would surely fall</segment1>
		<segment2>If not for Christ I would surely break. Under the weight of my mistakes. And in my sin be kept away. If not for Christ I would surely break. If not for Christ I would surely break</segment2>
		<segment3>It was for me He bled and died. It was my sword that pierced His side. It was my name that Jesus cried. When on that tree He bled and died. It was for me He bled and died</segment3>
		<segment4>And now to Christ I owe it all. He is to me a tower strong. Salvation does to me belong. It is to Christ I owe it all. It is to Christ I owe it all     </segment4>
