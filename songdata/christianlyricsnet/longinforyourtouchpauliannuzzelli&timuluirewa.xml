		<segment1>Longin' for Your touch. Lord I come to You. Lord I'm reaching for Your love again. Longin' for Your touch. I can feel Your love. Lord I'm reaching out to You. If I need a friend on whom I can depend. Then Jesus, You will be there for me. If I have a need then all I have to see. Is Jesus, You're always there for me    </segment1>
