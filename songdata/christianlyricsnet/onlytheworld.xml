		<segment1>Been a hard one. Been a bad one. Been a tough one. Been a sad one. It's been just one of those days. That keeps chipping away at my heart. Nothin' new here. It's what I do here. It's a stereotypical day in the life. I'm surrounded by all of the pain and the strife. But I know it's alright </segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause it's only the world I'm living in. It's only today I've been given. There ain't no way I'm giving in. 'Cause it's only the world. I know the best is still yet to come. 'Cause even when my days in the world are done. There's gonna be so much more than only the world for me </segment2>
		<segment3>Anybody, do you hear me?. Do you feel me?. I mean do you feel me?. I know I'm not the only one wearing the weight of this world. We got problems, said it's alright. Just remember, yeah it's alright. Take a good look around. We're just stuck on the ground for a little while. Don't it make you smile </segment3>
		<segment4>Heaven is a place. Where the tears on every face will be wiped away. Oh and I can't wait to go. But for now, it's enough to know. This is only temporary    </segment4>
