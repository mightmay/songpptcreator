		<segment1>One Day I will leave this body. and I will get a perfect one. That day I will see His glory. shining like the noonday sun. One day, I'll take a walk with Jesus. He might explain the mysteries of life. Some say, I just can't believe it. but I know that one day</segment1>
		<segment2>We will gather at the Crystal Throne. All these years: we1re finally home. I can actually see His face. And all I can do is say,</segment2>
		<segment3>Holy, Holy is the Lord Almighty, Who was and is and is to come. We lay our crowns before You. Every heart and soul: adore You: The God of gods, Almighty One</segment3>
		<segment4>One Day, death will be abolished. And sin will have its mastery no more. And I know that we will be astonished. At all that our Creator has in store. One day we will meet our Savior. And He will give each one of us a stone. Engraved with our names upon it: known by God alone.     </segment4>
