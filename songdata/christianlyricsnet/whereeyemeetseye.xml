		<segment1>One glimpse of You and I shrink. The hand of shame squeezes my stomach. You don't really know me I allowed myself to think. One glimpse of You and I know it's not in your nature to turn your back. And I want to give You more than I have got. So tiny I'm almost disappearing in this world. You're holding in your hand. Still you know my name</segment1>
		<segment2>This is my heart resting in the palm of my hand. This is more then I've planned from the start. Holding it up to the sky for you to see. I feel You but don't understand</segment2>
		<segment3>The second You stepped through the door or was it the ceiling. I stood and beheld your beauty. This worn-out skin is pealing. I will never again praise You because of duty</segment3>
		<segment4>I want my heart to break for the things that make. Your heart break    </segment4>
