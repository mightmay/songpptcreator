		<segment1>Flat face on the ground. Youre unbelievable. A love thats never bound. Its unbelievable. Straight shooter without looking. Ready or not - heres whats cooking. Youve got me fazed. Your grace is unbelievable</segment1>
		<segment2>You have filled me once again. Steer me straight to be the man. After your own heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Just as a man so unretrievable. I tried to walk without looking. It's clear to see that you're not joking </segment3>
		<segment4>    </segment4>
