		<segment1>Oh I think its strange. Your face is on my wall. How the times have changed. Ill never see you again. Fun is fun; done is done. So, come home; come home. If I could meet someone, would it replace you? Through these changing times, I could carry on. Fun is fun; done is done. So, come home; come home.    </segment1>
