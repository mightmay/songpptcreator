		<segment1>Send the armies and darkest hours. Every flag, every sword and power. I will never turn. I will never turn. No, no, I will never turn from You. Take the lives of our sons and daughters. Lead me out like a lamb to slaughter. I will never turn. I will never turn. No, no, I will never turn from you</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Only your name's on my soul. Only your cross left to hold. Only your love's in my veins. Only for your fame</segment2>
		<segment3>Let a kiss from the world seduce me. Warm my skin with a touch (and) confuse me. I will never turn. I will never turn. No, no, I will never turn from You</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus 2X</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge x3: I'm not giving in. Not selling out. Not giving up. Not bowing down</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat Chorus x2 w/ bridge:</segment6>
		<segment7>Leave me lonely abused and battered. All the pieces of my world scattered. I will never turn. I will never turn. No, no I will never turn from You     </segment7>
