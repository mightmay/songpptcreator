		<segment1>Yeah my life is yours. I've been back and forth. Running from this war. But you redeemer sing over me. New life is the melody. He's ready for you. Ready for me?. To stop and breathe. Abandon all the things that fail to leave</segment1>
		<segment2>Let go let yourself fall into the light. Need to learn to let go. Let the old die</segment2>
		<segment3>Yeah to you my life belongs. A fleeting vapor holding on. Until the race is won. So strange and beautiful to me. Heads turn to think that they were possibly meant to be. Love connects our brokeness shows. A pair needs one to lead and one to follow</segment3>
		<segment4>Let go let yourself fall into the light. Need to learn to let go. Let the old die</segment4>
		<segment5>So I'll run. Heading towards the one. And I'm getting closer     </segment5>
