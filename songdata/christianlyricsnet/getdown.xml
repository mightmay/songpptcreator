		<segment1>Lavishly our lives are wasted. Humbleness is left untasted. You can't live your life to please yourself, yeah. That's a tip from my mistakes. Exactly what it doesn't take. To win you've got to come in last place. To live your life you've got to lose it. And all the losers get a crown</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: I get down and He lifts me up. I get down and He lifts me up. I get down and He lifts me up. I get down</segment2>
		<segment3>All I need's another day. Where I can't seem to get away. From the many things that drag me down. I'm sure you've had a day like me. Where nothing seems to set you free. From the burdens you can't carry all alone. In your weakness He is stronger. In your darkness He shines through. When you're crying He's your comfort. When you're all alone He's carrying you</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS: I get down and He lifts me up. I get down and He lifts me up. I get down and He lifts me up. I get down</segment4>
		<segment5>This valley is so deep. I can barely see the sun. I cry out for mercy, Lord. You lift me up again</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS: I get down and He lifts me up. I get down and He lifts me up. I get down and He lifts me up. I get down     </segment6>
