		<segment1>Deep in the jungle up in the trees in Indiana, 1983. Living on pizza and too little sleep. Just me and my animal friends. Then in the distance I saw through the leaves. A creature of beauty like none I had ever seen. The trouble started when you smiled at me. And our two worlds came crashing together. And a true love story began</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I am Tarzan you are Jane. I am night and you are the day. Were like sunshine and rain. Were so different from each other. You are woman I am man. You are the sea and I am the land. And I would not be who I am if I didnt have you </segment2>
		<segment3>I know that some days we both wonder how. We ever got together. Cause were still so different now. But I cant imagine my life without you. Cause all those things that make us so different. Are just what make us all that we are</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>If I didnt have you. If I didnt have you. We belong together     </segment5>
