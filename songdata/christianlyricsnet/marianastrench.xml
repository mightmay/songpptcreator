		<segment1>This ship is sinking, deeper and deeper. We've abandoned this vessel and left the captain for dead. Waves thirst for our passing. Waves thirst for our passing. Prepare for the struggle. Prepare to engage. Our armor tight to the skin, this shield it bears His name. We are strapped to the teeth, but our swords are lodged tightly in our throats. We are going under. We cannot swim under these conditions. We're drowning quicker and quicker. We cannot swim, we cannot swim, we can't swim under these conditions. We are drowning quicker and quicker. We cannot swim, we cannot swim under these conditions... We have become what we have feared (We have become what we have feared), being one with this world. We've become one with this world. Yeah.. Pray for Heaven's titans to rain down, and spare us the pain. We're going under. We're going under. Pray for Heaven's titans to rain down, and spare us the pain. We're going under. We're going under. Under, under, under, under..    </segment1>
