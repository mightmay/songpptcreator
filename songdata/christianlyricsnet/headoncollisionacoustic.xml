		<segment1>He was a simple boy, he just liked to have fun. He never wanted to be just like his dad was. He was a dreamer but he had never had none. Who made the most of his life but never had one</segment1>
		<segment2>He was a single boy he could never slow down. He always wanted to leave but didn't know how. He was a dreamer who seemed to never break ground. Who spent most of his life in a small town</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. Shake up my life. Lets go.. Back to the days when we were young and the restless. We still believed and hadn't built our defenses. I'll tell you one thing's for sure. Till we make the decision. We'll never take this world. Unless we make a head on collision. A head on collision</segment3>
		<segment4>And daddy told her she could never have. Late night help with her math. So she sits crying by the window. Every time she gets another A. She makes it another day. And it's just that simple</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus]</segment5>
		<segment6>Here they come now. Will you come down?. Make 'em run now. On to the next town. Here they come now. Let's make 'em run now. No time to fake now. Everything breaks down</segment6>
		<segment7>Here they come now. Will you come down?. Make 'em run now. On to the next town. Here they come now. Let's make 'em run now. No time to fake now. Everything breaks down</segment7>
		<segment8>(He was a simple boy he just liked to have fun. He never wanted to be just like his dad was. He was a dreamer but he had never had none. Who made the most of his life but never had one)</segment8>
		<segment9>Here they come now. Will you come down?. Make 'em run now. On to the next town</segment9>
		<segment10>Let's go.. Back to the days when we were young and the restless. We still believed and hadn't built our defenses. I'll tell you one thing's for sure. Till we make the decision. We'll never take this world. Unless we make a head on collision</segment10>
		<segment11>Let's go.. Back to the days when we were young and all restless. We still believed and hadn't built our defenses. I'll tell you one thing's for sure. Till we make the decision. We'll never take this world. Unless we make a head on collision</segment11>
		<segment12>Don't you know. There's more to this than we thought. 'cause we were never listening. We heard it all before but we missed it. When all we needed was a head on collision</segment12>
		<segment13>Don't you know. There's more to this than we thought. 'cause we were never listening. We heard it all before but we missed it. When all we needed was a head on collision.     </segment13>
