		<segment1>On a Sunday morning in the back row. Never thought I'd end up there. 'Cause I was running from You. Down a dead end road, I was just too scared</segment1>
		<segment2>To ever let You in so deep. To think that You could rescue me</segment2>
		<segment3>But You were always out there calling my name. Through it all, You always loved me the same. I was running so fast when You grabbed my hand. Saying, &quot;I won't let you fall away&quot;. You were always out there calling my name</segment3>
		<segment4>I never knew Your love could be strong enough. To make me turn that page. From a sinner so lost to a sinner. That's swimming in a sea of grace</segment4>
		<segment5>'Cause You were there all along. Always chasing after me. I don't know why it took so long. For me to finally see</segment5>
		<segment6>That You were always out there calling my name. Through it all, You always loved me the same. I was running so fast when You grabbed my hand. Saying, &quot;I won't let you fall away&quot;. You were always out there calling my name</segment6>
		<segment7>And when the road gets rough. It's Your voice I hear inside me. Saying don't give up. You'll never leave me. You'll never leave me</segment7>
		<segment8>You are always right here calling my name. And through it all, You always love me the same. And when I'm running so fast, Jesus pull me back. Don't ever let me fall away</segment8>
		<segment9>Let me always hear You calling my name. Let me always hear You calling my name. Let me always hear You calling my name, yeah    </segment9>
