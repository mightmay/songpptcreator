		<segment1>inside a shape of equal sides. that number three. with eyes inane. reminding of this urgency. scalene so far. uncertain of everyone. and by degrees, isosceles comes. I know it came out from the inside. I know places where you can hide. taken on an angle less than twenty-seven. nothing more. spoken of a fable and a candle broken on the floor    </segment1>
