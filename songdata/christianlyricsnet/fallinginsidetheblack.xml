		<segment1>Tonight I'm so alone. This sorrow takes ahold. Don't leave me here so cold. (Never want to be so cold)</segment1>
		<segment2>Your touch used to be so kind. Your touch used to give me life. I've waited all this time, I've wasted so much time</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't leave me alone. Cause I barely see at all. Don't leave me alone, I'm</segment3>
		<segment4>Falling in the black. Slipping through the cracks. Falling to the depths can I ever go back. Dreaming of the way it used to be. Can you hear me. Falling in the black. Slipping through the cracks. Falling to the depths can I ever go back. Falling inside the black. Falling inside falling inside the black</segment4>
		<segment5>You were my source of strength. I've traded everything. That I love for this one thing. (Stranded in the offering)</segment5>
		<segment6>Don't leave me here like this. Can't hear me scream from the abyss. And now i wish for you my desire</segment6>
		<segment7>Don't leave me alone. Cause I barely see at all. Don't leave me alone, I'm</segment7>
		<segment8>Falling in the black. Slipping through the cracks. Falling to the depths can I ever go back. Dreaming of the way it used to be. Can you hear me. Falling in the black. Slipping through the cracks. Falling to the depths can I ever go back. Falling inside the black. Falling inside falling inside the black. Black, black, black</segment8>
		<segment9>Falling in the black.. Slipping through the cracks..</segment9>
		<segment10>Falling in the black. Slipping through the cracks. Falling to the depths can I ever go back. Dreaming of the way it used to be. Can you hear me. Falling in the black. Slipping through the cracks. Falling to the depths can I ever go back. Falling inside the black. Can you hear me?. Falling inside the black. Can you hear me?. Falling inside the black. Can you hear me?. Falling inside. Falling inside, falling inside the black    </segment10>
