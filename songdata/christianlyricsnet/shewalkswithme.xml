		<segment1>Whitney, I hope you know how much. I love you. this song's for you. dad.</segment1>
		<segment2>From the first breath of her life. She flew straight into my arms. I used to catch her from the swings. When she was five.. And now she dances on the wind. In a world as hard as stone. She's so anxious to begin. And ready to fly..</segment2>
		<segment3>And she walks with me. And she talks with me. And I hold her hand in mine. I know she'll find her way. Like the light of day. Cause it's love that makes her strong</segment3>
		<segment4>Though I cannot stop the rain. And I cannot turn the tide. And I am sure there will be things. That break her heart. I can only let her know. I am always on her side. And even as I let her go. I'll never be far</segment4>
		<segment5>And she walks with me. And she talks with me. In her eyes I see her truth. Born of her fire and grace. As she finds her place. Cause it's love that makes her strong</segment5>
		<segment6>And she walks with me. And she talks with me. In my eyes she'll see my prayer. As she turns each page. Through this tender age. It is love that makes her strong. It's her love that makes her strong    </segment6>
