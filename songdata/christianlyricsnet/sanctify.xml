		<segment1>Here I am in that old place again. Down on my face again. Crying out I want you to hear my plea. Come down and rescue me</segment1>
		<segment2>How long will it take. How long will I have to wait?</segment2>
		<segment3>And all I want is all you have. Come to me, rescue me, Fall on me with your love. And all you want is all I have. Come to me, rescue me, fall on me with your love</segment3>
		<segment4>Sanctify I want to be set apart. Right to the very heart. Prophesy to the four winds. And breathe life to this very place</segment4>
		<segment5>How long will it take?. How long will I have to wait?</segment5>
		<segment6>And all I want is all you have. Come to me rescue me, Fall on me with your love. And all you want is all I have. Come to me rescue me, Fall on me with your love</segment6>
		<segment7>Lifted up I've climbed with the strength I have. Right to this mountain top. Looking out.. The cloud's getting bigger now.. It's time.. to get ready now    </segment7>
