		<segment1>Help me out God I need a little something. Turn the brights on I can't see where we're going. Cause I don't know when things'll work out just fine. Or if this road we're on leads us up. Or is leading me on down to my wishing well. Where I might drown oh I might drown. Cause I can't swim without you God </segment1>
		<segment2>Help me out God I need a little something. Hold my hand so I know that I'm not falling down. Or spinning round or am I really just fine. Is this vertigo I feel just simply fear or maybe real. It's a long way down and I might fall and I might fall. Cause I can't stand without you God </segment2>
		<segment3>Help me out God I need a little something. Just enough so I don't lose hope before morning comes. Cause in the sun things'll work out just fine. But this night's been extra long I fear I won't make it to the Dawn. Cause the night is dark and I might doubt and I might doubt. Cause I can't hope without you God </segment3>
		<segment4>Just enough for today get me through 'til tomorrow     </segment4>
