		<segment1>I hear the Spirit calling me. And I'm ready to answer. I am laying down my pride. to hear the cry of your comfort. I've felt Your tug upon my heart. and it's setting me free now. I can't deny your reckless love. So, I'm bending a knee</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I, I don't want to wake up. trying to make it through. lost and confused I don't want to survive. I want to live</segment2>
		<segment3>You, You You are life life beyond the veil. Beyond what's safe and normal, what is possible. You, You satisfy You're more than just a fantasy of faith, a phase. You are everything -. You're life re:defined.</segment3>
		<segment4>You are the love that finds a way. I cannot deny it. I've tried to run and make my way. But I'm turning towards home now. You are the wisdom that I need. And the reason I'm longing. For more than just a nation dream. I hear eternity calling!</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: I'm laying it all down Just for one glimpse of your face. It's gonna be worth it, it's gonna be worth it (4x)    </segment5>
