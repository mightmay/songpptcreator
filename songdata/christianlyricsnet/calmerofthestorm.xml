		<segment1>When everything is wrong. The day has passed and nothing's done. And the whole world seems against me. When I'm rolling in my bed, there's a storm in my head. I'm afraid of sinking in despair.</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS:</segment2>
		<segment3>Teach me, Lord to have faith. In what you're bringing me will. Change my life and bring you glory &amp;</segment3>
		<segment4>There on the storm I am learning to let go. Of the will that I so long to control. There may I be in your arms eternally. I thank you, Lord, you are the calmer of the storm.</segment4>
		<segment5>You rebuke the wind and the waves. Once again I find I'm amazed &amp; the power of your will. Cuz I'm a child of little faith. I feel the wind and forget your grace. And you say, &quot;Peace, be still.&quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>There on the storm I am learning to let go. The white wave's high, it's crashing o'er the deck. And I don't know where I go. Where are you Lord, is my ship going down?. The mast is gone so throw the anchor. Should I jump and try to swim to land?</segment6>
		<segment7>There on the storm, teach me God to understand. Of the Will that I just cannot control. There may I see all you love protecting me. I thank you Lord, you are the calmer of the storm.    </segment7>
