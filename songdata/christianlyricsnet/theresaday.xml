		<segment1>the sun set down behind the trees. how quickly did my skin. sense the chill upon the breeze. and i'm uneasy; the night surrounds me as</segment1>
		<segment2>dusk ushers out the light of day. a symbol to be sure that my life can't forever stay</segment2>
		<segment3>there's a day when there will be no night. there's a day when there will be no night. don't you know the lamb will be our light</segment3>
		<segment4>vassal, star and noble moon. your King comes riding soon. and as i mourn this loss of mine. i'll leave it up for you to shine</segment4>
		<segment5>darkness makes the baby cry. so the father sings. a lullaby to drive the tears away.    </segment5>
