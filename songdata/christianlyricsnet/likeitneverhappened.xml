		<segment1>As deep, as deep as the ocean floor. As high, as high as the eagle soars. As far, as far as a falling star can go. You've taken all of my mistakes and put them anywhere but close, they have gone away. From the East to the West, any height any depth that's where it goes. From the ground to the sky, from low to high that's where it goes. You act just like.like it never happened. Asleep, asleep, asleep am I in a dream?. You're in this life, someone pinch me. So good, so good you'd think I would be in a trace. Your forgiving weighs in every circumstance. From the East to the West, any height any depth that's where it goes. From the ground to the sky, from low to high that's where it goes. You act just like.like it never happened. Deep, wide, low, high my sins are gone away. And if I'm up, down, or all around I can hear You say &quot;They are gone away.&quot;.     </segment1>
