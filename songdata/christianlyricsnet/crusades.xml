		<segment1>I used to be so young and invincible. The mistakes of my youth are finally catching up to me. The face that stares back in the mirror should carry nothing but pride. As the days go by, it's getting harder to hold my head up high. I've never been so tired, I've never felt so weak, But I swear to you that I'm not giving up. My storied life is coming to a graceful descent. Descend. I see peace end and battles begin. I won't forget the lives I touched. I won't forget the life I know. As the days go by, it's getting harder to hold my head up high. I used to think I'd last forever. I'm praying for the light to just carry me away. Say goodnight. Say goodbye. This is my time to be with my Lord.    </segment1>
