		<segment1>I know You love me. I know You died for me. I know You care. I know You care</segment1>
		<segment2>I know You live again. Your life for all my sin. Now I stand here in. In Your grace again</segment2>
		<segment3>As I look into the sky above. Wonder how my life has changed. Wonder how Your love, it came to me. As I look into the sky above. All my fears, so far away. All I feel is heaven calling me</segment3>
		<segment4>So I look to You. So I look to You. No one else will do. No one else will do    </segment4>
