		<segment1>Oh there's nothing like a heart that listens, or a secret has a friend. A brother or a sister, faithful to the end. Well there's nothing like hands to hold onto, when confidence is gone. A family of faith to help you carry on.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: We all need each others arms around us. We all need to know somebody cares. We all need to know that when were hurting that somebody's there. We all need to be more like Jesus. We all need to lift each other up. Cause everything in life that really matters comes from his love</segment2>
		<segment3>. And never be mistaken, We are all covered with His truth. All the savior is askin is to look through me through you. You know his love is like a river, Where it flows the broken stand now. When it comes an ocean, we join hands and hearts</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus </segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus died for everyone of us. We mean everything to Him. So let's reach out with the Fathers love. Let the healing begin</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>We all need to love on another. We all need to know somebody's there. We all need keep one another. We all need to know somebody's there. We all need to be more like Jesus. We all need to lift each other up. Cause everything in life that really matters comes from his love    </segment7>
