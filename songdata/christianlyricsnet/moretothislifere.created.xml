		<segment1>
Today I watched in silence as people passed me by,. And I strained to see if there was something hidden in their eyes;. But they all looked at me as if to say. Life just goes on.</segment1>
		<segment2>The old familiar story told in different ways,. Make the most of your own journey from the cradle to the grave;. Dream your dreams tomorrow because today. Life must go on.</segment2>
		<segment3>But theres more to this life than living and dying,. More than just trying to make it through the day;. More to this life, more than these eyes alone can see,. And theres more than this life alone can be.</segment3>
		<segment4>Tonight he lies in silence staring into space,. And looks for ways to make tomorrow better than today,. But in the morning light it looks the same;. Life just goes on.</segment4>
		<segment5>He takes care of his family, he takes care of his work,. And every Sunday morning he takes his place at the church;. And somehow he still feels a need to search,. But life just goes on.</segment5>
		<segment6>But theres more to this life than living and dying,. More than just trying to make it through the day;. More to this life, more than these eyes alone can see,. And theres more than this life alone can be.</segment6>
		<segment7>So where do we start to find every part. Of what makes this life complete;. If we turn our eyes to Jesus well find. Lifes true beginning is there at the cross where He died.. He died to bring us . . .</segment7>
		<segment8>But theres more to this life than living and dying,. More than just trying to make it through the day;. More to this life, more than these eyes alone can see,. And theres more than this life alone can be.
