		<segment1>ITS TRUE IVE MADE MISTAKES, IF I HAD ONLY KNOWN. NOW I HAVE CHANGED MY WAYS, IM COMING HOME. LIKE A RETURNING SON, I LONG TO SEE YOUR FACE, YOU SMILE AS I RUN TO YOUR EMBRACE. NO EYE HAS SEEN, NO EAR HAS HEARD, NO MIND HAS CONCEIVED WHAT IS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM. NOW I AM HOMEWARD BOUND. THIS SON WAS ONCE THOUGHT DEAD. WAS LOST BUT NOW IM FOUND, ALIVE AGAIN. IM HEADING FOR A PLACE WHERE STREETS ARE PAVED WITH GOLD. ITS TIME TO CELEBRATE, HEAVEN BEHOLD. THE NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES, SUFFERED FOR MY SIN AND SHAME. WORTHY OF ALL PRAISE, COME WHAT MAY ILL SEEK YOUR FACE.     </segment1>
