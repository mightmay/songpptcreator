		<segment1>I woke up like every day before and read the news. It was there in black and white with all the whats and whos. A headline so hard to fathom it just might be true. It claimed on every thoroughfare and avenue</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Peace has broken out. In every heart. In every house. Peace has broken out. It started small. It drew a crowd. Peace has broken out</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, they say it all began right down on Fifth and Main. When somebody thought of pushing back but walked away. Somehow the people gathered round just weren't the same. And as the crowd dispersed somebody heard em say</segment3>
		<segment4>We'll watch the lambs and lions play. We've got no more flags to wave. All our rockets aim for stars. And the way things always should have been. Is just the way things are </segment4>
		<segment5>No one's sure what happened next but on and on it went. From cubicles and classrooms to the president. Headed west and east and on to every continent. The whole world woke up to read how things are different</segment5>
		<segment6>(Since)     </segment6>
