		<segment1>A song is hidden in the wind, written for you. Filter the noise and have a listen, a moment or two. You'll find the strength in you. To fade the scars, the black and blue, and stand tall </segment1>
		<segment2>Go and I will be your guide. Know if you fall I'm by your side. You breathe so you know that it's alright. You walk with your hand holding to Mine. Hope will stay with you tonight </segment2>
		<segment3>Are you buried in the darkness, the shadow of the doubt?. Lost track of time indulging yourself, I'll be your way out. I'll never let you down. We'll fade the scars, repair the heart, and stand tall </segment3>
		<segment4>My love, I have got a plan, waiting in the wings. My child the healing will begin, underneath My wings. Come with Me, Come with Me, I can save you now. Come with Me, Come with Me. Come with Me, Come with Me, You're all I've got. Come with Me, Come with Me.     </segment4>
