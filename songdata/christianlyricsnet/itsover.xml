		<segment1>Farewell, so long to you. We've come to the end of the night. It's all been wonderful. A lovely and wonderful time </segment1>
		<segment2>Say goodnight to. All the friends who. Rocked and rolled beside you </segment2>
		<segment3>We hope you've enjoyed the show. It's over. It's over. It's all over now </segment3>
		<segment4>This room will be empty soon. When the music and laughter is gone. This night will be forgot. But the joy you've found can go on </segment4>
		<segment5>Say goodnight to. All the friends who. Rocked and rolled beside you </segment5>
		<segment6>We hope you've enjoyed the show. It's over. It's over. It's all over now. The lights come down, don't lose your glow. When it's over. It's over. It's all over now </segment6>
		<segment7>Is it all over?. Or has it just begun?    </segment7>
