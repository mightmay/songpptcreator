		<segment1>GRACE IS ON ME LIKE WATER. GRACE SURROUNDS ME LIKE RIVERS DEEP, YOUR GRACE, YOUR GRACE. GRACE IS SINGING LIKE ANGELS. GRACE IS WASHING THE NATIONS FEET, YOUR GRACE, YOUR GRACE. POURING OUT, POURING OUT, POURING OUT YOUR GRACE UPON ME. POURING OUT, POURING OUT, POURING OUT MY HEART TO THANK THEE. GRACE IS LEADING ME ONWARDS. GRACE IS TEACHING ME TO FORGIVE, YOUR GRACE, YOUR GRACE. WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT. THE BLOOD OF GOD FOR SOULS OF MEN. MY KING AND REDEEMER, YOUR LIFE HAS GIFTED SALVATION.    </segment1>
