		<segment1>I ain't afraid of your laughin'. Nor afraid of your fist. Come on with it brother. your sweet betrayal kiss </segment1>
		<segment2>I ain't a scared of you no more. Nor the scars upon your wrists. These bullets you've been shootin' at me. Yeah, they all fall short an miss. Yea yo .. oh brother </segment2>
		<segment3>Get your boots on boy an get on out. An make your leavin' quick. This shack you built is on my land. An it's comin' down brick by brick. Yea yo .. oh brother </segment3>
		<segment4>Oh there's a, oh there's a willow </segment4>
		<segment5>Oh my darlin' oh my girl. Again I've made you cry. I got a mean man in me. Yeah, I guess that's why. Get oh .. oh brother. .. Upon the willow's walk ..     </segment5>
