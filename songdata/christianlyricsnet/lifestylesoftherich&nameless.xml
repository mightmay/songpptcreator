		<segment1>I know a scene you ought to see. I read it in Luke 16. So let me be I wanna set the scene. A wealthy dude his names unknown inside his sprawling home. Stuffing his mouth with that life of ease. While Lazarus is thin and weak, down the driveway on the street. I dont think he will survive. If he could get that nameless dude to feed him some leftover food. Hed take the crumbs now as theyd fall, if they would fall. Lifestyles of the rich and the nameless. The solid gold bracelets dont make you blameless. His money is not the problem. He forgot Lazarus; Think Jesus saw them. Did you know the rich and nameless dude eventually died. And when he woke up things were on the fiery side. With Lazarus across the chasm and Abraham talked to him. He said, You know its really hot in here, my throat is cracked. Send Lazarus to me, O Father Abraham. He can always just run some water down to me. Id like to help you get a drink, Abraham said, Honestly, I dont think that would suffice. But hes already paid his dues. Now he is somewhere else than you. You think thats someone elses fault? Maybe not. Lifestyles of the rich and the nameless. Theyre always so shameless. God plays no favorites. Its funny yet such a shocker. How he demanded, Bring me some water!. Lifestyles of the rich and the nameless. The one with no status God made so famous. Its funny to watch the process. Because somebody prosperous He made anonymous. Lifestyles of the rich and the nameless. Designer clothes get spots and holes; Lets shop at Payless. Lifestyles of the rich and nameless. Lights out for the rich and nameless. Find out what 2:16 James says    </segment1>
