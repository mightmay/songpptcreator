		<segment1>Blessed is the man. Who walks in Your favor. Who loves all Your words. And hides them like treasure. In the darkest place. Of his desperate heart, They are a light. A strong, sure light.</segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes I call out Your name. But I cannot find You. I look for Your face, But You are not there. By my sorrows, Lord, Lift me to You, Lift me to Your side.</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Lord of Eternity, Father of mercy, Look on my fainting soul. Keeper of all the stars, Friend of the poorest heart. Touch me and make me whole.:</segment3>
		<segment4>If You are my defender, Who is against me?. No one can trouble or harm me. If You are my strength. . All I ask, all I desire. Is to live in Your house all my days.    </segment4>
