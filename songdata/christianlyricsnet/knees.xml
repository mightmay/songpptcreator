		<segment1>Conventions in your mind consist of dualistic natures. Reason and thought two extremes. Contrary to your own words. Your logic teaches me to dropkick you in the head. It is all good for that is what your logic just said. I'm sorry for what I do. What I will please. As the kick to your head brings you on your knees. Your logic allows room for chaos. Holds no standard. How does it feel?. Too much pain for one to tolerate. For one to tolerate. Just want it to be. Whatever clevers. For you and for me. I'm sorry for what I do. What I will please. As the kick to your head brings you on your knees. You know that you can't stand up to the very word. It cuts you down. Takes you down. Tears you down to pieces then your gone.     </segment1>
