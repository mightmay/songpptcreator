		<segment1>Oh Donna, won't ya pick me up tomorrow? I need to get. out of this place I'm in, and get my life in order. Although. this world, just might fall apart, I've got enough in my. heart to get us started. Come with me, oh, I'm beggin' you. please, or just say goodbye, cuz' this is the end of me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Let's go far away from here, and not come back until the. coast is clear. I'm fallin', thinkin' of you, I count the days. and all the funny things we do. I'm so sorrym now you. ignore me, tried to explain, but it's such a long story. Now. ya never call me, saw you in the lobby, you smiled, then. pretended that you never saw me</segment2>
