		<segment1>Theres a different sunrise. Its a different world. In a way I feel like. I have just begun</segment1>
		<segment2>Like I dont remember. Waking up from a dream. All my chains are broken. And it feels so free</segment2>
		<segment3>I can breathe for the first time. I can see for the first time. Its like you opened my eyes. I can feel my heart is coming alive. I feel alive. I can breathe for the first time. For the first time. For the first time. Oooo Ooooo Oooo. For the first time. For the first time</segment3>
		<segment4>Once a life imprisoned. I was locked in the past. But your love has given. Given one more chance</segment4>
		<segment5>Once my light was fading. But you gave me yours. Now my world is brighter. Than it was before</segment5>
		<segment6>I can breathe for the first time. I can see for the first time. Its like you opened my eyes. I can feel my heart is coming alive. I feel alive. I can breathe for the first time. For the first time. For the first time. Oooo Ooooo Oooo. For the first time. For the first time</segment6>
		<segment7>And Ive never run so far. Ive never felt so strong. When I am where you are. I found where I belong. For the first time. For the first time</segment7>
		<segment8>I can breathe for the first time. I can see for the first time. Its like you opened my eyes. I can feel my heart is coming alive. I feel alive. I can breathe for the first time. For the first time. For the first time. Oooo Ooooo Oooo. For the first time. For the first time    </segment8>
