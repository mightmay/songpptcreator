		<segment1>Hey! The world is ending, don't you even know?. Well, how did evolution get so slow?. The grass don't even grow. Say! You buy and sell and throw it all away, and hope it never gets to you too late. This plan is going to blow.</segment1>
		<segment2>Everything is better and everything is right and everything comes together. and everything's done tonight if you cover me. But the music is much too loud to hear this alarm sound (too loud). Will you cover me? But the emptiness I've found can't keep me on the gound (the ground). Can you cover me?</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey! What's the point in trying to get away?. The neverending search to find escape is going to leave you cold.</segment3>
		<segment4>Everything is better and everything is right and everything comes together. and everything's done tonight if you cover me.</segment4>
		<segment5>But the music is much too loud to hear this alarm sound (too loud). Will you cover me? But the emptiness I've found can't keep me on the gound (the ground). Can you cover me?</segment5>
		<segment6>This is the last breath I, I think I'll ever take. This is the last move I, I think I'll ever make. Will there be a chance now to figure this out and to be free tonight? </segment6>
