		<segment1>What do you take me for?. You think I'm nothing more than who you think I am. I tried to live the lie. I let that lifestyle die, and now I'm something more. Now I've got a peace of mind, there's just no better way. And if I should die tonight, that would be all right. I'm gonna try real hard no matter what it takes. And even if I fail I know that when life's done. and I'm accounted for I lived it to the full.    </segment1>
