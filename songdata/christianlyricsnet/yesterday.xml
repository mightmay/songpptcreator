		<segment1>I remember a different time. I remember a different me. When there was springtime in my heart. But it's winter and I'm shivering with cynicism now. And I long for yesterday </segment1>
		<segment2>Yesterday, a day of joy. A day of limitless possibilities. I remember a different boy. With love surrounding, joy abounding. Peace resounding. Where, oh where did that boy go? </segment2>
		<segment3>What's wrong with me now, God. My world is gray. So please help me out, I pray. Cuz I want to live in yesterday </segment3>
		<segment4>Take me back to a time of naivete. Never-ending days, and no need to question things. Cuz I'm tired of staring out my window. Wishing I were someone I should be. I guess I remember a different me     </segment4>
