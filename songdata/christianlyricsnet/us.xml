		<segment1>I know we often feel the rub of love. that we don't always fit quite hand in glove. but we live inside of a mystery. and my heart often fails to contain</segment1>
		<segment2>and I know that words are not enough. when I think of all the endless love. that you give to me in my time of need. boy, it's high time these words were said [will sell]</segment2>
		<segment3>ask for my hand you know I'll give it. and if you're cold I give you warmth. and I don't care if it's unfair</segment3>
		<segment4>'cause I would sacrifice myself. now that I know. the only thing that matters. us. us. us. us</segment4>
		<segment5>it's hard to say what road we're travelling down. sometimes it leads us to some awful towns. but we somehow keep, both our hands and feet. on the floorboard and the steering wheel</segment5>
		<segment6>ask for my hand, you know I'll give it. and if you're cold I give you warmth. and I don't care if it's unfair</segment6>
		<segment7>'cause I would sacrifice myself. now that I know. the only thing that matters. us. us. us. us</segment7>
		<segment8>there was a time I lost my Â– eyes. there was a day I wasted. too much of your golden light</segment8>
		<segment9>ask for my hand. you know I gave it I give you warmth. and I don't care if it's unfair</segment9>
		<segment10>'cause I would sacrifice myself. now that I know. the only thing that matters. you're the only that matters. you're the only that matters</segment10>
		<segment11>us. us. us. us. us. us. us    </segment11>
