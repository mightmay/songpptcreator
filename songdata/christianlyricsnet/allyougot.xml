		<segment1>I heard you say that no one seems to care bout you. It's in your eyes, you think that life's unfair to you. Just give it all you got, my friend. Just give it all you got, it's not the end </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Cause you oughta know. There's a reason for these changin' seasons. God only knows how much your heart can bear. So don't you let go. Everybody has their up and down times. Everybody needs to know how much they're loved. My friend. So hold on, it's not the end </segment2>
		<segment3>As I remember everything you touch. Would turn to gold. You held the secrets. To make your grandest dreams unfold. You were the very best of us all. But the sun that rises still falls </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>It's just a love song. Cause everybody needs a friend. I'll be right here for you. Just a simple prayer. It's from the bottom of my heart. That He'll never let you go </segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
