		<segment1>Here I am. Drowning in a sea of my own choices. Holding to a hope by a thread. Yeah. I'm looking round. I'm calling out, fear pulls me down. When the waters rush over my head</segment1>
		<segment2>You are my lifeline. You are my rescue. Strength in my weakness. Light in my darkness. You are my safety. Lifter of my head. The breath that I need when. I can't seem to breath in</segment2>
		<segment3>You are my lifeline. You are my lifeline</segment3>
		<segment4>How many times. How many turns will it take till I learn. You reach for me in my need. And when I cry I will faithfully find you. When life comes crashing on me</segment4>
		<segment5>You are my lifeline. You are my rescue. Strength in my weakness. Light in my darkness. You are my safety. Lifter of my head. The breath that I need when. I can't seem to breath in</segment5>
		<segment6>You are my lifeline. You are my lifeline</segment6>
		<segment7>Your there in my brokenness. And my distress. My rock when I'm stronger when I'm powerless. You hold me and rush when tides and waters rise</segment7>
		<segment8>And I always find</segment8>
		<segment9>You are my lifeline. You are my rescue. Strength in my weakness. Light in my darkness. You are my safety. Lifter of my head. The breath that I need when. I can't seem to breath in</segment9>
		<segment10>You are my lifeline. You are my rescue. Strength in my weakness. Light in my darkness. You are my safety. Lifter of my head. The breath that I need when. I can't seem to breath in</segment10>
		<segment11>You are my lifeline. You are my lifeline. You are my lifeline. You are my lifeline!    </segment11>
