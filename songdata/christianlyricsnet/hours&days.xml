		<segment1>Wouldn't let you go down tonight. Wouldn't leave you hanging on a wire tonight. Oh these ragged hours and ragged days keep me down. Won't let me get away </segment1>
		<segment2>I could stay right here just for a while. If I asked you how, could you give a smile. Oh these wicked hours and wicked days keep me down. Won't let me get away </segment2>
		<segment3>But you do it to yourself. And it happens everytime. But you won't go down. You won't go down </segment3>
		<segment4>I'll just stand right here but don't act suprised. Because I never felt this old my whole life. Oh these endless hours and endless days keep me down. Won't let me get away </segment4>
		<segment5>But you do it to yourself. And it happens everytime. But you won't go down. You won't go down     </segment5>
