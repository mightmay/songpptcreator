		<segment1>Is there nothing new underneath the sun?. Some unfound way to tell of all You've done. I sit around and round in circles. All that I find is one thing true</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm trying to resist saying things You've heard. I'm trying to invent a new way with words. All that I find in my frustration. Is that it does not change the way I feel 'cos</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: There are no words that I could say. There is no music I could play. There is no song I could sing. To tell of all the love You bring</segment3>
		<segment4>Are all my sleepless nights just a waste of time?. Will my words mean anything if I can't make them rhyme?. You're waiting for me to break the silence. You're listening even though you already know that there..</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>There's nothing new. Underneath the sun. And I'm lost for words anyway. You're a symphony. Washing over me. Washing over me. I'm lost for words    </segment6>
