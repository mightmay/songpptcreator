		<segment1>My past won't stop haunting me. In this prison there's a fight between. Who I am and who I used to be</segment1>
		<segment2>This thorn in my side is a grace. For because of it the flesh and blood of God. Was offered in my place, my place</segment2>
		<segment3>You fought the fight in me. You chased me down and finished the race. I was blind but now I see. Jesus You kept the faith in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Where did my best friends go?. In my defense they disappeared. Just like Your friends did to You, oh Lord</segment4>
		<segment5>But You were there, You gave me strength. So this little one might come to know. The glory of Your name, Your name</segment5>
		<segment6>You fought the fight in me. You chased me down and finished the race. I was blind but now I see. Jesus You kept the faith in me</segment6>
		<segment7>Awaiting, set apart like incense to Your heart. A libation I'm pouring out. Empty and beautiful, beautiful, beautiful</segment7>
		<segment8>You fought the fight in me. You chased me down and finished the race. I was blind but now I see. Jesus You kept the faith in me</segment8>
		<segment9>You fought the fight in me. You chased me down and finished the race. I was blind but now I see. Jesus You kept the faith in me. Jesus You kept the faith in me. Savior, You kept the faith in me    </segment9>
