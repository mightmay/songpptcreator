		<segment1>Is it okay if I want to see you every minute every day. Because I miss you. Is it alright if I want to talk for hours with you every night. Because I miss you</segment1>
		<segment2>I pray to God for just one chance. To turn this into something wonderful. I pray to God for sweet romance. Cause you are something, something wonderful</segment2>
		<segment3>I love the way that your face turns to a smile when you look my way. And I can't take it. And I'll be there just to take some of the burdens that you like to wear. When you can't take it</segment3>
		<segment4>And just this once I pray. That God would give me grace. To say the words I want to say    </segment4>
