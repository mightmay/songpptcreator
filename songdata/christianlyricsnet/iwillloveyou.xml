		<segment1>VERSE1: When I think of all you are. In my life and in my heart. No words can say what I feel. Cause if everything is true. It's what I have found in you. Lord to me there is nothing so real. And though there is no way I can repay you. I'll give you whatever you want</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: I'll live a life that says you give me every song. With my every breath I'll make your mercy known. With every soul on earth or all alone. I will Love you, I will Love you</segment2>
		<segment3>VERSE2: Angels see you face to face. If I could I'd take their place. And pour out my heart to you. But what they don't understand. Is to know your grace first hand. How it feels to love like I do. Yes you bring me to my knees with your kindness Theres nothing that I can hold back</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS: I'll live a life that says you give me every song. With my every breath I'll make your mercy known. With every soul on earth or all alone. I will Love you, I will Love you</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE: With all I am and everything I have. I dedicate myself to doing one thing right</segment5>
		<segment6>I will love you oooohhh. With my every breath I'll make your mercy known. with every soul on earth or all alone. I will Love you, I will Love you. Lord, I will love you. Lord, I will love you    </segment6>
