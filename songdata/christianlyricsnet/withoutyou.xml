		<segment1>Would we hear the sound. Of breathing in the dark. Where would be life's spark. Without You</segment1>
		<segment2>Would the birds ever sing. Would the wind move through the trees. Could I touch the grass so green. Under this big sky so blue. Without You</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: And the sun doesn't shine. And my world stops spinnin' round. Without You. Tell me where else could I ever find. The peace that floods this heart of mine. Without You</segment3>
		<segment4>Who could fill the emptiness inside. Who would ease the pain in my broken heart. Who would come in and abide. Promise never to depart. Without You</segment4>
		<segment5>I can't live without You. I don't want to try to. Live one more moment without You    </segment5>
