		<segment1>Drowning, just as fast as I can. But don't throw me a line, don't reach out your hand. Because I'm on the brink of something beautiful and I want to sing about it. But I don't know where to begin. Write it in a letter but the words don't come out right. Trying to explain how nobody can do like me. You don't understand just how helpless I get since the day we met. Oh, can you feel it yet?</segment1>
		<segment2>It's never been more perfect being alive. I've never been so satisfied. Oh..</segment2>
		<segment3>I could feel something different for the first time. Heaven made sense and all the words rhymed. No chance of stopping it now. I'm taking it all. And now I'm caught in the air, It's a good glide. Pass it up, wouldn't dare, what a ride, I remember being ready and waiting to fall just like I did tonight.</segment3>
		<segment4>Spinning around and around until my left was my right and up became down. With just one look you knocked me off my feet. So unable to speak. Oh how you made me weak. Though it was a while ago, I can recall. That moment, so ready and waiting to fall. Can you take me back in time remembering when you captured my heart?. Over and Over again.</segment4>
