		<segment1>Must have been that winter cold. That made me set out on my own. I said my goodbyes and left You behind. Growing up is getting old </segment1>
		<segment2>Bring back the memories. bring back that smile because I've outgrown them. Now I remember but everything's changed. Still I'm captivated by that face You wear tonight </segment2>
		<segment3>Must have been the April thaw. That made me hunger for Your arms. You welcomed me back and you held me close. Overnights don't seem so cold </segment3>
		<segment4>Bring back the memories. Bring back that smile because I've outgrown them. Now I remember but everything's changed. Still I'm captivated by that face You wear tonight. Familiar but it looks so new in streetlight - in this light    </segment4>
