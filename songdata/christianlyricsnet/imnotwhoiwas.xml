		<segment1>I wish you could see me now. I wish I could show you how. I'm not who I was. I used to be mad at you. A little on the hurt side too. But I'm not who I was</segment1>
		<segment2>I found my way around. To forgiving you. Some time ago. But I never got to tell you so</segment2>
		<segment3>I found us in a photograph. I saw me and I had to laugh. You know, I'm not who I was. You were there, you were right above me. And I wonder if you ever loved me. Just for who I was</segment3>
		<segment4>When the pain came back again. Like a bitter friend. It was all that I could do. To keep myself from blaming you</segment4>
		<segment5>I reckon it's a funny thing. I figured out I can sing. Now I'm not who I was. I write about love and such. Maybe 'cause I want it so much. I'm not who I was</segment5>
		<segment6>I was thinking maybe I. I should let you know. I am not the same. But I never did forget your name. Hello</segment6>
		<segment7>Well the thing I find most amazing. In amazing grace. Is the chance to give it out. Maybe that's what love is all about</segment7>
		<segment8>I wish you could see me now. I wish I could show you how. I'm not who I was    </segment8>
