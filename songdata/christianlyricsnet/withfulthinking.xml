		<segment1>red eyed wonder why and how. i thought you would've left by now. so these thoughts can expire. so bow and reintroduce. what years labored to produce. these habits make it hard to shake you loose. because i don't know, i'm resisting. but you seem to go on existing. in the back of my head, can i do it again?. will you come back my friend?. hair brained. hover in my head. still and small the things you said. but reason speaks much louder. i think we've been here before. you know what i'm asking for. if you would but grant. my terms i can't ignore. i remember too clearly. too recent to forget. maybe i'll come around. but not yet    </segment1>
