		<segment1>i say hello to the summertime. and you may think i'm doing fine. but i don't know. it used to always make me laugh. but now i'll sign an autograph. to the way things used to be </segment1>
		<segment2>oh. do you hear my cry. nostalgia nostalgia. hold my hand cause i've got a ways to go. oh </segment2>
		<segment3>but i can't stand to go on like this so long. nostalgia. now i can plainly see. the way the conflict used to be neverending. i always thought that in this case. to keep a smile on my face though that's not how i feel </segment3>
		<segment4>oh. do you hear my cry. nostalgia nostalgia. don't let me down. I've always faced the truth. oh </segment4>
		<segment5>now why can't i just ignore what i've found. nostalgia. i often ride the choppy waves of change. but the reward i know is much more great. don't want to give up i cannot give in. i must maintain my faithfulness. i've seen the darkness and it's consuming. i cannot bring him back to then </segment5>
		<segment6>i must maintain my faithfulness     </segment6>
