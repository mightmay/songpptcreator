		<segment1>I'm here. You've got me. Have no fear. Savior that's me. On a stable rock I'll place you. You can rest. That I will personally will see to</segment1>
		<segment2>You called out my name. I heard you. You're healed</segment2>
		<segment3>What happens now?. You're healed. But still I'm disappearing somehow. In your cry I'll always be near. But in your laughter I don't disappear. I'll gladly wipe away your tears. But I'll never become your teddybear</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't throw this away. I'm no teddybear</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm here. You've got me. Have no fear. Savior that's me. No favors that's no what I came for. If you had any idea what I've got in store</segment5>
		<segment6>You called out my name. I heard you. You say I'm feeling fine. You say no deal. But I'll always be two steps behind. In case you change your mind. In your cry I'll always be near. But in your laughter I don't disappear. I'll gladly wipe away your tear. But I'll never become your teddybear</segment6>
		<segment7>Think through whatever you decide to do. Can't make you but I ask you please don't fake. When you come before me. I know you don't like when you don't see me with your physical eyes. But I tell you what you think you see can be lies    </segment7>
