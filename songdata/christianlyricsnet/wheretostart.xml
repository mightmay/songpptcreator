		<segment1>With every action a reaction. But these formulas don't work with you. I trust myself with myself. But there's just no hope for me to make it through. It's only something you can do </segment1>
		<segment2>I am not the answer. Always caught in my disasters. But you, you know me by heart. I am ready if you're willing. To make this more than just a feeling. 'Cause you know me by my heart. Just show me where to start </segment2>
		<segment3>Am I able or unstable. Can you tell me what this life is all about. Can you trust me; am I worthy?. 'Cause sometimes it's just so hard to figure out. Will you clear my head of every doubt?. (chorus) </segment3>
		<segment4>Make more this time to take this further. I can hear you calling. I am ready. Make me more this time to take this further. I can hear you calling. I am ready. I am ready    </segment4>
