		<segment1>Missing you, my brother. Spaced out miles between us. I remember when we sat on the shore. We talked about my great white north.</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll see you soon and we will laugh (we will laugh out loud). At how far we have come (we will spin the wheel of time around)</segment2>
		<segment3>My alcoholic afternoons and sleepless Prozac nights. Clouds of smoke around us. I miss you and your Lancaster ways.</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll see you soon and we will laugh (we will laugh out loud). At how far we have come (we will spin the wheel of time around). I'll see you soon and we will laugh (we will laugh out loud). At how far we have come (we will spin the wheel of time around)</segment4>
		<segment5>. I sit to contemplate the waves of the ocean. They bring me back to you.</segment5>
		<segment6>You weren't like the others. With their empty eyes and plastic smiles. You weren't like the others. With their empty eyes and plastic smiles.     </segment6>
