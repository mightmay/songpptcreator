		<segment1>I left my heart in a plastic box on the bedside table. It will be locked til I get home. Ive grown feeble and tired of the world, and. Tired of constantly missing my girl. And I long to smell the sea. I long to smell the sea. The sea</segment1>
		<segment2>I miss the pacific ocean and the northwestern air. And to run each of my fingers through the strands of her hair. Ive been all over this country lately. But Ive been nowhere it seems, no where. Well Ive found the cure for my landlocked blues</segment2>
		<segment3>Its coming home to you. Its coming home to you</segment3>
		<segment4>If a simple seed gets just what it needs. Then a redwood tree can grow. Up to a hundred feet for the world to see. And endure the sleet and the snow. But if my whole life was wrapped and priced. I wonder what the tag would show. Cause every time Im close to the holy ghost. I always seem to let her go. I let her go. I let her go     </segment4>
