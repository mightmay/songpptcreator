		<segment1>Seeing is believing. But belief is not like faith. Faith takes chances. Faith moves mountains. You will see when you dont see. That faith prevails where belief fails. It needs no proof, baby you dont need proof </segment1>
		<segment2>. You play it safe thats why youre running away. You play it safe cause you think its ok. Yea Yea. You play it safe thats why youre running away. You play it safe cause you think its ok. Yea Yea </segment2>
		<segment3>You claim to be searching. But just want to be down without a fight. No one seeks God, no, not one. God will be, though belief fails. Love prevails where passion fails. No one seeks God, no, not one </segment3>
		<segment4> You play it safe thats why youre running away. You play it safe cause you think its ok. Yea Yea. You play it safe thats why youre running away. You play it safe cause you think its ok. Yea Yea </segment4>
		<segment5>Our nature plays with fire. Burning bridges that made us stronger. Dont play it safe, fall in love with. The honest conviction.     </segment5>
