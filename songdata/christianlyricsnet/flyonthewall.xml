		<segment1>The other night.  I had a dream.  There was a world full of kings and queens.  But it was cold.  Dark as the night.  We were the fire on the moonlit skies</segment1>
		<segment2> We weren't divided.  We were the same.  And we were free.  But we all wore chains.  We couldn't see it.  But we created.  A place between truth and overrated</segment2>
		<segment3> If I could just see it all.  Just like a fly on the wall.  Would I be able to accept what I can't control?.  And would I share what I saw?.  Or just sit back and ignore.  Like nothing never happened,  I haven't seen you before?</segment3>
		<segment4> I'm on the run from a thief.  I let into my head.  I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared.  When I turn and shout:</segment4>
		<segment5> I don't think I need you anymore.  Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!.  I don't think I need you anymore.  Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!</segment5>
		<segment6> I wanna live, I wanna be the change.  We can all be kings and queens.  If we can just learn to believe.  If we can just learn to believe</segment6>
		<segment7> We had a plan to build a wall.  A great divide that would never fall.  To separate us.  From all the pain.  And keep our skeletons locked away</segment7>
		<segment8> And brick by brick.  We built it so thick.  That it blacked out the sky and all the sunlight.  And one by one.  We all became numb.  We were making the bullets to a broken gun</segment8>
		<segment9> If I could just see it all.  Just like a fly on the wall.  Would I be able to accept what I can't control?.  And would I share what I saw?.  Or just sit back and ignore.  Like nothing never happened.  And I haven't seen you before?</segment9>
		<segment10> I'm on the run from a thief.  I let into my head.  I know, I hold the keys, so don't be scared.  When I turn and shout:</segment10>
		<segment11> I don't think I need you anymore.  Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!.  I don't think I need you anymore.  Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it</segment11>
		<segment12> I wanna live, I wanna be the change.  We can all be kings and queens.  If we can just learn to believe.  If we can just learn to believe</segment12>
		<segment13> I don't think I need you anymore.  Take your words, and your lies and just beat it!.  I don't think I need you anymore.  Take the hurt and the pain, I don't need it!</segment13>
		<segment14> I wanna live, I wanna be the change.  We can all be kings and queens.  If we can just learn to believe.  If we can just learn to believe..    </segment14>
