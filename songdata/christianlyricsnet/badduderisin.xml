		<segment1>I see a bad dude arisin';. I see the devil on the way. I see a master of disguises;. I see the world led astray. Don't fall for the lies 'cause he's just a fake, not Christ. There's a bad dude on the rise.  I read in Second Thessalonians;. I know the man is comin' soon. He'll set himself upon the throne.  and he'll get the world to play his tune. Don't get all surprised 'cause he comes before the Christ. First the bad dude must arise.  He'll bring the countries all together. They'll see his miracles and signs. They'll think this world is gettin' better. They'll find he's really anti-Christ.     </segment1>
