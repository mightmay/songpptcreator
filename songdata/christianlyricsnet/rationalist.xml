		<segment1>See yourself to the exit. We can't afford to watch you resort to this (resort to this). Even hope hides in the shadows. Nothing is real. Color is black, is white, is color blind. Tucking away what's true, what's tangible. Nothing is real. Color is black, is white, is color blind. Tucking away what's true, what's tangible.. You're crashing faster, and there won't be pieces to piece back together this time. Can't you see you're ringing? You're ringing out. This is dissonance. This is dissonance. It's in the quiet of this place.. (This is dissonance.) ..that all things come to life. (This is dissonance). All that is real is blurred by your notion of reality. All that is real is blurred by your notion of reality. Nothing is real. Color is black, is white, is color blind. Tucking away what's true, what's tangible. Nothing is real. Color is black, is white, is color blind. Tucking away what's true, what's tangible. You skeptic, you. You believe in unbelief. You skeptic, you. Now you're the hypocrite. You can't hide from this. You can't hide from..You can't hide from this. You can't hide from this.    </segment1>
