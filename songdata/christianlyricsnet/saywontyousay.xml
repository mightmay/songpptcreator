		<segment1>Say won't You say. Say that You love me. with love, ever, love, love everlasting?. All my devotion put into motion by You</segment1>
		<segment2>Every morning I. have a chance to rise and give my all. but every afternoon I find I have only wasted time. In light of Your awe. Isn't love amazing, I forgot how to speak. knowing You are near and I am finally free</segment2>
		<segment3>My eyes fear to close. this reckless letting go is hard to bear. on the edge of all I need, still I cling to what I see. and what have I there?. Bred my own disaster, who have I to blame?. When all I need is waiting to be fanned to flame</segment3>
		<segment4>I opened up my eyes to see You standing there. Oh I can barely breathe, and I can hardly bear. All the love that I feel for You inside. I hope You feel it now, some,somehow </segment4>
		<segment5>.     </segment5>
