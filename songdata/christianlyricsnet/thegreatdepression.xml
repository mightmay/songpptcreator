		<segment1>We are the sons and daughters of a revolution. Revolutionaries walking us out of oppression and into a no-law promised land. Where there is no right or wrong</segment1>
		<segment2>And this leaves us with a great sense of sadness growing inside our soul. No one can explain where it's coming from. Or where it's taking us</segment2>
		<segment3>We just know that something is lost</segment3>
		<segment4>That somehow we are lost</segment4>
		<segment5>And this, my friend, is the great depression    </segment5>
