		<segment1>How do you think I felt, that I made up for all your mistakes?. You never think of consequences, carelessly destructive, you fall down. I can see you sitting there. Wish that you could see yourself. I wish I knew what was going on inside, I'd just be sickened more. Why don't you open your eyes?. You're not all you think you are. Your selfishness is getting on my nerves. Why don't you go away. Forgetting all that you've been taught, is this the way you treat your friends?. I've dealt with you for long enough. When will it end?. I hope that this is just a phase. I'll be there for you in the end. I'll be there when you finally come around. but for nowand don't come back. Have you ever know what you were looking for?    </segment1>
