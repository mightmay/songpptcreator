		<segment1>wasted, paralyzed. beneath ten thousand layers of disguise. built to save. what's left that has already worn away</segment1>
		<segment2>inside the vacant made-up plastic life. only your heart survived. for one last cry. how long. must I always remember all that I won't forget. until it's my day to die. these broken animals. useless as they are</segment2>
		<segment3>gravity gets to me. holds me here without release. now's the time to cut the line</segment3>
		<segment4>cross my heart. i realize nights are long when hope is gone. God help me make it home (this time)    </segment4>
