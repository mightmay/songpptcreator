		<segment1>She won't falter easy. She'll be careful, she'll be coy. But still she paints her heart. Among the musings of a boy </segment1>
		<segment2>If You find her. Tell her that I love her. If she hears You. Ask her heart to come </segment2>
		<segment3>At the break of morning. The day awaits her when she sleeps. Deep inside her dreams is all. The beauty that she keeps.     </segment3>
