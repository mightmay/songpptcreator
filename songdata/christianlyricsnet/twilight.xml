		<segment1>Once upon a time. When we were young. We thought wed escape from it all. But we were wrong. Then unexpectedly. Were in a dream. So faintly we didnt notice. Or did we?. Enter the other side. It sounds like a lullaby. In this twilight. We are pale. On this frail side. Nothing else could be so real. Is it nostalgia?. Is it the sun?. Cause it wont leave us alone. And were still young. When we sat down to pray. If you saw my eyes. Youd know I just couldnt close them. Not all night. Enter to the other side. It sounds like a lullaby. In this twilight. We are pale. On this frail side. Nothing else could be so real    </segment1>
