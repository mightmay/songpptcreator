		<segment1>I lived a lot of life. I caught a dream or two. It's been a sweet ride</segment1>
		<segment2>But I've faced my share of nights. Searched like we all do. Looking inside</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I'm standing here. 'Cause You've made it clear</segment3>
		<segment4>This heart inside me beats because. You loved enough to take my cross. I'm alive. You gave Your life to shatter death. So even after my last breath. I'm alive. I'm finally wide awake. I'm finished being know. It's a new day</segment4>
		<segment5>I feel it on my face. In hope's a midnight sun. That won't fade</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm bowing down. And I'm crying out</segment6>
		<segment7>This heart inside me beats because. You loved enough to take my cross. I'm alive. You gave Your life to shatter death. So even after my last breath. I'm alive</segment7>
		<segment8>Forever, forevermore. Forever, Lord.     </segment8>
