		<segment1>It's the smallest things. That have a tendency to hurt for the longest time. It's like you found a way inside</segment1>
		<segment2>This time I'm not going to follow you down. I'll fall in love with the sound. So push me back and I'll stay the same. And fall in love with the sound of silence</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm armed but the gun is not loaded. I guess I could find my way out of this. But it's like you found a way inside. And I hate that I suspect you're right</segment3>
		<segment4>But this time I'm not going to follow you down. I'll fall in love with the sound. So push me back and I'll stay the same. And fall in love with the sound of silence</segment4>
		<segment5>Silence is golden but golden teeth are so much sharper. It's not easy but I'm biting my tongue off</segment5>
		<segment6>Even though you're right. Your words lie</segment6>
		<segment7>This time I'm not going to follow you down. I'll fall in love with the sound. So push me back and I'll stay the same. And fall in love with the sound of silence    </segment7>
