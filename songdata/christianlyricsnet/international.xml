		<segment1>Verse 1: I have traveled in all directions. From Perisa to Siam, Climbed the highest mountain, Walked across the burning sand. </segment1>
		<segment2>I've been accepted by perfect strangers. Who never knew my name, But in the name of Jesus. They've always held a welcome hand. </segment2>
		<segment3>I can tell you. It's everything I thought. It would be. I've been sheltered, But even sheltered eyes. Can see, So I can tell you... </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: The greates words are. The words unspoken, Words don't matter at all. 'cause when we speak. With he heart of Jesus. It's the language of love. And it's international. </segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 2: True love and compassion. Know no boundaries, Forgiveness needs no name, The love of God is language, The love of God is always. The same. </segment5>
		<segment6>I could tell you, But the words I speak. Just might come out wrong. Let me show you. And let the words just. Come from my heart, I can tell you. </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus:...    </segment7>
