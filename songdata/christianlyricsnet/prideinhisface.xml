		<segment1>He walks on the clouds, He is as close as a brother is, He's never been knocked down, unlike any other. Pride in his face, his mind is sound, he's found an escape, from being knocked down. Can't take away all the memories that haunt him, He's been disowned, by the ones that love him, this world can hurt you bring you to your knees. You've got to find your way back home. Nowhere else to roam. He walks the streets, he walks far from home, he's got tears on his cheeks, Walking away from the unknown.     </segment1>
