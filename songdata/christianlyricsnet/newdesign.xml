		<segment1>Wait, I might hesitate. Am I a minute too late?. Please Lord, I need to know. This pressure's got me lettin' go. If I'm wrong, will I still carry on. And end up where I belong? </segment1>
		<segment2>BRIDGE. I've never felt this way before. I've never come so close. I've never worn so thin. I'm stepping out. Instead of closing in. Left myself behind. When I made up my mind. No turnin' back this time. This is my new design </segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Sometimes I feel so alone. It feels like I'm standing out here on my own. I've never felt so far from home. It's comin' on, it hits me. When I step outside my zone. Cause sometimes, I feel so alone. It feels like I'm standing out here on my own. I've never felt so far from home. It's comin' on, it hits me. When I step outside my zone </segment3>
		<segment4>I see what you're doin' to me. Could have been you so easily. You look the other way. Even though we were close the other day. And I'm still tryin' to get up this hill. I need you just like a pill </segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS </segment6>
		<segment7>Do you get the feelin'. Everything will be alright?. I'm movin'. So pleased to meet you. But I am movin' on. Tried to pass it to another. But it's comin' on. I can't wait to find out. Break me, can't seem to climb out. Of this hole, I'm stuck again. If I'm not out in a minute I'm jumpin' in. Let's start again. I'm sick of this. Let's just get it out. Are ya feelin' it?. Move back. Ya wanna feel how real it is. Let's just get it out. Are ya feelin' it?. Move back. Ya wanna feel how real it is </segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS     </segment8>
