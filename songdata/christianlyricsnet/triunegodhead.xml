Well, in Acts 3:26, it says the Father was the one who raised the Son. But what do you think of this?. John 2:19 says it was Jesus. Romans 8:11 says it was the Spirit. I can't forget those! No no no! Hey hey hey!.  That's what it says God was at the Earth's creation .. In Colossians 1:16, well, it calls the Son creator. but the Spirit was on the scene in Genesis 1:2 'n'. the same verse in Hebrews says the Father made everything. I can't forget those! No no no! Hey hey hey!. That's what it says God was at the Great Commission. God was at the Lord's baptism .. When He sent 'em out into the world. in Matthew 28 he said baptize in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. And Luke 3:21 it says that there was all three when Jesus was baptized, you see I can't forget those! No no no! Hey hey hey! That's what it says.     </segment1>
