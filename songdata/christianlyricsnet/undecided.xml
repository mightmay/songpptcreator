		<segment1>drink down what i want to be. and ever from a glass that is half empty. down to my last dime, as such. and optimism costs too much. now seeing double it seems. under the influence of these dreams. the outcome too early to tell. but it isn't going very well. so i stagger on. but if this keeps up. it won't be long. till i'm forced to choose. how much time can i loose?. but i'm not ready. to trade in my dream. for security. so i won't be bought. not when i've got a shot. someone tell me what to do. anyone who cares, anyone will do. or i'll put everything on the shelf. and sit here and absorb myself.     </segment1>
