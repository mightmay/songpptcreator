		<segment1>So we try and try all of our life working. with such pride making cash just to survive. as we race and grade and judge away other folks mistakes. makes us good to feel that way. And don't you know, it never stops. Try to please the world and beat the ticking clocks, but I, I'm not letting it happen this time.</segment1>
		<segment2>No no because if you don't fail, and reach your bail, I feel so secure when I'm in this jail, but I, I'm not letting it happen this time</segment2>
		<segment3>So I'll move to the other side of the block. so we wont ever have to stop making the rounds, having the laughs. singing the sounds of relaxing, and on the other side. of the clock the power switch will be off and all will be well and. time will stand still, and I will be locked out from my jail.    </segment3>
