		<segment1>There is a part of me. That's only visiting. Torn from eternity. A stranger here</segment1>
		<segment2>The awkward mingling of. The loveless and beloved. So far from things above. While I am here</segment2>
		<segment3>So when the last notes of my soul's summer symphony. Go stealing through this old world's cold garden gates. I will hold no fear as You close my book of hours. And the hands of heaven carry me. Carry me home to stay</segment3>
		<segment4>O Death where is your sting. Your tears and your tremblings. His peace is lingering. Even now</segment4>
		<segment5>O Grave the battle's fought (no graver battles fought). Your vict'ry has been lost. To Christ who gave it all. To take me now</segment5>
		<segment6>(Love, love, love, love)     </segment6>
