		<segment1>In my head I have dreams. I have visions of many things. Questions, longins in my mind</segment1>
		<segment2>Pictures fill my head. I feel so trapped instead but. Trapped doesn't seem so bad. 'Cause You are here</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>It doesn't mean anything. Without You here with me. And I can try to justify. But I still need You here with me. In my heart I had hope. Built on dreams I'll never know. Answers to love left behind</segment4>
		<segment5>Visions filled my head. I feel so trapped instead but. Trapped doesn't seem so bad. 'Cause You were near</segment5>
		<segment6>I can't do anything without You. You give me strength to do anything. I can't be everything I try to. You saved me from the everything. I couldn't be</segment6>
		<segment7>Need You here with me. I need You here with me.     </segment7>
