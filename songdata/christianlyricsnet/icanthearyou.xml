		<segment1>Through the noise of the street. And the screams inside my head. I don't seem to find peace. Through the words that you have said</segment1>
		<segment2>The traffic's constant pulse through the rush of pouring rain. Make me crave for a moment. When I can hear you speak again</segment2>
		<segment3>Running round like I need to break free. Come to me like I need you to be</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't hear you. No matter how hard I try. I can't hear you. I know that you'll hear my cry</segment4>
		<segment5>Longing for the hush. That escapes me every day. Need to break through it all. But there seems no easy way</segment5>
		<segment6>Fortress all around me. Sound walls moving in. Desperate just to you hear you. Through an ever increasing din    </segment6>
