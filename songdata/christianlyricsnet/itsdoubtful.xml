		<segment1>On the back of a string of rough luck. Get a look at me now. Get a look at me now</segment1>
		<segment2>Did you notice I already gave up?. Could you say it somehow?. Could you say it somehow?</segment2>
		<segment3>I give what I can't take. Like an unmanned army. So if my back should break. Just pretend you never met me</segment3>
		<segment4>If I'm happy, there's a good chance. I'm lying through my teeth. 'Cause without you it's doubtful</segment4>
		<segment5>And it would take a miracle I know. To set this straight. And give back the hours that I stole. 'Cause without you it's doubtful</segment5>
		<segment6>You couldn't wait for me to turn it around. Wasted half of your life, such a very long time. It seems I'm only good at letting you down. By the look in your eyes, by the look in your eyes</segment6>
		<segment7>I give what I can't take. Like an unmanned army. So if my back should break. Just pretend you never met me</segment7>
		<segment8>If I'm happy, there's a good chance. I'm lying through my teeth. 'Cause without you it's doubtful</segment8>
		<segment9>And it would take a miracle I know. To set this straight. And give back the hours that I stole. 'Cause without you it's doubtful</segment9>
		<segment10>If I'm happy, there's a good chance. I'm lying through my teeth. 'Cause without you it's doubtful</segment10>
		<segment11>And it would take a miracle I know. To set this straight. And give back the hours that I stole. 'Cause without you it's doubtful</segment11>
		<segment12>On the back of a string of rough luck. Get a look at me now. Get a look at me now.      </segment12>
