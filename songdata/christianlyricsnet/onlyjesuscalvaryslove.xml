		<segment1>Only Jesus, Only He. Brings redemption, full and free. There's a yearning, in all our lives. That only Jesus satisfies</segment1>
		<segment2>Calvary's love will sail forever. Bright and shining, strong and free. Like an ark of peace and safety. On the sea of human need</segment2>
		<segment3>Through the hours of all the ages. Those tired of sailing on their own. Finally rest inside the shadow. Cast by Calvary's love across their souls</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: Calvary's love, Calvary's love. Priceless gift Christ makes us worthy of. The deepest sin can't rise above. Calvary's love</segment4>
		<segment5>Calvary's love can heal the Spirit. Life has crushed and cast aside. And redeem til Heaven's promise. Fills with joy once empty eyes. So desire to tell His story. Of a love that loved enough to die. Burns away all other passions. And fed by Calvary's love becomes a fire</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Calvary's love has never faltered. All its wonders still remain. Souls still take eternal passage. Sins atoned and heaven gained. Sins forgiven and heaven gained    </segment7>
