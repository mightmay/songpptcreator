		<segment1>Island life in the sun. Tryin' to hide from everyone. Livin' a life that pleases you. Big walls that hide you. Where were you those days &quot; Wooooo. When love called, you were away &quot; Wooooo. You know people lost yeh. Bring down those walls yeh</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Its time to make a stand, get up, get up. Its time to take the land. Get up, get up for love</segment2>
		<segment3>Island life in the sun tryin' to hide from everyone. Livin' a life that pleases you, big walls that hide you. Friends lost with hell to pay &quot; Woooo. Will you let them go that way. People caught by death yeh &quot; Woooo. Do you love the lost yeh &quot; Woooo</segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus -</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. The devil comes to rob and to steal. Secret believer, believe me it's real</segment5>
		<segment6>- Chorus -    </segment6>
