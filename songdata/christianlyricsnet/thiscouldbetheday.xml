		<segment1>The Earth will be filled with His glory&amp;#8232;. Like the water covers the sea&amp;#8232;. And today is just one more day closer to&amp;#8232;. Every tribe, nation, and creed. Joining as one to praise His name&amp;#8232;. Let's sing and dance and raise our hands&amp;#8232;. 'Cause we know what's coming</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Hallelujah, this could be the day&amp;#8232;. Hallelujah, so we come here to celebrate</segment2>
		<segment3>The ends of the earth will acknowledge and turn&amp;#8232;. To the Lord our God when the trumpets are heard&amp;#8232;. While the rest of the world is caught by surprise&amp;#8232;. His people will rejoice for their time has arrived. Let's all join together and praise His name&amp;#8232;. We'll sing and dance and raise our hands&amp;#8232;. 'Cause we know what's coming</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus x3)    </segment4>
