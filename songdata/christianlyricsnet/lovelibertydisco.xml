		<segment1>and if i told you there's somebody who loves you. would you say, &quot;hey, show me that face&quot;. and if i told you that true freedom was actual. would you say, &quot;hey, take me to that place?&quot;. and if i said, &quot;there is a family. a body that moves as one&quot;. do you feel the LOVE that invites us. LIBERTY excites us. the DISCO has just begun, has just begun </segment1>
		<segment2>give me love, give me liberty, disco. the place everybody in the family's found. on that day we will all be happy people. when love, liberty, disco's in town </segment2>
		<segment3>and as we step into the light of the lover. we're all the same, there's no rich or poor. and you know it's never been good for a man to be alone. so come on in, your name's on the door. what are we waiting for </segment3>
		<segment4>all our fears are turning 'round. fall down, and meet your maker. where our true selves will be found. calling out to every lonely soul    </segment4>
