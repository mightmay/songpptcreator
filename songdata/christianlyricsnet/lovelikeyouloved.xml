		<segment1>Help me to love like You loved. Serve like You served. To speak only words of truth. Help me to care like You cared. For a world in despair. Help me to love like You</segment1>
		<segment2>What I'd give for a change. How long will it be this way</segment2>
		<segment3>This complacency is wearing on me. All my passions turned to apathy. I could get up and follow You. And find my faith from before. Don't know what I'm waiting for</segment3>
		<segment4>I have done what I thought I should. All these years that I've spent serving You. Tell me how did I end up like this. With doubt in my heart and my hands in a fist</segment4>
		<segment5>Maybe You shining white or a blood red sun. Maybe some other sign that may never come. Maybe I must believe before I can see. What I'm waiting for     </segment5>
