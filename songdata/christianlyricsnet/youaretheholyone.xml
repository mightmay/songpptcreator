		<segment1>I will live to declare Your glory. And my heart is filled with praise. I will shout and I will sing. For all of my days. Wanna walk in Your holiness. Wanna stand for all Your ways. When You call I will say yes. For all of my days</segment1>
		<segment2>Wanna die so You can live. Resurrect my heart again. I will tell the world. That You are the Holy One. You are the Holy One. And I worship Your name. You are the Holy One. And I stand amazed. You are the Holy One    </segment2>
