		<segment1>revolution. revolt not by your worldly nature, put it into my hands and wait and see. i'll bring the authority to it's knees, through Christ who strengthens me. but the public school and community have organized to defeat me, through conformity and worldliness, a fascist dictatorship. but i've been crucified with Christ, and Christ lives within me. so little do they know while they brainwash our youth, our soldiers have equipped. we've disabled the front lines with truth for the masses, today is the day that we fight back. not you, nor satan, nor death itself.. has one ounce of power over me.ressors, and they had no comfort whatsoever, everything, everything, everything is meaningless, everything, everything, everything is meaningless, and i declare that the dead, who have already died, are happier than those who are still alive    </segment1>
