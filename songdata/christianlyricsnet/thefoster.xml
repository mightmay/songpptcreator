		<segment1>The wisest words I ever heard. Came with a gentle wind. Though it didnt hit me then. It made no sound. Til no one was around. This it blew me to my knees. And handed me the keys</segment1>
		<segment2>Go, just go where the peace is. You always know if you seek it. Go, just go where the peace is. You always know if you seek it</segment2>
		<segment3>I know the truth. I can show it to you. Or anybody else. But cant apply it to myself. I already know which way to go. If I stop and breathe the air. The answer is right there</segment3>
		<segment4>Go, just go where the peace is. You always know if you seek it. Go, just go where the peace is. You always know if you seek it</segment4>
		<segment5>You can fight. You can try with all your might. It may be the hardest thing. But its the only way to peace</segment5>
		<segment6>Close your eyes. Count to ten. Take a deep breath and try again</segment6>
		<segment7>You have access. By one Spirit (Ephesians 2:18)</segment7>
		<segment8>Go, just go where the peace is. You always know if you seek it. Go, just go where the peace is. You always know if you seek it    </segment8>
