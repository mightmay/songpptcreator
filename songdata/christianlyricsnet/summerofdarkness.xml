		<segment1>I'll be the one last breath before this death. I'll be the final glimpse of truth when there's none left. And if I shame your face, degrade your faith. I'll be the first to hide behind disgrace. Blood loss on account of my failing aim. Treason - at the root of my shameful name. . I found my way to fall. I never meant to break your heart. . CHORUS: Breathing in this pain (rejecting all I am). I hear you cry again (Is this my final stand?).     </segment1>
