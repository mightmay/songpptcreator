		<segment1>I come on my knees. To lay down before you. Bringing all that I am. Longing only to know you. Seeking your face. And not only your hand. I find you embracing me. Just as I am</segment1>
		<segment2>And I lift these songs. To you and you alone. As I sing to you. In my praises make your home</segment2>
		<segment3>To my audience of one. You are Father, and you are Son. As your spirit flows free, Let it find within me. A heart that beats to praise you. And now just to know you more. Has become my great reward. To see your kingdom come. And your will be done. I only desire to be yours, Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>So what could I bring. To honor your majesty. What song could I sing. That would move the heart of royalty. And all that I have. Is the life that you've given me. So Lord let me live for you. My song with humility</segment4>
		<segment5>And Lord as the love song. Of my life is played. I have one desire. To bring glory to your name</segment5>
		<segment6>To my audience of one. You are Father, and you are Son. As your spirit flows free, Let it find within me. A heart that beats to praise you. And now just to know you more. Has become my great reward. To see your kingdom come. And your will be done. I only desire to be yours, Lord</segment6>
		<segment7>And we lift these songs. To you and you alone. As we sing to you. In our praises make your home</segment7>
		<segment8>To my audience of one. You are Father, and you are Son. As your spirit flows free, Let it find within me. A heart that beats to praise you. And now just to know you more. Has become my great reward. To see your kingdom come. And your will be done. I only desire to be yours, Lord    </segment8>
