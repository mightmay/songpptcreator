		<segment1>Lord I give myself. I trust in You mighty God. My Saviour. And Your mercy and love. Overflows and my soul rejoices. Lord show me Your ways. Guide my steps. Lead me to Your righteousness. And the light of Your love. Takes my fear away. 'Cause I know You walk before me. Oh my shepherd. You let me rest in Your arms. You comfort me. And everywhere that I go. I'm not alone. Mighty God. I know You're with me    </segment1>
