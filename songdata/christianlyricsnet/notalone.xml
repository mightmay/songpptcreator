		<segment1>Slowly fading away. Youre lost and so afraid. Where is the hope in a world so cold. Looking for a distant light. Someone who can save a life. Youre living in fear that no one will hear your cry. Can you save me now?</segment1>
		<segment2>I am with you. I will carry you through it all. I wont leave you, I will catch you. When you feel like letting go. Cause youre not, youre not alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Your heart is full of broken dreams. Just a fading memory. And everythings gone, but the pain carries on. Lost in the rain again. When will it ever end?. The arms of relief seem so out of reach. But I, I am here</segment3>
		<segment4>I am with you. I will carry you through it all. I wont leave you, I will catch you. When you feel like letting go. Cause youre not, youre not alone</segment4>
		<segment5>And I will be your hope. When you feel like its over. And I will pick you up. When your whole world shatters. And when youre finally in my arms. Look up and see, love has a face</segment5>
		<segment6>I am with you. I will carry you through it all. I wont leave you, I will catch you. When you feel like letting go. Cause youre not, youre not alone</segment6>
		<segment7>And I will be your hope. (Youre not alone). And I will pick you up. And I will be your hope. And I will be your hope</segment7>
		<segment8>Slowly fading away. Youre lost and so afraid. Where is the hope in a world so cold?    </segment8>
