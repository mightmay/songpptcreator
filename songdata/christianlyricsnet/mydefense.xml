		<segment1>Dont put all Your hopes in this flesh. This flesh, this mess I am. Empty promises my steady diet. Wont be quiet till I. Spread so thin devotion. Thus far my notions rant. Dont put all Your hopes. Dont put all Your trust in me. You must not see I cant</segment1>
		<segment2>Set the sights on failing. Target no control. Grips relax and lose hold</segment2>
		<segment3>I lose my defense at Your answers. And I come all undone with Your gaze</segment3>
		<segment4>Sunless skies this progress. Thicker skin cant stretch the length. Wearying with face set against the elements. Is how I spent my strength</segment4>
		<segment5>Set the sights on failing. Target no control. Grips relax and lose hold</segment5>
		<segment6>I lose my defense at Your answers. And I come all undone with Your gaze. I lose my defense at Your answers. And my resolve at Your counter ways</segment6>
		<segment7>I cant run forever. With the lions loose on me. Show us no escape. Lest we forget were dying. Fill my mind with Your thoughts. My lungs with Your breath. My mouth with Your words. My soul with Your death</segment7>
		<segment8>I lose my defense at Your answers. And I come all undone with Your gaze. I lose my defense at Your answers. And my resolve at Your counter ways    </segment8>
