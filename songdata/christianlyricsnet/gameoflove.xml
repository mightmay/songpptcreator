		<segment1>when i was young You fed me -. before I claimed Your name -. the words You softly told me -. still in my heart today - </segment1>
		<segment2>to think that I'm your favorite -. to think that I'm Your son - </segment2>
		<segment3>my faith in You grows stronger -. breeds deeper everyday -. to think that Your my father -. Your blood runs through my veins - </segment3>
		<segment4>to hear You say &quot; This ones mine&quot; -. to hear You say &quot;He's my son&quot; - </segment4>
		<segment5>I hear Your voice speak to me -. even when I don't call -. I feel Your strength run through me -. even when I've done wrong - </segment5>
		<segment6>pieces of You inside of us -. inside our hearts burns Your love -. pieces of You inside of me -. to think that I'm Your favorite - </segment6>
		<segment7>game of love - I'll play this game of love - I won't lose.    </segment7>
