		<segment1>I heard youre on a witchhunt here tonight. Desperate to reclaim those limelight heights. But oh I cant believe the envy cocktails you consume. and now you condescend to take me for a fool</segment1>
		<segment2>Rescue me. Separate my desires. Capture these wicked men and release my mind </segment2>
		<segment3>So summon those ghosts and try with all your might. The past is obsolete and you will find how. That chip with which you operate like someone owes you for your greatness. is the very thing that steals your hearts desires..</segment3>
		<segment4>Vicious men with vile ways. so envious in all their days. What will it take to demonstrate. Celebrity breeds infamy</segment4>
		<segment5>Deliver me. Liberate us from envy. Reconcile every heart and destroy my pride</segment5>
		<segment6>You come at me with villainy. In every sense its irony. Because the very act of jealousy. Has sealed yourself to slavery</segment6>
		<segment7>Fame is infamy    </segment7>
