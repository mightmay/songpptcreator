		<segment1>How she sees corresponds with what she knows, And they only see with their eyes what they wanted. Bitterly in being judged by Pharisees, They only see with their eyes what they wanted. So were supposed to raise their righteous hands and say goodnight?. And leave her with the bitter taste of church inside?. She wanted just to see inside, She wanted just to know whats right, She wanted her life to be all right.</segment1>
		<segment2>How she sees corresponds with what she feels, And they only see with their eyes what they wanted. So beat her down because shes a whore anyway, You foolish man you forget your chains. So do me a favor - raise those filthy hands that mercy claimed. Remember love that showed you life, then show the same. She wanted just to see inside, She wanted just to know whats right, She wanted her life to be all right. If she could only see, shes just like you and me.    </segment2>
