		<segment1>Tired again, when will it turn around?. Wound up tight and ready to unwind. Turn it around one more time. It's getting older each and every day. I found the other way to go now. The sun sets tomorrow but I won't be there. I'll let you know, before I go, without you. All alone, by myself to escape the bitter tongue. Behind my back they're talking trash. And I don't even care. The sun sets tomorrow but I won't be there. I don't know what happened, too much has changed.     </segment1>
