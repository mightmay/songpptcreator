		<segment1>Your words they never spoke so clear to me. The way they did that day. I always dreamed we'd be forever. I always thought it'd be ok. I took for granted all you gave me. I never thought you'd go away. Was this not love that we were sharing. I thought love never went away</segment1>
		<segment2>Say goodbye to memories. Cause I have said so long. Say goodbye to all our dreams. It's time now to</segment2>
		<segment3>I see now this is where our story ends. So just move on I'm told. Today I loved someone for three years. Tomorrow learn to just let go. To have your best friend always be there. Then one day to see her go. My world is falling all around me. And girl your all I know</segment3>
		<segment4>Say goodbye to memories. Cause I have said so long. Say goodbye to all our dreams. It's time now to move on</segment4>
		<segment5>And on and on I've tried to. Let go. My mind can not forget you. You're all I know</segment5>
		<segment6>Say goodbye to memories. Cause I have said so long. Say goodbye to all our dreams. It's time now to move on    </segment6>
