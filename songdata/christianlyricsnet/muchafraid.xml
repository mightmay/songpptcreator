		<segment1>Empty again. Sunken down so far. So scared to fall. I might not get up again </segment1>
		<segment2>So I lay at your feet. All my brokenness. I carry all of my burdens to you </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: All of these things. I've held up in vain. No reason nor rhyme. Just the scars that remain. Of all of these things. I'm so much afraid. Scared out of my mind. By the demons I've made. Sweet Jesus, you never ever let me go. Oh, sweet Jesus, never ever let me go </segment3>
		<segment4>So happy to love. Yet so far to go. You lead me on to where I've never been before </segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus]     </segment5>
