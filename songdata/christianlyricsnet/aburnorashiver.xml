		<segment1>When we hear it we need to listen close. Yea we feel it, first a draft and then a wind. </segment1>
		<segment2>It will feel like a burn or a shiver. Yea we feel it. It's a pull to the earth. </segment2>
		<segment3>Like a hand on the top of your head. You feel safe here, you can dance here. There's a love that surrounds the room. It's a quiet sound that's screaming out. And we fall under the weight of glory. </segment3>
		<segment4>Can you hear it? A wave before it breaks?. Can you feel it? A calm before the storm? </segment4>
		<segment5>LetÂ’s keep this passion flowing. Like a child I wait for love    </segment5>
