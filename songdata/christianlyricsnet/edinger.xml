		<segment1>I woke her up cause I could barely sleep, At 2AM and contemplating faith. I made my way right out her door. The street lights, shine bright. I run away while she sleeps thorugh the night.</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Was it fate that brought us here. My mistakes I made in fear. Is it too late to change my mind?. Who have I been?</segment2>
		<segment3>Stepping back to where I used to be, Incomplete and helpless so it seems. The fog's like a wall, And it's hard to see. It's feelings' meanings. I start my car and drive 'til I found peace.</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus x2]</segment4>
		<segment5>Who have I been?. When will this end. Time's running thin. Figure it out. Figure it out</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus x2]</segment6>
		<segment7>Who have I been?. When will this end. Time's running thin. Figure it out. Figure it out.     </segment7>
