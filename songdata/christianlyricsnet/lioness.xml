		<segment1>Shes a god in her own right. She dims the room light. While she moves closer, we all move slower. Tracing white lines, sipping fine wines. We remember when purity wasnt dead. </segment1>
		<segment2>In this darkness I cant remember when we were stable, we were able. </segment2>
		<segment3>The sex is the lioness, queen of the temple. I look right in her eyes, then down to her level. </segment3>
		<segment4>Shell play unstable and let you get away. You get her faded, but not her name. Youve taken something sacred and made it a game. Your perversions are wicked and fanning the flame. </segment4>
		<segment5>In this darkness I cant remember when we were stable, we were able. In this darkness I cant remember when we were stable, no. </segment5>
		<segment6>The sex is the lioness, queen of the temple. I look right in her eyes, then down to her level. </segment6>
		<segment7>The sex is the lioness queen of the temple. I look right in her eyes, and then down to her level. The sex is the lioness queen of the temple. I look right in her eyes, and then down to her level. </segment7>
		<segment8>The sex is the liar. The sex is the liar. </segment8>
		<segment9>The sex is the lioness, queen of the temple. I look right in her eyes, then down to her level. </segment9>
		<segment10>The sex is the liar. The sex is the liar.     </segment10>
