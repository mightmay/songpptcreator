		<segment1>Cause I know that you're alive. You came to fix my broken life. And I'll sing to glorify. Your Holy name, Jesus Christ</segment1>
		<segment2>You bought my life with the blood. That you shed on the cross. When you died for the sins of men. And you let out a cry, crucified. Now alive in me</segment2>
		<segment3>These hands are yours. Teach them to serve. As you please and I'll reach out. Desperate to see all the greatness of God. May my soul rest assured in you</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll never be the same. No I'll never be the same. Cause I know that you're alive. You came to fix my broken life. And I'll sing to glorify. Your Holy name, Jesus Christ</segment4>
		<segment5>You've changed it all. You broke down the wall. When I spoke and confessed. In you I am blessed. Now I walk in the light. In victorious sight of you</segment5>
		<segment6>Fire fall down. Fire fall down. On us we pray. As we seek. Fire fall down. Your fire fall down. On us we pray</segment6>
		<segment7>Show me your heart. Show me your way. Show me your glory    </segment7>
