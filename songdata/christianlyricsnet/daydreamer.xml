		<segment1>Daydreamer dreams a dream of love. And finds none there. He's dreaming his life away. He says that lovers come. Lovers go and leave him there. He's never found anyone who really cares </segment1>
		<segment2>Daydreamer dreams a dream of love. For someone else. Never a dream of love for real. He says that life has come and gone. And passed him by. He doesn't know it's just a lie</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause dreams were made to give flight to wings. To bring hope in every part of you. Visions were meant to be lived, not just dreamt. To be brought out in the light. Freed from the night </segment3>
		<segment4>So daydreamer, lay it down. Let it go and touch the ground. Let the sweet earth kiss your feet. Dust to dust, ashes to ashes. All fall down. Life's a straight path of light. Not a merry-go-round    </segment4>
