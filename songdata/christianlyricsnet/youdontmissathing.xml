		<segment2>Seeking me. Reaching me. Keeping me in your care, lord. I can't escape it</segment2>
		<segment3>1st chorus: You don't miss a thing I do. You see every move I make. But you know everything I need. You don't let a care get by you. You don't miss a thing, do you?</segment3>
		<segment4>When my heart's broken. You dry my tears. 'cause you know what I'm feelin'. When I am frozen. You melt my fears. Your gentle love is healing. You feed my hunger. You quench my thirst. 'cause you are my provider</segment4>

		<segment6>2nd chorus: You don't miss a thing I do. You see every move I make. You know everything I need. You don't let a dare get by you. You hear every word I say. I will never go unnoticed. 'cause you don't miss a thing, do you?. (repeat)</segment6>
