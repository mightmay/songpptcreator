		<segment1>Packing up the dreams. God planted. In the fertile soil of you. I Can't believe the hopes He's granted. Means a chapter in your life is through </segment1>
		<segment2>But we'll keep you close as always. It won't even seem you've gone. Cause our hearts in big and small ways. Will keep the love that keeps us strong </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS]. And friends are friends forever. If the Lord's the Lord of them. And a friend will not say never. Cause the welcome will not end. Though it's hard to let you go. In the Father's hands we know. That a lifetime's not too long to live as friends. </segment3>
		<segment4>With the faith and love God's given. Springing from the hope we know. We will pray the joy you'll live in. Is the strength that now you show </segment4>
		<segment5>But we'll keep you close as always. It won't even seem you've gone. Cause our hearts in big and small ways. Will keep the love that keeps us strong </segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS 2x] </segment6>
		<segment7>That a lifetime's not too long. To live as friends (to live as friends). To live as friends     </segment7>
