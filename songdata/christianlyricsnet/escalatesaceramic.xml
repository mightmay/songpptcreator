		<segment1>This is everything that I wanted. Do you believe that I tried so hard to take it home. But never felt a single moment. Life has been a place where I've wandered. Moving slowly to understand what I can grasp. But understand that it's still not right</segment1>
		<segment2>So come back to me (he's always waiting)</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). I can't find it but maybe I'll cope. And can you hide it and never let go?. Come back to you, I only knew</segment3>
		<segment4>Lies have covered all of the smiles. And wakened thoughts that have turned my heart. To face the wind. And then fall to where I know I'll fit, but you. Do you believe that I wanted. Something other than fallen hearts that just. Belong. To places where the bridges give in</segment4>
		<segment5>Can you see what I felt when I told you. Can you cope when it runs right through you. Cause my heart it is broken with love that is. Coped. And now you tell me that I have something that's missing?    </segment5>
