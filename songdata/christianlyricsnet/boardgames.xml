		<segment1>Can't you see which way you're walking now. Opposite to hell is the place I wanna dwell in. Blind you cannot see it's in front of your face. It's a change to get to a better place</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus loves you someone said to you. Jesus sees you what you're up to. Jesus saves you if you wanna take. Him to live in your heart take him</segment2>
		<segment3>Shaking - your head is shaking. Breaking - your heart is breaking. Aching - your soul is aching. Faking - this is no boardgame. No</segment3>
		<segment4>Can't you see the sin you do now. Pretty soon find out no doubt. Can I call you Rita senorita. Gimme the blood of Christ a little bita    </segment4>
