		<segment1>Take back that photograph it breaks my heart. And I will wait by the telephone. While the silence pressures my eardrum. I found a black and white with a person smiling sad at me. Now I know can't get back that photograph once it's been seen</segment1>
		<segment2>Promise you won't let me fall asleep never to wake up. Til my breath is gone don't let the color of my eyes fade. Promise you will find a way through the night while the angels cry. You color your heart blood red love does not fade away</segment2>
		<segment3>Can't give back that photograph once it's been signed. And I can't stop thinking about your voice. Now it's keeping me up at night. I found myself on a black and white staring back at me. Now I know, can't get back that photograph. It just needs color</segment3>
		<segment4>Promise you won't let me fall asleep never to wake up. Til my breath is gone don't let the color of my eyes fade. Promise you will find a way through the night while the angels cry. You color your heart blood red love does not fade away</segment4>
		<segment5>Blood-drop on that black and white. Is the only thing that can colorize these non-colored eyes</segment5>
		<segment6>Promise you won't let me fall asleep never to wake up. Til my breath is gone don't let the color of my eyes fade. Promise you will find a way through the night while the angels cry. You color your heart blood red love does not fade    </segment6>
