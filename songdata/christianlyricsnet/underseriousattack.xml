		<segment1>you've taken this too far. now it has to stop. once again. the table has turned. and i'm behind. picking up the pieces from the night. my face is scared. sometimes I feel that I can't trust myself at all</segment1>
		<segment2>every time the sky. breaks open with sunshine. and streaming swords collide. it takes me back in time. I float away to another place. where heaven is waiting right outside</segment2>
		<segment3>this is war. can I take it anymore. i'm falling faster and bleeding more than i have bled before. certain death (this blade will carve a purpose). lingers on the other hand (and make you feel defeated). but i will fight you and victory will be mine in the end. circumstances mean nothing. when it's over we will be heroes. constantly pushing forward without any fear</segment3>
		<segment4>if i erased the line between. forgotten days and memories. i'd never change</segment4>
		<segment5>resolution made (in vain). to face (play out) the day. life is yours to save (save it). or take (take it) away    </segment5>
