		<segment1>I watch the walls fall down on Suburbia. Land of the free, home of the self-enslaved. On you. I watched them bleed, I watched them fall to their face. I watched them scream as they pray for a taste. Of you. (Watching the walls fall down)</segment1>
		<segment2>But I won't fall on the knife that killed the American dream.</segment2>
		<segment3>So let us grieve at the fall of Suburbia. The dreams we've made are shoved in the face. Of you. So get a taste of what was meant to be. Fall in the waste of what was meant to be. For you. (Watching the walls fall down)</segment3>

		<segment6>I watch the walls fall down on Suburbia. Land of the free, home of the self-enslaved. On you. I watched them bleed, I watched them fall to their face. I watched them scream as they pray for a taste. Of you. (Watching the walls fall down)</segment6>
