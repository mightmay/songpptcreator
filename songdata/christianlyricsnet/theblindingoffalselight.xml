		<segment1>I see now.. I see through the veil of expectation. I see now.. I see that conformity is betrayal.</segment1>
		<segment2>Betrayal of those who are forgotten, yet vision alone furthers our blame. Unless followed by transformation, it is pointless to be given sight. Without the hope of our reaction, we overlook the purpose of our eyes.</segment2>
		<segment3>Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny, released from the blinding of false light. (blinding of false light) Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny. In weakness we are freed..</segment3>
		<segment4>I see now.. I see that conformity is betrayal.</segment4>
		<segment5>With empty eyes I looked ahead (ahead), with clarity I now look back..</segment5>
		<segment6>Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny, released from the blinding of false light (blinding of false light). Now is our chance (our chance) to breathe without.. without tyranny. In weakness we are freed.. Yeah..</segment6>
		<segment7>I admit my failure. Opacity has dulled my senses. Conformity (conformity) controlled by lifeless vices. Oh.. Yeah.. Covetousness (covetousness) disguised as ambition. But now it ends.. But now it ends.. But now it ends.. But now it ends, not with defeat but determination.. We are freed.. Yeah..</segment7>
		<segment8>Now is our chance to breathe without tyranny, released from the blinding of false (false) light (light). Now is our chance.. Now is..our chance.. In weakness we are freed..    </segment8>
