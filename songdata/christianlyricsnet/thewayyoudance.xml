		<segment1>Softly like a touch of a dark angel. Her hand in yours. You're dressed to kill. Can she tell</segment1>
		<segment2>Swing your partner to the right. Swing your partner to the left. It scares me, the way you dance. She looks pretty. Hair glittering with confetti. How does it feel man. Hold steady. Is she ready. Does she like it dancing on the broken glass</segment2>
		<segment3>Watching you from across the room. One hand on the waist while the other, knuckles turning white. Are you holding on for dear life or does she not know how to let go</segment3>
		<segment4>Swing your partner to the left. It scares me, the way you dance. She looks pretty. Hair glittering with confetti. How does it feel man. Hold steady. Is she ready. Does she like it dancing on the broken glass</segment4>
		<segment5>I see you're wearing your shoes. Where are hers. And see I'm wearing my shoes</segment5>
		<segment6>I don't want to but in this square dance. Everybody has to dance. Everybody dance now</segment6>
		<segment7>Swing your partner to the left. It scares me, the way you dance. She looks pretty. Hair glittering with confetti. How does it feel man. Hold steady. Is she ready. Does she like it dancing on her broken dreams    </segment7>
