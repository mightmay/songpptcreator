		<segment1>Lord, let Your glory fall. As on that ancient day. Songs of enduring love. And then Your glory came. And as a sign to You. That we would love the same. Our hearts will sing that song. God, let Your glory come</segment1>
		<segment2>You are good, You are good. And Your love endures. You are good, You are good. And Your love endures. Today</segment2>
		<segment3>Voices in unison. Giving You thanks and praise. Joined by the instruments. And then Your glory came. Your presence like a cloud. Upon that ancient day. The priests were overwhelmed. Because Your glory came     </segment3>
