		<segment1>Here I am, it's all before you. I want to feel, but my heart is numb. There empty hands, are reaching for you. Cause no one else could be enough</segment1>
		<segment2>All I want is to be with you, all I need I've found within you. Love, you are my love. All my fear is lost beside you, all my life I lay before you. Love, you are my love</segment2>
		<segment3>You are my love. You are my love</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, you are my love. You're my love. My love, You are my life, Yeah!    </segment4>
