		<segment1>I'm waking up. The world is turning. The sun is shining again. I'm holding on. To things I shouldn't. It's time to let them go. I've been on a losing streak. Hit so hard I couldn't speak. But when I hear Your voice it fades away</segment1>
		<segment2>And I can hear You say. It's a brand new day. The pain goes away. I'm headed for the door. And I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home</segment2>
		<segment3>Your love, it burns. Away my darkness. You guide me when I'm blind. You are the light. That shines inside me. Showing me I'm. So much more. When I've been on a losing streak. Hit so hard I couldn't speak. But when I hear Your voice it fades away</segment3>
		<segment4>Take me into Your arms. My home lies within Your heart    </segment4>
