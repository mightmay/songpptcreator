		<segment1>How does it feel to find yourself playing for the wrong team with the stakes so high?. How does it feel to find yourself so blind to the sin your hiding deep inside?. Turn your back on the obvious facts and watch the city gnash and burn on you. Oblivious to your only way out and now the lifestyle's evidence too. Independence runs rampant while fire awaits for burning flesh overflowing like sets. Blind as the bats in the dark mindsets without hope of ever seeping through cracks. Like a fool. You're so proud of your arrogant mindset of lusts unspeakable, continue to drool. And now so content... Implement the tool. Your rainbow's a symbol. Of a smile on your face unforgettable. You look to the skies and smirk while your choice proves completely regrettable. Lust fills the sleepless nights. Thirty five and under the plight to sow invites. You'd better get to bead early.. Because the dawn's bringing light to melt the living penalty. And now you want to try to separate independence from your bonded state?. Worship your created self with unnatural debased states of mind for fates erased. With no excuse for ignorance 'cause His nature only proves His existence. Uncleanness assumes an image that's reflecting the faraway cry from creation. The signs of the times sign a contract (with fine print). providing your soul with destruction. And now you want to try to separate independence from your bonded state?    </segment1>
