		<segment1>I must have been confused or vain. to let this evil in my brain. Lord did I enjoy the change. that you made inside my heart?. Oh here they come. I'm not afraid. there's no temptation I can't evade. Stand up straight. look through the haze. I begin to walk through the maze. here they come. they're all up on me. but I'm dead to sin like. some kind of zombie. I hear you speak and I obey. some kind of zombie. I walked away from the grave. some kind of zombie. I will never be afraid. some kind of zombie. I gave my life away. I'm obliged and obey. I'm enslaved to what you say.    </segment1>
