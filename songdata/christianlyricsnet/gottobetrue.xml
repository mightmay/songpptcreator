		<segment1>Well normally at this point you'd hear me sing. And I'd be doing that acoustic guitar thing. So by now you're probably wondering what's going on. 'Cause this is really starting to sound like one of those rap songs. Well let me tell you what the boy's up to. You see I like rap music and the beat box groove. And sometimes I gotta admit I close all the doors. And wave my arms around and pace the floor. But then I crack up laughing and I have to stop. And just face the facts the boy don't hip hop. I grew up in a state where the grass is blue. So if it's gonna be believable it's gotta be true</segment1>
		<segment2>It's got to be true I've gotta be living what I say I believe. It's got to be true even when nobody but Jesus is watching me. It's got to be true every single minute of every day. If anybody's ever gonna look at me and say hey it's got to be true</segment2>
		<segment3>Case in point I've got a next door neighbor. And I can tell that he's been watching my behavior. 'Cause He's heard that I'm a Christian guy. And He want's to find out if it's the truth or a lie. He's got a mile long list of reasons not to believe. Like doubt dissolution and hypocrisy. It's gonna take some living proof to break through those walls. Yea it's gotta be true if he'll believe it at all</segment3>
		<segment4>It's got to be true I've gotta be living what I say I believe. It's got to be true even when nobody but Jesus is watching me. It's got to be true every single minute of every day. If anybody's ever gonna look at me and say hey it's got to be true. Whoa it's got to be true gotta let the light of Jesus' love come shining thru </segment4>
