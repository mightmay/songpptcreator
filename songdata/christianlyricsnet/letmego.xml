		<segment1>See I can still remember when. You said you were my only friend. Yeah Mr. Fear you captured me. I was blinded and couldn't see. That real love was bound to come. And confront what I was running from. (He)opened up my eyes and let me know. That I don't need you no mo'</segment1>
		<segment2>. Chorus. Let me go, oh let me go. Yeah let me go. Oh let me go, go</segment2>

		<segment4>. Chorus. Let me go, oh let me go. Yeah let me go. Oh let me go, go    </segment4>
