		<segment1>If only I could see me as you see me. And understand the way that I am loved. Would it give a whole new meaning to my purpose. Change the way I see the world</segment1>
		<segment2>Would I sparkle like a star in the night sky. Would I give a little more instead of take. If I understood I'm precious like the diamond. I'm a worth noone could estimate. I'm a worth noone could estimate</segment2>
		<segment3>You say lovely. I say broken. I say guilty. You say forgiven. I feel lonely. Say you're with me. We both know it would change everything. If only I believed the truth about me</segment3>
		<segment4>I wish I could hold on to the moments. When my life is spinnin but I'm peaceful still. Like a wind you whispered in the silence. And tell me things this world never will. You tell me things this world never will</segment4>
		<segment5>You say lovely. I say broken. I say guilty. You say forgiven. I feel lonely. Say you're with me. We both know it would change everything. If only I believed the truth about me</segment5>
		<segment6>I would sleep better at night. Wake up with hope for another day. I would love even if it cost me. Take a chance and know I'm going be ok. I would dare to give my life away..</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, I feel lonely. Say you're with me. We both know it would change everything. If only I believed the truth about me. If only I believed the truth about me    </segment7>
