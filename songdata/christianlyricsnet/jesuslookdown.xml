		<segment1>Jesus look down on my open heart. Whatever I need Lord let it start. Melt me and mold me. Make me in your likeness. Cleanse me and fill me up. Make me overflow. Your love let my life show</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus reach down and take in your hand. My life, my all; Lord fulfill your plan. As I?m singing your praise. Seeking your face. Jesus just have your own way    </segment2>
