		<segment1>God is a present. Help in time of trouble. He will lift this up. And he will always make a way</segment1>
		<segment2>Tell me what you see when I pass by. Shut up a . line in the sky. Am I getting you to . or am I getting you by. All I can take is one step at the time</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Look at me. Im trying. Every day .. Make mistakes. Keep that .. Try again .. See me</segment3>
		<segment4>Im walking (repeats)</segment4>
		<segment5>Some people see walking takes too long</segment5>
		<segment6>But I say with walking you cant go wrong. Why should you rush away trough life?. You wont get there if youre running all the time</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus. Why does my life say . up all on me. Cant anyone see. Does it show I rock with the greatest?. I cant get back the time I spent. Use the rest of it to show the other world how I made it</segment7>
		<segment8>Im walking (repeats)    </segment8>
