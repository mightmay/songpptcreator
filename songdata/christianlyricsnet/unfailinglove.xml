		<segment1>We wait in hope for You. Our shelter and our truth. You are always faithful to Your word. Consume our hearts and minds. Be the author of this life. Your Kingdom come, Your will be done</segment1>
		<segment2>In these times of doubt and sorrow. People need a hope to cling to. Your love is an anchor in the storms of life. Forever faithful</segment2>
		<segment3>Unfailing love. You never let us down. Your promise is alive</segment3>
		<segment4>When coloured dreams fade to grey (unfailing love). When the night crowds out the day (unfailing love). When there's no words left to say. God's love remains    </segment4>
