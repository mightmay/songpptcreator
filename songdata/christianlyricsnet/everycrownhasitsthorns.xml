		<segment1>We're both like Simon we still live in a state of denial. Although we'd both like to go to heaven, We feel surprised about the trial. But the suff'ring Christ did accomplished somethin' and the worst all turned out right. Go and find out in Hebrews chapter 5 verses 7 through 9. </segment1>
		<segment2>You see every crown has it's thorn, Just like every life has it's cross, Just like every choirboy sings some sad,sad songs, Every crown has it's thorns,it does. </segment2>
		<segment3>A Christian needs to take his cross,take it up and hit the road. Yeah, 'cause Jesus said lots of times that we should do it and He should know. But I wonder as he walked,If he ever felt like quittin'. Yet I know we wouldn't be here right now,if Christ took a different road than Calvary. </segment3>
		<segment4>You see every crown has it's thorn, Just like every life has it's cross, Just like every choirboy sings some sad,sad songs, Every crown has it's thorns,it does. </segment4>
		<segment5>Though I'm on trial now Christ can still feel all my pain. Like the nails that cut through and bruised him,'cause the scars,Christ's scars remain. </segment5>
		<segment6>I know if He could have saved his life that night if Christ chose to run away. Instead of takin off,He chose to take the narrow way. And now I'm in heaven bound and born anew,and man I never had that much to lose. I'm here to bear my cross in life and to see Him on the other side,because. </segment6>
		<segment7>You see every crown has it's thorn, Just like every life has it's cross, Just like every choirboy sings some sad,sad songs, Every crown has it's thorns,it does. </segment7>
