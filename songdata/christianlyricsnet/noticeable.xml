		<segment1>This world has changed and. I don't feel safe here. All of this violence has. left me so shaken. Ignorance is no way to live. and if you could open your. eyes and just give a little, we would feel so much safer.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: We've already demolished what we had. There's no more beauty left to give. So listen to me man. We are like brothers. We both have the same hearts and. they both have been broken. We both have lived these sheltered lives. and we both have heard all the flippin' lies. At lease we know now.</segment2>
		<segment3>Our dreams should be fulfilled and not shattered. As long as we're here it doesn't matter. We'll come together and be as one. And when we've left our mark it will all be done.    </segment3>
