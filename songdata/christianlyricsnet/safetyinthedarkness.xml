		<segment1>There's nothing I can say to build these bridges back. Against the tides that washed them away. The life has left this room. Like a thousand fires gone black against the sky and scarlet moon. The smoke is in the air, choking out the sun. It's rising in the air, I can't see. And I will find you there, somewhere in the dark. Buried in a place between dead and broken hearts. There's safety in the darkness, there's safty in the dark. I have left these shores to face the tempest night. That stirs the stars against the waters with its storms. The sirens sing their song. It's like a thousand hands that pull me down and break the course I travel on. The ocean fills my lungs, drowning out the sun. It's rising in my lungs, I can't breathe. I close my eyes to see the light that's leading me    </segment1>
