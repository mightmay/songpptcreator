		<segment1>Cause me to thirst for You, Lord. Cause	me	to	hunger	for your	word. Cause me to require You as my vital need. Until	I	am	in	love	with You. Until	I	am	in	love	with You. Help me to push through all the clamor. Until I find the sound of Your voice. Strengthen me to war against my enemies. Until	I	am	in	love	with You. Until	I	am	in	love	with You. [Chorus]. I need You, Lord..I want You, Lord Consume my heart.. Until	I	am	in	love	with You. Until	I	am	in	love	with You. Jesus, Ive tasted of Your mercy. Im taken by the power of Your love. Even now I offer up my heart, my life. Until	I	am	in	love	with You. Until	I	am	in	love	with You    </segment1>
