		<segment1>&quot;Set The World On Fire&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna set the world on fire. Until it's burning bright for You. It's everything that I desire. Can I be the one You use?</segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS]. I, I am small but. You, You are big enough. I, I am weak but. You, You are strong enough to. Take my dreams. Come and give them wings. Lord with You. Nothing I can not do. Nothing I cannot do</segment3>
		<segment4>I wanna feed the hungry children. And reach across the farthest land. And tell the broken there is healing. And mercy in the Father's hands</segment4>
		<segment5>[CHORUS]</segment5>
		<segment6>Take my dreams. Come and give them wings. Lord with You. Nothing I cannot do. Nothing I cannot do</segment6>
		<segment7>My hands my feet. My everything. My life, my love. Lord, use me</segment7>
		<segment8>I wanna set the world on fire. I wanna set the world on fire, yeah</segment8>
		<segment9>Take my dreams. Come and give them wings. Lord with You. Nothing I cannot do. Take my dreams. Come and give them wings. Lord with You. There's nothing I can't do. Nothing I can't do</segment9>
		<segment10>I'm gonna set the world on fire. Set the world on fire</segment10>
