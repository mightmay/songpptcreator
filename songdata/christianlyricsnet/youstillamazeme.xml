		<segment1>there's nothing new under the sun. left for me to do. the last great thrills I've felt are fleeting. once I was excited. for the things the world could give. but no more. I'm only thrilled by you, </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. And you.. ..you still amaze me. you still amaze me. bigger that the sky. brighter than the sun. you're the one </segment2>
		<segment3>You filled me with the things I need. and gave me something more. and I've ran with the freedom. that you gave me. you're the reason for the stars that decorate my night. so I sing, yeah I sing </segment3>
		<segment4>REPEAT CHORUS </segment4>
		<segment5>You're the maker. and I'm free to be loved. I'm alive from your gentle touch. I'm touched from the sky. let me cry, you're amazing </segment5>
		<segment6>REPEAT CHORUS     </segment6>
