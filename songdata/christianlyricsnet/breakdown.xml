		<segment1>oh, what a lousy excuse for a car. one mile to go, but i can't push it that far. i think i've had enough. i think i'm giving up</segment1>
		<segment2>saved all my money to buy a new guitar. then i got ripped off by the guy who fixed my car. i think i've had enough. i think i'm giving up</segment2>
		<segment3>once again life's thrown me a curve, and it blew up right in my face. once again life's rattled my nerves. don't you see what i'm stuck in the place?</segment3>
		<segment4>all because, you're giving me a ..breakdown. stuck on the side of the road. emotional over-load. he'll seek and destroy everything that i enjoy. but, i won't be the one he takes down. no, i won't breakdown    </segment4>
