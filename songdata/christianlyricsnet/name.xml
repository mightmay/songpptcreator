		<segment1>Seven days old in the icu tonight. Little baby boy, they don't want to have to say goodbye. Your mother's on the phone. Your father's in the hall. Prayin' &quot;God,save this life&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>He sees you. He's near you. He knows your name. He knows your pain. He sees you and He loves you. He knows your name. He knows your name</segment2>
		<segment3>Four doors down there's a man who just won't wake up. He crashed so hard. And the doctor's want to pull the plug. Your wife is by your side sayin' &quot;Not tonight&quot;. Prayin' God will just show up.</segment3>
		<segment4>He sees you. He's near you. He knows your name. He knows your pain. He sees you and He loves you. He knows your name. He knows your name</segment4>
		<segment5>Maybe you're alone. In a corner of an empty house. Or maybe you're the one. No one notices in the crowd</segment5>
		<segment6>He sees you. He's near you. He knows your name. He knows your pain. He sees you and He loves you. He knows your name. He knows your name</segment6>
		<segment7>He knows your name. He knows your name    </segment7>
