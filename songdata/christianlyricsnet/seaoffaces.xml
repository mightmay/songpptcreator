		<segment1>I see the city lights all around me. Everyone's obscure. Ten million people each with their problems. Why should anyone care</segment1>
		<segment2>And in Your eyes I can see. I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world. Lost in a Sea of Faces. Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine. Because you traded Your life for mine</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes my life it feels so trivial. Immersed in the greatness of space. Yet somehow you still find the time for me. It's then You show me Your love</segment3>
		<segment4>And In Your eyes I can see. And in Your arms I will be. I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world. Lost in a Sea of Faces. Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine. Because you traded Your life for mine</segment4>
		<segment5>If only my one heart. Was all you'd gain from all it cost. Well I know you would have still been a man. With a reason. To willingly offer your life</segment5>
		<segment6>I am not just a man, vastly lost in this world. Lost in a Sea of Faces. Your body's the bread, Your blood is the wine. Because you traded Your life for mine</segment6>
		<segment7>Just one in a million faces    </segment7>
