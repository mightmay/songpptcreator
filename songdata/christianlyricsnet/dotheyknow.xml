		<segment1>Im one of the chosen few. God chose to carry to. A hopeless and dying world. Good News. Im a disciple of. A caring Fathers love. A light to the world. To show them the way</segment1>
		<segment2>Do they know. Can they see. Jesus lives in me. Do they know. Can they see. Jesus lives in me</segment2>
		<segment3>A vacant house comes alive. When somebody moves inside. A light in the window means somebodys home. I say Jesus lives in me. But can everybody see. The light of His love that shines in my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>Do they know. Can they see. Jesus lives in me. Do they know. Can they see. Jesus lives in me</segment4>
		<segment5>A cloud of witnesses surrounds us. Who long to share what weve received. Tell me where will they see Jesus. If not in you and me</segment5>
		<segment6>So we must let them know. Let them see Jesus lives in you and me. Let them know let them see. He is all they need. Jesus is all we need.     </segment6>
