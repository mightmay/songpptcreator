		<segment1>I'm trying hard to understand you. And your over-rated state of mind. Sometimes you try to move me to you. And make believe that it's all fine </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You say you love me, yes you do. But I know who I'm talking to. You left me so lonely and empty. And I don't need your alibis. Cause I can see through all your lies. You say you love me and I'll need you. But I don't need to live my life that way, no way </segment2>
		<segment3>Every storm deserves an ending. And a break to peaceful skies. And every night I pray for my own mending </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Parading around like you're a superstar. Is that who you think you are. The higher you go, yeah, the harder you fall </segment5>
		<segment6>You say you love me, yes you do. But I know who I'm talking to. You left me so lonely and empty. And I don't need your alibis. Cause I can see through your disguise. You say you love me and I'll need you. But I don't need to live my life that way, no way    </segment6>
