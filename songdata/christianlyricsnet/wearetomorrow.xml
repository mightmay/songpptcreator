		<segment2>. Freeze the frame, memorize it. Take the mistakes, and don't go back. To where we've always been. The time has come that we begin, to shine. To shine. It's our time. It's now or never. We want today. We want yesterday. We are tomorrow. Here we come, it's our season. I swear that it's true. But it takes more than what we are. Faith in more than what we are to shine, to shine. It's our time. It's now or never. We want today. We want yesterday. We are tomorrow. Can we ever, it's now or never, it's our time. Will we ever, it's now or never.     </segment2>
