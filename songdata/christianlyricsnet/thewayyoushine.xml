		<segment1>The new moon is climbing. Over the horizon. Chasing the day away</segment1>
		<segment2>Seems like I've been waiting. All my life just to take in. One glimpse, one view. With these eyes, and I knew</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: The way that you shine. You took the light from all the stars. And put it in this heart of mine. What would you say if I told you. I could never live without you like. The way you shine</segment3>
		<segment4>You came and shook me. When I thought I would be. On my own, alone</segment4>
		<segment5>And now all this sadness. We'll leave it behind us. It's all so clear. We can start right here</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Shine, shine, the way you shine. Shine, shine</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Shine, shine, the way you shine. Shine, shine, the way you shine. Shine, shine, the way you shine. Shine, shine</segment9>
		<segment10>The way you shine. The way you shine. Shine    </segment10>
