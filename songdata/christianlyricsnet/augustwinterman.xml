		<segment2>Perfect &quot; As if my wings were like yours. But I'm falling down.</segment2>
		<segment3>And if you could hold your tongue long enough.. You'd see that all I am is love, but I don't like me. I despise me.</segment3>
		<segment4>Perfect &quot; As if my wings were like yours. But I'm falling down. Perfect &quot; As if my wings were like yours. But I'm falling down.</segment4>
