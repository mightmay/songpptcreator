		<segment1>First came a strong wind, ripping off rooftops like bottlecaps. and bending lampposts down to the ground. then came a thunder shattering my windows. but you were not that strong wind or that might sound. that left the barn in shambles, the rabbit hutch in ruins. the split-rail fence splintered and the curtains torn, all the cows out from the pastures trampling on the pumpkins. and the horses from their stables ambling in the corn </segment1>
		<segment2>Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam </segment2>
		<segment3>I've flown unnoticed just behind you like an insect. and I've watched you like a falcon from a distance as you passed. then swooped down to be nearer to the traces of your footsteps. to pick the fallen grain from the dirt beneath the crooked grass. and I'm gonna take that grain and I'm gonna crush it all together. into the flour of a bread as small and simple and sincere. as when the dryness and the rain finally drink from one another. the gentle cup of mutual surrender tears </segment3>
		<segment4>A fish swims through the sea, while the sea is in a certain sense. contained within the fish!. Ah, what am I to think. of what the writing of a thousand lifetimes. could not explain. if all the forest trees were pens. and all the oceans ink? </segment4>
		<segment5>nastagh-firuka ya Hokan. ya Dhal-Jalah wal-Ikram. Isa ruhu-lah 'alaihis-salat was-salam. ya Halim, ya Qahhar. ya Muntaqim, ya Ghaffar!. la Ilaha ilallahu, Allahu Akbar!.     </segment5>
