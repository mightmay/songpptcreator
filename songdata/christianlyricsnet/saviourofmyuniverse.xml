		<segment1>I don't propose that we preserve. All the world inside a fragile ball of glass. 'Cause I'm the first to throw the curve. Bringin' all that perfect ball down in a crash. Oh, it's that feelin' comin' back again. Turnin' earth around and pounding sirens in my head. Well there's only one cure that I know for sure. And it goes on and on. It goes on and on. Chorus: And when it all is said and done. Until the end. Yes, You're the only one. And when the world is in reverse. You're the Saviour of my universe. I don't suppose I'm prone to trouble. Though I always do the very best I can. My universe a leaky bubble. Pinned by a friend. And then only did it expand. Oh, it's that feelin' comin' back again. Turnin' earth around. And pounding sirens in my head. Well there's only one cure. That I know for sure. And it goes on and on. It goes on and on. Repeat chorus    </segment1>
