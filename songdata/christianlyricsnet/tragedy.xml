		<segment1>I look around and see all of these different places. And I can't help but think of all these different faces. Have made the same mistake and got up and walked away. You'll never hear me say, It's time to walk away</segment1>
		<segment2>Why am I so afraid when I've got nothing to fear?. How did it dissipate?  How did it all disappear?. When I anticipate this time, I won't shed a tear. I let it resonate for everybody to hear</segment2>
		<segment3>Somebody tell me how to save me from myself. Cause my worst enemy is staring back at me. Somebody tell me how to save me from myself. Cause everytime that I try, it's such a tragedy</segment3>
		<segment4>If I'm the opposition, why can't I just back down?. So full of ammunition that tries to shoot me down. In all this repetition that's going round and round. Submit to my submission before I get shot down</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause all I see is somebody else watching me. It's the enemy, and I know I can see the enemy.     </segment5>
