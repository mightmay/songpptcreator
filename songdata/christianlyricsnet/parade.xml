		<segment1>This is my melody. this is my sympathy for your coming out. this is your coming out parade</segment1>
		<segment2>You've been here for several years. and your life's been quite alright till now. He says &quot;you've done something wrong&quot;. you've scored, but he says you've done something wrong. Reaching out for him to hold you, or just to call you, holding off for something. just to sing along.</segment2>
		<segment3>This is my melody. this is my sympathy for your coming out. this is your coming out parade. this is my melody for your coming out</segment3>
		<segment4>Kindness is dead in this town. and drama has been crowned. the acceptable medium of living. Kindness is dead in this town. and drama holds the crown. All alone here, dying slowing here. Screaming loud dear, that you. you need more from me.</segment4>
		<segment5>You know, you know. it's gleaming out your eyes. and you know, you know. it's sneaking through your precious lips    </segment5>
