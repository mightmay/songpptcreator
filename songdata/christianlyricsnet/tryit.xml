		<segment1>I don't even want to guess. How much it hurts to have. Nothing in the way of this. I will never know you sad. You didn't even see us here. You might as well disappear. It didn't matter all along. It didn't matter right or wrong</segment1>
		<segment2>Decide. I will be fine. And all along the back of my mind, I am. Way too fast. This won't, won't last. 'Cause I'm way too fast. You cant, can't see my mind and I'm. Way too young, what I believe is mine alone. And I'm way too fast. Can't take my reason why tonight</segment2>
		<segment3>Even when I'm all alone. I take in the breath and hold. Average is 5 a day. I have plenty more to take. And what am I to say to you?. What do I fall into?. Fall into all the lies. Can you make me realize?. (Can you make me realize?)</segment3>
		<segment4>Decide. I will be fine. (I take in the breath and hold). And all along the back of my mind, I am. Way too fast. This won't, won't last. 'Cause I'm way too fast. You can't, can't see my mind and I'm. Way too young, what I believe is mine alone. And I'm way too fast. Can't take my reason why tonight</segment4>
		<segment5>(Can't take my reason why tonight). Way too fast. This won't, won't last. 'Cause I'm way too fast. You can't, can't see my mind and I'm. Way too young, what I believe is mine alone. And I'm way too fast. Can't take my reason why tonight    </segment5>
