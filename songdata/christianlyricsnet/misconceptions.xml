		<segment1>Day after day after day. You live in your misconceptions. Cuz our actions. Don't speak as loud as our words. It hurts, my friend. Can I help you understand?. Can I please help you understand what I see? </segment1>
		<segment2>It's not bred out of fear. It's sprung out of love. It's what we've been in search of </segment2>
		<segment3>Now spring clear of all the lies. And sever all the ties. With tangled webs of futile thinking. Now spring clear of all half-truths. Cuz the burden of proof. Doesn't rest on an institution </segment3>
		<segment4>Yeah I can see all the hurt. And the misery resulting from the fact. That Christians are the biggest sinners of them all. But please don't fall. Don't let all those who come in Christ's name fool you. Don't you dare, don't you dare </segment4>
		<segment5>It's not bred out of pride. A trophy on the shelf. I can't save you. I can't even save myself </segment5>
		<segment6>If we've been on our knees. But our eyes have been closed. To all the pain and suffering. I cry out, &quot;God forgive us!&quot;.     </segment6>
