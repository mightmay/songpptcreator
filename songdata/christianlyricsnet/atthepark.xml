		<segment1>It rips me up &quot; spits me out &quot; I'm messed up &quot; in this rut -. Caught up in this system &quot; put down as another victim -. my fingernails are fading away &quot; and my hair is looking lazy -. but that's okay, yeah, but I think I may go crazy - </segment1>
		<segment2>this time I have don't feel my own -. this life I live feels like a joke. -. but still I try to take control -. still on my own, all alone - </segment2>
		<segment3>here I go again &quot; go &quot; I lie awake -. In my car &quot; at the park &quot; I &quot;I run away -. It's half past three and I can't sleep -. looking up at the stars &quot; looking up in the dark - </segment3>
		<segment4>this time I have don't feel my own -. this life I live feels like a joke -. but still I try to take control -. still on my own, all alone    </segment4>
