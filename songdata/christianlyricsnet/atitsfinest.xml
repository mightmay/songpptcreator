		<segment1>What you said, and what you meant, Didnt ever seem to meet, So negative in how you see, But who could change the way you think. Pessimistically, you have trained your mind to think. Life is down always down because you chained yourself to misery. So look up, joy in, begin to deepen. To think things humbly, to lock up pride and throw away key. To think things humbly, to lock up pride and throw away key.</segment1>
		<segment2>Others care for you, do you care for them as well?. I have learned that depression comes when our eyes are on ourselves. Pessimistically you have trained your mind to think. Life is down, always down because you chained yourself to misery.</segment2>
		<segment3>So look up, joy in, Begin to deepen. To think things humbly, to lock up pride and throw away key. To think things humbly, to lock up pride and throw away key. Things always work out you know its fine, but somehow they get complex in our minds. I promise if wed all serve humbly life would be all right, I know youll see. To think things humbly, to lock up pride and throw away key. To think things humbly, to lock up pride and throw away key.    </segment3>
