		<segment1>I started to ache when I started to think of you. Wondering how long it would take beore I step into something new. There's only so much I can fake. There's only so much that I can prove. Well, do it in a minute, I could go play the fool for you.</segment1>
		<segment2>Lights, camera, action. I think I'm going for it this time. There's something you should listen to. Could I take you for a car ride?. This is the soundtrack for our movie. Would you tell me when we get to the best part?. I'll play it for you. Oh no, I think I've lost this one. Can we try again?</segment2>
		<segment3>Well I'm a wreck. I really can't explain it but I, I hear the music when I look at you. Orchestrating the song to accommodate the moment. Well, I'm so in love with you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Are you looking for an answer?. Because I could really use a friend tonight. We can make this last forever. We don't have to fear the sunlight.</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll take a chance and steal away this movie moment.</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm in deep whenever I'm with you. I'm directing the scene that has you and me forever. We'll I'm so in love with.. </segment6>
