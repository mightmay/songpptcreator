		<segment1>verse 1. what does the cross of Jesus mean?. it's more than songs we sing. much more than the emblem on your chain. but it means i am free. from the chains of slavery. and the blood he shed won't let my sins remain</segment1>
		<segment2>verse 2. upon the cross my savior died. the lamb was crucified. showed us love that this world has never known. oh what love divine. truer love you'll never find. o that we might live. love came and died alone</segment2>
		<segment3>hook. for the cross will always represent the love God has for me. when the Lord of glory heaven-sent gave all on calvary. (he did it) just for me, just for me. Jesus came and did it just for me</segment3>
		<segment4>(choir comes in with the hook)</segment4>
		<segment5>chorus. just for me, just for me. Jesus came and did it just for me. just for me, just for me. Jesus came and did it just for me    </segment5>
