		<segment1>Face and embrace. When decisions lead up to consequence. I force down the drain. any remnants left I let slip away.</segment1>
		<segment2>Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Because of all.</segment2>
		<segment3>Give it some time. Mulling it over. Pulling down the shades til the nerves recover. You wanna know whats really bothering me?. Im not passive aggressive, but I had to leave.</segment3>
		<segment4>Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Because of all the things I should have said. Because of all.</segment4>
		<segment5>Give it some time. Mulling it over. Pulling down shades. til I can settle the score. Closer, a little more. Closer, a little more..</segment5>
		<segment6>Face and embrace. When decisions lead up to consequence. I force down the drain. any remnants left I let slip away.</segment6>
		<segment7>Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Give it time, just a little closer. Because of all the things I couldnt say to you. Build it up just a little more. Because of all the things I should have said to you. Give it time, just a little closer. Because of all the things I should have said to you. Because of all. Because of all the things I couldnt say to you.     </segment7>
