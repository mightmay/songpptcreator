		<segment1>Lord, make us instruments of Your peace. Where there is hatred, let Your love increase. Lord, make us instruments of Your peace. Walls of pride and prejudice will cease. When we are your instruments of peace</segment1>
		<segment2>Where there is hatred, we will sow His Love. Where there is injury, we will never judge. Where there is striving, we will speak His peace. To the people crying for release. We will be Your instruments of peace</segment2>
		<segment3>Where there is blindness, we will pray for sight. Where there is darkness, we will shine His light. Where there is sadness, we will bear their grief. To the millions crying for release. We will be Your instruments of peace    </segment3>
