		<segment1>The phone starts ringing again I think it's my girlfriend. This time I know this it's finally over. She keeps bringing me down, will this all turn around. Right now I feel like I'm slowly dying</segment1>
		<segment2>You know I've heard it all before. Now my eyes they run like faucets. Until my tears are dry</segment2>
		<segment3>She said we were in love. I take a sip of my water. I guess we'll carry on at last. She still thinks it's my fault. And I'm nobody at all. She must have thought it was someone else before</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm not so special now, I always knew it somehow. I guess she never had guts to tell me. Is it my spiked blond hair, that fact my chest is bare. Or that my wardrobe is all in black, it's all in black. It's all in black, you want me back?. Well I won't be back</segment4>
		<segment5>Because you're always keeping score. But now the scorecard's in my pocket. And now the match is won</segment5>
		<segment6>She said we were in love. I take a sip of my water. I guess we'll carry on at last. She still thinks it's my fault. And I'm nobody at all. She must have thought I was someone else before.     </segment6>
