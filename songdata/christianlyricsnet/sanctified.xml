		<segment1>Let there be no condemnation. For all who are fully known in Christ. Unspeakable grace for all the nations. By way of holy sacrifice</segment1>
		<segment2>We worship with the sound. Of broken shackles. Falling to the ground</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Sanctified. I have been set free. Grace divine. Has swept me off my feet</segment3>
		<segment4>No greater love has ever been known. Than He who came to find the lost. No greater sacrifice has been shown. Than He who laid upon the cross</segment4>
		<segment5>Let all creation sing. For He has come. And HeÂ’s changed everything</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge. And I know that I will never be the same</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus    </segment8>
