		<segment1>Drum machine joy - Drum machine joy. Soon the Goodness King will hear your heart. From within the castle to his warm hearth. Granting Hope and Wisdom to your soul. The evil spell of sadness has been broken </segment1>
		<segment2>In your heart, there's a world of sadness. I love you with all heart. In your heart with my words I promise. To love you with all heart, And Drum Machine Joy. Soon the Goodness King will hear your heart. From the Northern Kingdom comes a faint sound. Growing stronger here before the heart. The Chorus of the King has come to heal your heart. In your heart, there's a world of sadness. I love you with all heart. In your heart with my words I promise. To love you with all heart, And Drum Machine Joy. (Music Interlude).     </segment2>
