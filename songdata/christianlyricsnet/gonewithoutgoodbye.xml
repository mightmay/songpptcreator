		<segment1>Have you seen my son?. Not too tall, 5'8&quot;. She held up a coloured copy, photograph. From his wedding day. And this is his pregnant wife. Carrying his last dream. He walked down 46 floors before he felt the rush. The rush of gasoline</segment1>
		<segment2>I can feel the pain. Looking in their eyes. But I don't know gone without good-bye. If I could reach the sky. I'd bring him right back to your arms. Though I haven't seen your son, he's forever in my life</segment2>
		<segment3>Have you seen my little girl?. She's got curly black hair. She took this Raggedy-Ann doll, everywhere. Last I saw her over there. Then I heard a plight of screams. And a speeding van. I watched these tears pour down. A father's last attemp of being a rational man</segment3>
		<segment4>Though I can feel the pain. Look into his eyes. But I don't know gone without good-bye. If I could reach the sky I'd bring her right back to your arms. Though I haven't seen your girl, she's forever in my life</segment4>
		<segment5>Mm mm, Ohh</segment5>
		<segment6>And have you seen my faith?. It can run, it can hide. Jesus mend this breaking heart of mine. That keeps on loving life</segment6>
		<segment7>Though I can feel the pain. Look into my eyes. But I don't know gone without good-bye. If I could reach the sky. I'd try to turn the world around. So that we could see the face of forever. Stay alive     </segment7>
