		<segment1>VS 1: Reflecting back on when I met you. I was so lost. In this crazy world. Like a father to his child. Lord you saved me. Gave me wings of love. To soar so free</segment1>
		<segment2>You are the air I breathe. You are my everything. You are my only hope. The wind beneath my wings</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: And I never knew what love was. Until I met you. I never felt peace before. Until you touched me. I didn't know how to breathe. Until you showed me. You are my everything, everything, everything, yeah</segment3>
		<segment4>VS 2: Beside you Lord. There is no other. Creator of the universe. And you loved me so. You gave your only son. The only way, the only truth, the one</segment4>
		<segment5>You are the air I breathe. You are my everything. You are my only hope. The reason why I sing</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus 3x </segment6>
		<segment7>.     </segment7>
