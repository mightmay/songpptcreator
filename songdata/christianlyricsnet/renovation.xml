		<segment1>Something keeps you this night. Deep within the inside. Burning from the first light, you know. Won't escape this moment. Your renovation's coming. Now here the change will happen, you know. Come on now. This is what you're dreaming of </segment1>
		<segment2>And you feel it coming, you feel it coming. Your heart starts beating, your heart starts beating. You feel it coming, you feel it coming. Your soul stirs, your soul stirs </segment2>
		<segment3>This world takes advantage of us. It steals instead of loves us. Until it makes us nauseous, you know. But you won't play like they do. The twisted waves won't fake you. And emptiness won't break you, you know. Come on now. This is what you're dreaming of </segment3>
		<segment4>You won't be needing all your drugs tonight. The rage that's moving you will make your soul to rise     </segment4>
