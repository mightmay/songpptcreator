		<segment1>All alone in a crowded room. No place for me to fit into. Empty face with a painted smile. I don't know why</segment1>
		<segment2>But when you find me in my busy streets of emptiness. Remind me Im not ever on my own</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't know how you love me like you do. Its so good to belong with you. In all the places Im a stranger to. Its so good to belong with you </segment3>
		<segment4>Still the same even if I try. Im in the middle but Im still outside. Can someone tell me where I went wrong. I don't understand at all</segment4>
		<segment5>Is it really worth it in the end. To try time and time again. Looking for what has always been right there.     </segment5>
