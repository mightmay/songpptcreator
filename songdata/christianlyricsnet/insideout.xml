		<segment1>I used to wanna live inside a fairytale. I wanted to be perfect and complete. But every time I tried to figure out my life. I was always disappointed with the ending</segment1>
		<segment2>And everything's different now. I am not the same anymore</segment2>
		<segment3>Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me. Re-arranging me from the inside out. Only you can take away. All my superficial ways. You have shown me what beauty's about. From the inside out</segment3>
		<segment4>Every day I find another reason why. I'm grateful for the miracle you sent. And even when it's hard I gotta thank you Lord. For giving me the blessing of a breath</segment4>
		<segment5>The one thing I know that is true. It's not about me anymore. It's all about You</segment5>
		<segment6>Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me. Re-arranging me from the inside out. Only you can take away. All my superficial ways. You have shown me what beauty's about. From the inside out</segment6>
		<segment7>Fairytales come and go. But everybody knows. There's more to be told</segment7>
		<segment8>Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me. Re-arranging me from the inside out. Only you can take away. All my superficial ways</segment8>
		<segment9>Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me. Re-arranging me from the inside out. Only you can take away. All my superficial ways. You have shown me what beauty's about. From the inside out</segment9>
		<segment10>From the inside out. From the inside out    </segment10>
