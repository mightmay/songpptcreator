		<segment1>Before the day. Before the light. Before the world revolved around the sun. God on high. Stepped down into time. And wrote the story of His love for everyone</segment1>
		<segment2>He has filled our hearts with wonder. So that we always remember</segment2>
		<segment3>You and I were made to worship. You and I are called to love. You and I are forgiven and free. You and I embrace surrender. You and I choose to believe. You and I will see who we were meant to be</segment3>
		<segment4>All we are. And all we have. Is all a gift from God that we receive. Brought to life. We open up our eyes. To see the majesty and glory of the King</segment4>
		<segment5>He has filled our hearts with wonder. So that we always remember</segment5>
		<segment6>You and I were made to worship. You and I are called to love. You and I are forgiven and free. You and I embrace surrender. You and I choose to believe. You and I will see who we were meant to be</segment6>
		<segment7>And even the rocks cry out. And even the Heavens shout. At the sound of His holy name. So let every voice sing out. And let every knee bow down. He is worthy of all our praise</segment7>
		<segment8>You and I were made to worship. You and I are called to love. You and I are forgiven and free, yeah. You and I embrace surrender. You and I choose to believe. You and I will see, you and I will see</segment8>
		<segment9>You and I were made to worship. You and I are called to love. You and I are forgiven and free, yeah. You and I embrace surrender. You and I choose to believe. You and I will see who we were meant to be    </segment9>
