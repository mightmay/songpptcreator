		<segment1>In this little room I put my pen to the paper. To write what's in my heart down on a page. with every line, a silent prayer is being lifted. That this song will somehow find its way. From this little room to your heart</segment1>
		<segment2>In this little room with just a microphone to hear me. I sing what's in my heart while the music plays. And with every line, a silent prayer is being lifted. That the song will somehow find its way. From this little room to your heart</segment2>
		<segment3>I close my eyes, imagining your faces. I see the smiles, the tears, the joys, the pain. We may be strangers but I can give this song to you. Because the One who gave me this song knows your name. He knows your name, He knows your name</segment3>
		<segment4>In this little room tonight I'll be praying. As Jesus comes and meets you where you are. We'll hear His voice together if we'll listen. And we'll find its really not that far. From this little room, from this little room. From this little room to your heart     </segment4>
