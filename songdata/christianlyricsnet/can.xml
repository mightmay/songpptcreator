		<segment1>Right now I think it's time it be known. Just how I feel about you Father, Savior. I'm sure that you see what's in my heart. But just vision's not enough I've got to tell you. More than tell you, anyone can say the words. I want to be the one to show you how I feel. You're too much, more that I could know. Just my way to say, I can't let go of you. Chorus: I can't let go of you. No matter what the world may tell you. I can't let go of you. No matter what the world may tell you. Right now you are all that I am. It's not I, but it's you that liveth in me. Where would I be, if you ever were to go. But I know that you'll never leave me nor forsake me. You've brought me, into so much light. You've kept me safe even at times I left your side. What would I do, if I weren't saved by you. Can't even imagine that's why I can't let go of you. (chorus). (bridge). (chorus).     </segment1>
