		<segment1>Be careful little eyes what you see. It's the second glance that ties your hands as darkness pulls the strings. Be careful little feet where you go. For it's the little feet behind you that are sure to follow</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: It's a slow fade when you give yourself away. It's a slow fade when black and white have turned to gray. And thoughts invade, choices are made, a price will be paid. When you give yourself away. People never crumble in a day</segment2>
		<segment3>It's a slow fade, it's a slow fade</segment3>
		<segment4>Be careful little ears what you hear. When flattery leads to compromise, the end is always near. Be careful little lips what you say. For empty words and promises lead broken hearts astray</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>The journey from your mind to your hands. Is shorter than you're thinking. Be careful if you think you stand. You just might be sinking </segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>Daddies never crumble in a day. Families never crumble in a day</segment8>
		<segment9>*Oh be careful little eyes what you see. Oh be careful little eyes what you see. For the Father up above is looking down in love. Oh be careful little eyes what you see*    </segment9>
