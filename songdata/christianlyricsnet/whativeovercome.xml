		<segment1>I've got this passion. It's something I can't describe. It's so electric. It's like I've just come alive</segment1>
		<segment2>I feel this freedom. Now that my past is erased. I feel the healing. I've found the meaning of grace. (I've found grace)</segment2>
		<segment3>If only You come see me yesterday. Who I used to be before I change. You'd see a broken heart. You'd see the battle scars</segment3>
		<segment4>Funny how words can't explain. How good it finally feels to break the chains. I'm not what I have done. I'm what I've overcome</segment4>
		<segment5>I know I stumble. I know I still face defeat. This second chance is. What will define me</segment5>
		<segment6>So I'm moving forward. I'm standing on my two feet. I've got momentum. I've got someone saving me. (got someone saving me)</segment6>
		<segment7>If only You come see me yesterday. Who I used to be before I change. You'd see a broken heart. You'd see the battle scars</segment7>
		<segment8>Funny how words cant explain. How good it finally feels to break the chains. I'm not what I have done. I'm what I've overcome</segment8>
		<segment9>I make mistakes and I might fall. But I won't break. I've got someone saving me</segment9>
		<segment10>If only You could see me yesterday. Who I used to be before I change. You'd see a broken heart. You'd see the battle scars</segment10>
		<segment11>Funny how words cant explain. How good it finally feels to break the chains. I'm not what I have done. I'm what I've overcome. I'm what I've overcome. I'm what I've overcome.     </segment11>
