		<segment1>I hear about you and all the things, the things that you do, and the hurt that it brings. I don't understand your reasoning and I don't know why. You think that you can do things your way. A fool can only satisfy himself. My life's not perfect as you can see. It's just that I possess a broken heart. You claim to believe in forgiving love. Forgiveness is yours if you'd look up above. I can't understand your reasoning and I don't know why. You think that you can do things your way    </segment1>
