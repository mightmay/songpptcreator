		<segment1>The dial tone is misleading my heart. </segment1>
		<segment2>I stop to fall apart.</segment2>
		<segment3>They say its fine for you to have a self centered point of view.</segment3>
		<segment4>Im alone and the telephone asks me where you are.</segment4>
		<segment5>Spiraling up the cord i caught your perfect little lie.</segment5>
		<segment6>Dont stay. I never knew you anyways</segment6>
		<segment7>Dont stay. Save your own skin</segment7>
		<segment8>Dont stay. While you go, go dig deep a foxhole for one.</segment8>
		<segment9>Red as wine I see the drugs in your eyes. </segment9>
		<segment10>Not a big surprise.</segment10>
		<segment11>Ive had it up to here with your stupid little point of view</segment11>
		<segment12>So put on your shoes! yeah go drink your booze!</segment12>
		<segment13>Youve drained all of my sympathy.</segment13>
		<segment14>Let me be so I can gracefully resign.    </segment14>
