		<segment1>We Stand Tired And Tested. Our Hearts Resurrected. One Truth This Is What We Live And Die For. We Fight With Conviction. No Time For Excuses. One Life It's Our Only Chance. To Take A Stand </segment1>
		<segment2>Try To Make A Stand [x2] </segment2>
		<segment3>Make The Most Of Every Day You Live. Choose The Day It Just Might Be Your Last. No Regrets We Have No Time To Wait. Take Control We've Got.     </segment3>
