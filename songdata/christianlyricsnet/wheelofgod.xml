		<segment1>I wanna ride on the wheel of God. While it's spinning round. I wanna ride on that wheel, while it's spinning round. Wheel within a wheel within.. wheel within a mighty wheel. Wheel within a wheel within.. wheel within a mighty wheel. I wanna go where no man on Earth has gone before. You know I do. I wanna go where no man's gone before. I saw a wheel way high up in the air and I said. I'm going to ride that wheel today, today. We'll go where no man's gone before. We'll see what no one's seen before. We'll go where no one's gone before. It's a wheel within a mighty wheel    </segment1>
