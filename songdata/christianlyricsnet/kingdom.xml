		<segment1>Stand up and heed heaven's call. Coming to us one and all. To live love and give love. To those who don't know of. The lavish and true love of God</segment1>
		<segment2>We are the kingdom of God. We are an army of love. We carry truth to the world. We are the kingdom of God </segment2>
		<segment3>Now join together as one. The time for rejoicing has come. Evil will tremble. When God's saints assemble. Yes, now His salvation is here </segment3>
		<segment4>I am, you are, we are the kingdom     </segment4>
