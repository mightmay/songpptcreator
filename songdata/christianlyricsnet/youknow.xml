		<segment1>It's dark in this valley, really. I can't see the sky spite the trees. Wouldn't fall so easy, maybe, if I would just stay down on my knees. Now I sit with my head in my hands. and I stare at the tear stained sand. Don't you know man I heard what you said, </segment1>
		<segment2>but it got lost in that space in my head.</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: You say that know and you say that feel. I know in my heart that there is something more real. It's sweet in your mouth so you don't spit out. and now it's going burn you from the inside out, but you say, &quot;It's taking the pain away.&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I'm alone, really. Alone and as my eyes can see. Wouldn't feel so alone, maybe, if I would just stay down on my knees. Now I sit with my head in my hands. and I stare at the tear stained sand. Don't you know man, I heard what you said, but it got lost in the space in my head.</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause you say that know, but the harder you try the lower you go. Don't you now there's a cure that take it away?    </segment6>
