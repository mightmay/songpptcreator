		<segment1>Heaven came to earth in a small package. For a child was born, a gift to man. Yes the living light came to the darkness. Wore the harness of mankind</segment1>
		<segment2>Laid His body down to be sin for us. Gave His earthly crown so we could be kings. Yes He came to break the yoke of darkness. That would harness all mankind</segment2>
		<segment3>This morning star of love still shines (and shines). We buried Him within our sin but He rose again</segment3>
		<segment4>Gave His heart away so we could find Him. Changed our night to day so we'd live in light. Tore the veil between the light and darkness. Broke the harness for mankind</segment4>
		<segment5>This morning star of love still shines (and shines). We buried Him within our sin but He rose again</segment5>
		<segment6>Let our hearts rejoice in Christ our Savior. Let us come before His throne with praise. Let us pray for peace so we'll break the darkness. Melt the hardness of mankind    </segment6>
