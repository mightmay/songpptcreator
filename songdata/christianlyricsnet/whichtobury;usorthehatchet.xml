		<segment1>I think you know what I'm getting at. i find it so upsetting that. The memories that you select. You keep the bad but the good you just forget</segment1>
		<segment2>And even though I'm angry I can still say. I know my heart will break the day. When you peel out and drive away. I can't believe this happened</segment2>
		<segment3>And all this time I never thought. That all we had would be all for naught</segment3>
		<segment4>No, I don't hate you. Don't want to fight you. Know I'll always love you. But right now I just don't like you. Know I don't hate you. Don't want to fight you. Know I'll always love you. But right now I just dont like you. Cause you took this too far</segment4>
		<segment5>Make your decision and don't you dare think twice. Go with your instincts along with some bad advice. This didn't turn out the way I thought it would at all. You blame me but some of this is still your fault</segment5>
		<segment6>I tried to move you, but you wouldn't budge. I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge. I think you know what I'm getting at. You said good-bye and I just don't want you regretting that</segment6>
		<segment7>And wisdom always chooses. These black eyes and these bruises. Over the heartache that they say. Never completly goes away. (I just can't believe this happend. And one day we'll see this come around)</segment7>
		<segment8>What happend to us. I heard that it's me we should blame. What happend to us. Why didn't you stop me from turning out this way. And know that I don't hate you. And know that I don't want to fight you. And know that I'll always love you. But right now I just don't..    </segment8>
