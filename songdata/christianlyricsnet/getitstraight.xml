		<segment2>Take a step back chump it's the word don't you know it. Strictly hardcore underground is how I flow it. I show it, and let it be known this good news. I live my life for Christ but you live how you choose. We rock a show we rock some more, He gets the glory. 'Cause this is how we preach His word and tell His stroy. 'Cause when it comes to my God there ain't no playing around. We either get on our knees, or we can get down. And we can get down. So, come and get some of this christianity. Dedicated my life, now I'm a soldier of G.O.D. I stuff His words in your face 'cause you know I can. You heard this before, I don't care, hear it again. This is your final warning. Yeah, get it straight. So come and get a piece of His love before it's too late. We bless you Lord, you're my God and you're my life. That's how we do, so what that P.O.D. like?. Now what my G-O-D like?    </segment2>
