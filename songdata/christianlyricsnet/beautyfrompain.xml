		<segment1>The lights go out all around me. One last candle to keep out the night. And then the darkness surrounds me. I know I'm alive. But I feel like I've died</segment1>
		<segment2>And all that's left is to accept that it's over. My dreams ran like sand through the fists that I made. I try to keep warm but I just grow colder. I feel like I'm slipping away</segment2>
		<segment3>After all this has passed. I still will remain. After I've cried my last. There'll be beauty from pain. Though it won't be today. Someday I'll hope again. And there'll be beauty from pain. You will bring beauty from my pain</segment3>
		<segment4>My whole world is the pain inside me. The best I can do is just get through the day. When life before is only a memory. I wonder why God let me walk through this place</segment4>
		<segment5>And though I can't understand why this happened. I know that I will when I look back someday. And see how You've brought beauty from ashes. And made me as gold purified through these flames</segment5>
		<segment6>Here and I am at the end of me (at the end of me). Trying to hold to what I can't see. I forgot how to hope. This night's been so long. I cling to your promise there will be a dawn.     </segment6>
