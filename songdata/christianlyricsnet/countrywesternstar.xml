		<segment1>I wish that I was Floyd Cramer. I'd pound out a country song. A cowboy, his keyboard. A Country Western Star</segment1>
		<segment2>That's not where I belong. No that's not where I belong. Just a sad, sad song. Would be so wrong</segment2>
		<segment3>I think that singin' is great. The melody is in place. But I can't play guitar</segment3>
		<segment4>Be a country star. Be a country star. I could never be a country star. And leave without a trace</segment4>
		<segment5>You dreamed you met Merle Haggard. A country superstar. You shared the stage of Farm Aid. And dreamed of going far</segment5>
		<segment6>Is that where you belong. Ask God where you belong. In the end will they say. &quot;He just sang country songs?&quot;.     </segment6>
