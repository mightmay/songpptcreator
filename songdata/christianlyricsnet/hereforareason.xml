		<segment1>The silent stars they sing so loud of . The only voice youÂ’ll ever hear from them oh that . Oh of their creator . And as I stand beneath the solemn sky . I wonder what it was like . To be where you created all you see . . And now I turn to you my God the one . The one who formed me . And loved me from the beginning . . My God he knows every star up there . Because he knows oh just where he wanted them . Them to be . The same goes for me and you my friends . The God who placed the stars above us placed you here . Here for a reason . . And now I turn to you my God the one . The one who formed me . And loved me from the beginning. . And now I turn to you my God the one . The one who formed me . And loved me from the beginning      </segment1>
