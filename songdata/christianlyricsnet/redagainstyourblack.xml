		<segment1>Ive made up my mind. And your not gonna change it this time. I don't care what you did yesterday. And i know what you'll do tomorrow. when you run away. i will bring you back. Oh my love is the red against your black.</segment1>
		<segment2>. The dead will live again. You will see those dry bones dancing. In a death defyin marvolous parade. ill make you strong. ill make you brave. when you run away. i will bring you back. Oh my love is the red against your black. when you run away. i will bring you back. Oh my love is the red against your black.</segment2>
		<segment3>. I ran a thousand miles for you. Oh and you will break my heart. and iiii will do it all again. because i couldn't stand to be apart. when you run away. i will bring you back. Oh my love is the red against your black. when you run away. i will bring you back. Oh my love is the red against your black. Yes my love is the red against your black.    </segment3>
