		<segment1>I know I need You. I need to love You. I'd love to see You but it's been so long</segment1>
		<segment2>I long to feel You. I feel this need for You. I need to hear You. Is that so wrong?</segment2>
		<segment3>Now You pull me near You. When we're close I fear You. Still I'm afraid to tell you all that I've done</segment3>
		<segment4>Are You done forgiving?. Can You look past my pretending?. I'm so tired of defending what I've become. What have I become?</segment4>
		<segment5>But I hear You say. My love is over. It's underneath. It's inside. It's in between</segment5>
		<segment6>The times that you doubt me. And when you can't feel. The times that you question. Is this for real?</segment6>
		<segment7>The times that you're broken. The times that you mend. The times you hate me. The times that you bend</segment7>
		<segment8>My love is over. It's underneath. It's inside. It's in between</segment8>
		<segment9>The times that you're healing. And when your heart breaks. The times that you feel like you've fallen from grace</segment9>
		<segment10>The times that you're hurting. The times that you heal. The times you go hungry and are tempted to steal</segment10>
		<segment11>In times of confusion. In chaos and pain. I'm there in your sorrow under the weight of your shame</segment11>
		<segment12>I'm there through your heart-ache. I'm there in the storm. My love I will keep you by my power alone</segment12>
		<segment13>I don't care where you've fallen or where you have been. I'll never forsake you. My love never ends. It never ends</segment13>
