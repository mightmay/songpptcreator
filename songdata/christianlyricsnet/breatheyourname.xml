		<segment1>It's every day. I'm in this place. I feel this way. I feel the same. It's every day. I'm in this place. I feel this way. I feel the same</segment1>
		<segment2>Is it all inside my head. Is it all inside my head. I view the list. And take my pick. I view my **faith**. And make a choice. 'Cause it's nobody else's but mine</segment2>
		<segment3>But you're in my heart. I can feel your beat. And you move my mind. From behind the wheel. When I lose control. I can only breathe your name. I can only breathe your name</segment3>
		<segment4>So many days within this race. I need the truth. I need some grace. I need the path. To find my place. I need some truth. I need some grace. The part of you. That's part of me. Will never die. Will never leave. And it's nobody else's but mine</segment4>
		<segment5>You are in my heart. I can feel your beat. And you move my mind. From behind the wheel. When I lose control. I can only breathe your name. I can only breathe your name</segment5>
		<segment6>You'll view the list. And take your pick. You'll view my **faith**. And make a choice. 'Cause I'm nobody else's but yours</segment6>
		<segment7>And you're in my heart. I can feel you're beat. And you move my mind. From behind the wheel. When I lose control. I can only breathe your name</segment7>
		<segment8>'Cause you're in my heart. I can feel your beat. And you move my mind. From behind the wheel. When I lose control. I can only breathe your name. I can only breathe your name. I can only breathe your name. I can only breathe your name    </segment8>
