		<segment1>so the notion of a fiery end put me to sleep again. nothing imploring. tragically boring. when heads hit pillows tonight it may be the last time</segment1>
		<segment2>throw it away. I could be sadder I suppose. I should be shedding tears and spouting prose. one last time. Not much to say I wish I felt something more concrete. something where I could plant my feet and try to breathe. one last time</segment2>
		<segment3>honestly there's nothing more. no revelation on this darkened shore. i can't sleep so what's the difference what's the use?. if you fell in love with me I couldn't fall in love with you</segment3>
		<segment4>I know what you are thinking. I know you wish I wouldn't say. I know what you are thinking. I know you wish I wouldn't. be so blatant, indifferent. give me a reason not to say    </segment4>
