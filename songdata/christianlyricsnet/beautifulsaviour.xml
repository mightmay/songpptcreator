		<segment1>All my days I will sing this song of gladness. Give my praise to the Fountain of delights. For in my helplessness You heard my cry. And waves of mercy poured down on my life</segment1>
		<segment2>I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer. I will sing of the blood that never fails. Of sins forgiven of conscience cleansed. Of death defeated and life without end</segment2>
		<segment3>Beautiful Saviour Wonderful Counsellor. Clothed in majesty Lord of history. You're the Risen One heaven's Champion. And You reign You reign over all</segment3>
		<segment4>I long to be where the praise is never-ending. Yearn to dwell where the glory never fades. Where countless worshippers will share one song. And cries of &quot;worthy&quot; will honour the Lamb    </segment4>
