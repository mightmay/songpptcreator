		<segment1>Meeting you was just so unexpected. I guess I was scared of being rejected </segment1>
		<segment2>Since you were so nice. I wouldn't think twice. I'd give it all away for one more day with you </segment2>
		<segment3>If ever there was a girl to be engaged to. That amazing girl would have to be you </segment3>
		<segment4>Before we hung out. Don't know how I lived without. Your beautiful face - like God's amazing grace </segment4>
		<segment5>Andrea, I say your name and all I can do is. Think about the way you smiled. And kinda sorta held my hand. Went out for coffee in what must have been the smallest town in Kentucky </segment5>
		<segment6>Andrea, we walked together. Down the dirt road by the bridge. That we sat by each other. Talked about a few things. You looked at me I looked at you. Before you know, it's time to go!    </segment6>
