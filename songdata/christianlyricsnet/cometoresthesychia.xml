		<segment1>Sit down in the carousel. Up front like a brave boy. Don't scream like a little girl. Shut up boys don't cry</segment1>
		<segment2>Come to a rest that flows. From a spring unseen. Cause honestly you're scaring me</segment2>
		<segment3>Keep up with the schedule. Shape up, have to perform. Hold out for everyone. Don't fail not now</segment3>
		<segment4>Come to a rest that flows. From a spring unseen. Cause honestly you're scaring me</segment4>
		<segment5>Failure is not an option. Have to keep on trying</segment5>
		<segment6>So much to live up to. So many expectations. Trying so hard to be approved. A straight A student with yet another F. Oh no gotta make daddy proud now</segment6>
		<segment7>Come to a rest that flows. From a spring unseen. Cause honestly you're scaring me</segment7>
		<segment8>Failure is not an option. Have to keep on trying. So much pressure. Can't take this no more. The cause of death. Suicide    </segment8>
