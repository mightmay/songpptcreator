		<segment1>Take it to the Lord in prayer. He's not a man that he he should lie. so Mary wipe your weeping eyes. Cause he is the balm in Gilead. He's yet alive. My God's not dead</segment1>
		<segment2>Chrous: Put your hand in the hand of the man that. stilled the water. Put your hand in the hand of the man that. calmed to sea</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Like a ship that's tossed and drivin'. Battered by an angry sea. When the storms of life are raging. And that spirit falls on me. I know in him i found a friend. Who's gonna be there untill the end. I have no doubt he can work it out. And then I come through i'll lift my. hands and shout</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chrous:)</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes I wonder how I made it over</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chrous:)</segment6>
		<segment7>Every time I move I lose. When I let sin in. Now it's time to turn around. Back with God again    </segment7>
