		<segment1>I see you smile, See you lighting up the sky, Through the rain, love will shine for you and I, We'll fly. Will you dance, through the storm that made you cry, Spinning round, winter's come but you and I, We'll fly. With you I'll be free, with you I'll be me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Waiting for the summer, we'll be laughing, We'll be dancing, shining in the sun, You're my beautiful one. Waiting for the summer, we'll be laughing, We'll be dancing, nothing more to say, It's a beautiful day.</segment2>
		<segment3>I see you smile, you're not living for this life, Innocence, you remind us how it can, Be right. And you make me free, Come away our dreams will be.    </segment3>
