		<segment1>Rid me of the notion that I ever had any rights. Cleanse me of the motives that come in such a clever disguise. Ruin my agenda, holy as it never was </segment1>
		<segment2>It's all from Your hand. and there's nothing that's mine. and all that You give. You're free to take away </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm just trying to hold on, clinging to the dream inside. I was only selfish, and you were only part of my life </segment3>
		<segment4>Every breath, every word. There isn't one thing I deserve. And all that I am is Yours    </segment4>
