		<segment1>It is not safe to assume that I am like me.. In anyway. I do not even like the taste of broken words or broken promises. I will not waste my time here. </segment1>
		<segment2>I know what I've been called to be. I know it won't include me. You're trouble, You're wasted. You know I just won't take this. Sink or Swim </segment2>
		<segment3>There is no place for you in what I am called to do. Heart undergraced, I do not understand the way.. You curse, you bend my words, you just praise Jesus to be heard. When will we ever learn?    </segment3>
