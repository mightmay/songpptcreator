		<segment1>Consider the kindness of a stranger. That passes by your way. For there are ties that bind us. Together, forever</segment1>
		<segment2>Touching the broken-hearted friend. Brings healing to the soul within. Theres evidence everywhere. Of His love, sweet love</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. God is all around us. Even when we feel were all alone. I can hear Him whispering my name. Telling me that Im His own. God is all around us. Even when we feel all hope is gone</segment3>
		<segment4>God is all around. God is all around</segment4>
		<segment5>Theyre so many lessons yet to learn. And I dont know where the road will turn. He always finds a way. To guide me, remind me</segment5>
		<segment6>That if I should fall into the night. He will be there, a shining light. For all the world to see. With open arms for you and me</segment6>
		<segment7>Repeat Chorus</segment7>
		<segment8>God is all around (Hell hear your prayers). If you just reach out (Hes everywhere). God is everywhere</segment8>
		<segment9>God is all around us. When you feel all alone. Cant you hear Him whispering your name. Telling you that youre His own. For God is all around. God is all around     </segment9>
