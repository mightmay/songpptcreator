		<segment1>It only took a moment. To turn my life around. The sky was cracked wide open. It tore these four walls down</segment1>
		<segment2>It was the light of the sun</segment2>
		<segment3>The beauty that surrounded me. Was like nothing I had seen. The sky was filled with colors. And all creation sings</segment3>
		<segment4>I never wanted anymore. Than I could fit inside my hands, inside my hands. It was the light of the sun.     </segment4>
