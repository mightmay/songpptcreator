		<segment1>you'd like to think i have it easy at times i think you're right but then i take a look around and see your eyes on me at times i think i have it easy until i close my eyes and see this life in my box lets you turn the key when you want to hear a melody but i can never be the apple of your eye the story of your life it's what's insideY i go through stages when i feel this matters this song and dance is a way of life for meY you'd like to think i have it easy at times i think your right but then i take a look around and see the grass is always greener on the other side and i can never be the one who saves the day i'm just the man in the music boxY it's nothing special i'm just the man in the music box (your music box superhero)Y i will never be your superhero.     </segment1>
