		<segment1>Weathered by the New York sun. The elevator, Twenty-seven seconds later. She finds herself in the middle of his room. The taxicab is right outside</segment1>
		<segment2>This is our time. Without a doubt I know this is our time. This is our time to stand alone. It is time to say goodbye</segment2>
		<segment3>Severed From her only love. Out the window. His heart canÂ’t stay at bay. She finds herself in the back seat of a lie. Drive on Drive far away</segment3>
		<segment4>Get up and go!.     </segment4>
