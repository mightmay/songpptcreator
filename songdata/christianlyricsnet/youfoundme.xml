		<segment1>I was all on my own with nowhere to run to. On the day You found me. And the more that I pray, the more that I hear You. And the more I believe. That no one else could hold me like You do. We're never apart</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I want to tell You. I want to let You know. And I want to show You the way I feel for You. I didn't know You. Now anyone can see. You are my God. And You found me</segment2>
		<segment3>I will never deny the way that You lead me. With the love that's so rare. So I made up my mind whenever You need me. I will always be there. And no one else could hold me like You do. We're never apart</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>And every day I'm gonna say how I'm feeling. In every way I want to show how I care. My life was all wrong, but I know from now on. I'll never stop loving You    </segment5>
