		<segment1>You want something you take it. Can't hide from God can't fake it. He knows your heart he knows mine. You've only got a lifetime </segment1>
		<segment2>Have you no integrity?. Your wasted mind, your apathy. Same old high school mystery. You're too dumb &amp; blind to see </segment2>
		<segment3>You've already made up your mind. You don't care you don't wanna find. The truth will hit you like cement. Too bad too sad it's too late for your enlightenment.     </segment3>
