		<segment1>Carry on my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more</segment1>
		<segment2>Once I rose above the noise and confusion. Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion. I was soaring ever higher. But I flew too high</segment2>
		<segment3>Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man. Though my mind could think I still was a mad man. I hear the voices when I'm dreaming. I can hear them say</segment3>
		<segment4>Carry on my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more</segment4>
		<segment5>Masquerading as a man with a reason. My charade is the event of the season. And if I claim to be a wise man, well. It surely means that I don't know</segment5>
		<segment6>On a stormy sea of moving emotion. Tossed around like a ship on the ocean. I set a course for winds of fortune. But I hear the voices say</segment6>
		<segment7>Carry on my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more, No! </segment7>
		<segment8>Carry on, you will always remember. Carry on, nothing equals the splendor. Now your life's no longer empty. Surely heaven waits for you</segment8>
		<segment9>Carry on my wayward son. There'll be peace when you are done. Lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry. Don't you cry no more!     </segment9>
