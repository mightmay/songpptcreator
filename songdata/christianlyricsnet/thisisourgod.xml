		<segment1>A refuge for the poor, a shelter from the storm. This is our God. He will wipe away your tears and return your. wasted years. This is our God. Oh.. this is our God. A father to the orphan, a healer to the broken. This is our God. And he brings peace to our madness and comfort. in our sadness</segment1>
		<segment2>This is our God. Oh.. this is our God. this is the one we have waited for. Oh.. this is our God. A fountain for the thirsty, a lover for the lonely. This is our God. He brings glory to the humble and crowns for the. faithful. This is our God    </segment2>
