		<segment1>I put my hope in you. I lay my life in the palm of your hand. I'm constantly drawn to you O Lord. In ways I cannot comprehend</segment1>
		<segment2>It's the creator calling the created. The maker beckoning the made. The bride finding what she's always waited for. When we find ourselves that day</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: In you where the hungry feast at the table. The blind frozen by colors in view. The lame will dance, they'll dance for they are able. And the weary find rest. O the weary find rest in you</segment3>
		<segment4>It's no secret that we don't belong here. though set apart by the grace of you. We look for the day when we go to a place. Where the old become brand new</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: In you where the hungry feast at the table. The blind frozen by colors in view. The lame will dance, they'll dance for they are able. And the weary find rest. O the weary find rest in you..</segment5>
		<segment6>where the hungry feast at the table. The blind frozen by colors in view. The lame will dance, they'll dance for they are able. And the weary find rest. O we will find rest in you</segment6>
		<segment7>na na na na naa naa na na na na. we will find hope. (na na na na). o we will find rest. (na na na na). you are our refuge. (na na na na). you are our sanctuary. (na na na na). we come you lord    </segment7>
