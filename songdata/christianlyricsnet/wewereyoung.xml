		<segment1>We were young they say. They have got some they'll never take away. We thought we knew everything. But that never mattered much to me. Remember those times. When you felt that you'd do anything. To do something that feels right. We didn't give a say. Never ones who ever changed a thing. There were those who truly cared. And to those ones I owe everything. [Chorus]. You were young. So full of love. Don't wait. Don't take your time. Wait for nothing now. Wait for nothing now. Wait for nothing now.     </segment1>
