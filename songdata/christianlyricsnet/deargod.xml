		<segment1>Dear God I wrote this letter, To put my thoughts on paper, Sometimes life seems like a criminal, Without a well planned caper. I know You're the answer, But I forget the question, How do I know You love me, When no one else, seems to care</segment1>
		<segment2>I've tried everything I thought, Might help me understand things, And it didn't tell me anything, Or even play my heart strings. So I'm writing You this letter, To wait for Your reply, I am so tired, of not believing, I'll give You a try</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't know, but I got this feeling, That today's gonna be my turning point, Everyday I get a little bit closer, It feels so good to finally be over. I don't know, but I think I'm learning, This type of thing, Never been my calling card, Sometimes you just gotta look closer, Instead of searchin' so hard</segment3>
		<segment4>So when I start to get down, And the world fills up around me, And my head starts. Spinnin' like a top, From the way my heart beat's pounding. I can look up for a second, And know that I'm alright, I spent so long, not believing, It's my turn to fly</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't know, but I got this feeling, That today's gonna be my turning point, Everyday I get a little bit closer, It feels so good to finally be over. And I don't know, but I think I'm learning, This type of thing, never. Been my calling card, Sometimes you just gotta look closer, Instead of searchin' so hard    </segment5>
