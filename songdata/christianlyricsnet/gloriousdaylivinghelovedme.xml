		<segment1>One day when Heaven was filled with His praises. One day when sin was as black as could be. Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin. Dwelt among men, my example is He. Word became flesh and the light shined among us. His glory revealed</segment1>
		<segment2>Living, He loved me. Dying, He saved me. Buried, He carried my sins far away. Rising, He justified freely forever. One day Hes coming. Oh glorious day, oh glorious day</segment2>
		<segment3>One day they led Him up Calvarys mountain. One day they nailed Him to die on a tree. Suffering anguish, despised and rejected. Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He. Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree. And took the nails for me</segment3>
		<segment4>One day the grave could conceal Him no longer. One day the stone rolled away from the door. Then He arose, over death He had conquered. Now Hes ascended, my Lord evermore. Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him. From rising again</segment4>
		<segment5>One day the trumpet will sound for His coming. One day the skies with His glories will shine. Wonderful day, my Beloved One, bringing. My Savior, Jesus, is mine</segment5>
