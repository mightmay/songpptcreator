		<segment1>One last disguise</segment1>
		<segment2>Pawns standing in awe of the game. Of the stage. You've worked so hard at building an empire. Of secret rooms to display yourself. And add to your wealth. The sting of. Oh, it stings. When I saw it all come crashing. I witnessed the sound of a million voices. Screaming for a public hanging</segment2>
		<segment3>So hide yourself, hide, hide yourself for now. (2x)</segment3>
		<segment4>We caught you plotting murder. And now the Tide is Turning. We'll light our souls, heal our bones. Upon your empire burning (2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>When the world is a target for humanity's market. And all of it's sold for a dime. I've seen the towers of gods. And the power of men. In disguises of the worst kind. I am the words on the page. I am the death among life today. I am the voice of one among the silent. Who's tired of burning among the flames</segment5>
		<segment6>So hide yourself, hide, hide yourself for now. (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>We caught you plotting murder. And now the Tide is Turning. We'll light our souls, heal our bones. Upon your empire burning (2x)</segment7>
		<segment8>I do not need anymore truthless heroes (3x). We don't need no truthless heroes</segment8>
		<segment9>So hide yourself, hide, hide yourself for now. (2x)</segment9>
		<segment10>We caught you plotting murder. And now the Tide is Turning. We'll light our souls, heal our bones. Upon your empire burning (2x)</segment10>
		<segment11>I need truth    </segment11>
