		<segment1>Shake it, shake it. The time has come to break it. Anyway you make it, it's goin' down. People gather 'round for the man above. We're goin' down, down with hate and up with love</segment1>
		<segment2>Can you understand what's the plan. Spread some love all across this land. What's the caper, spread the truth. Read it in the papers about the youth. Ya can't crumble and break from what somebody else thinks. Be tougher than that, lighten up your act. Let's talk about it, before it's too late. Don't push it to the side so that it can hide. What's done in the dark needs come to light. A heart full of hate's gonna waste a life. Represent for the positive, no prejudice is the way to live. You gotta free your mind, take your time. Put your hand in mine. 'Cause it's a brand new day</segment2>
