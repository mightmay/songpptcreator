		<segment1>Here we are at the start committing to each other. By His word and from our hearts. We will be a family in a house that will be a home. And with faith we'll build it strong </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: We'll build a household of faith. That together we can make. And when the strong winds blow it won't fall down. As one in Him we'll grow and the whole world will know. We are a household of faith </segment2>
		<segment3>Now to be a family we've got to love each other. At any cost unselfishly. And our home must be a place that fully abounds with grace. A reflection of His face </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus </segment4>
