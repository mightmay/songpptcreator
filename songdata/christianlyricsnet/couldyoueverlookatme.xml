		<segment1>Could you ever look me the way you're looking at the ocean. All wounded in your smile, but holy and unriled. Could you ever look at me?</segment1>
		<segment2>Could you ever look at me the way your looking at the sunrise?. How it settles on your face, whole and unafraid. Like the light of your world</segment2>
		<segment3>And I dont know how to chase away the fear I have inside me. And I dont know where it is you go when you drift away, when you drift away. Could you ever look at me the way you looking at the ocean    </segment3>
