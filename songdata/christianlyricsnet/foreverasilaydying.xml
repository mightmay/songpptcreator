		<segment1>Forever, your eyes will hold the memory. I saw your heart as it overtook me. We tried so hard to understand and reason. But in that one moment, I gave my heart away</segment1>
		<segment2>I gave my heart away. In that moment, I gave my heart away. In that moment, I gave my heart away</segment2>
		<segment3>With that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me. And all I knew is what had overtaken me. With no reason, I am comforted by inability to understand</segment3>
		<segment4>Forever, your eyes will hold the memory. I saw your heart as it overtook me. We tried so hard to understand and reason. But in that one moment, I gave my heart away</segment4>
		<segment5>I gave my heart away. In that moment, I gave my heart away. In that moment, I gave my heart away</segment5>
		<segment6>Forever your eyes will hold the memory. Forever your eyes will hold the memory. Forever your eyes will hold the memory</segment6>
		<segment7>When I wake from this dream. Will your smile still open my heart and leave me transparent?. When I wake from this dream. Will your smile still open my heart?    </segment7>
