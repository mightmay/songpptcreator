		<segment1>vs1. Around my neck is a beautiful stone. I made it from the good that I've done. It is close to my heart with a meter of its own. but the weight it bears on me from the good I want to be. it cuts me in half, a blade, a sword, a golden calf</segment1>
		<segment2>vs2. now I am sinking under the load. I see it was only foolÂ’s gold. And it falls on me, brings me low. Around his neck He carries the stone. He takes my burden, makes it his own. And it takes him down, the bread, the wine, the golden crown</segment2>
		<segment3>ch. Free</segment3>
		<segment4>vs3. a rose shoots up from the ground. the sky cracks open, sun through the clouds. the old has changed, the earth, the bride, the family name</segment4>
		<segment5>bridge. broken down and shot through, all the good I mean to do. the prison shakes, the man goes free, I am him and he is me</segment5>
		<segment6>ch    </segment6>
