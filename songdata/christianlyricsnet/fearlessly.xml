		<segment1>I am scared to move. From this frame of mind, afraid to lose. And I always try to find. Endless ways to hide my face from You</segment1>
		<segment2>But You say. Dont be afraid, and dont feel ashamed. Youre one breath away from the life youre meant to lead. Fearlessly</segment2>
		<segment3>Now its time to give. Every thought to You, so I can finally live. Cause theres no fear in love. Theres only hope in You. And Youre the one to pull me through. You pull me through</segment3>
		<segment4>When youre scared, and you cant see. I am here to bring you peace. When youre lost and out of reach. I am here, I am here. When youre scared, and you cant see I am here to give you peace. When youre lost and out of reach. I am here, I am here to give you peace I am here to give you peace</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I wont be afraid. I wont feel ashamed. I am one breath away from the life Im meant to lead. So I wont be afraid. No, I wont be ashamed. I am one breath away from the life Im meant to lead. Fearlessly    </segment5>
