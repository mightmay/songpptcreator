		<segment1>Humble me, humble me. Take my life, let it be. Pleasing only Lord, to Thee. Humble me. I am cold, I am hard. Lord, my heart is torn and scarred. Lay Your hand upon my life. And humble me. Humble me when You see me swiftly straying. Draw me near that I may hear Your Spirit saying.. Come to Me, come to Me. For I long to set you free. I know your heart, I Love you still. So come to Me    </segment1>
