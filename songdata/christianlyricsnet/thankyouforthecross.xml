		<segment1>THANK YOU FOR THE CROSS, The price You paid for us, How You gave Yourself, So completely, Precious Lord (precious Lord). Now our sins are gone, All forgiven, Covered by Your blood, All forgotten, Thank You, Lord (thank You, Lord).</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, I love You, Lord, Really love You, Lord. I will never understand. Why You love me. You're my deepest joy, You're my heart's desire, And the greatest thing of all, O Lord, I see: You delight in me!</segment2>
		<segment3>For our healing there, Lord, You suffered, And to take our fear. You poured out Your love, Precious Lord (precious Lord). Calvary's work is done, You have conquered, Able now to save. So completely, Thank You, Lord (thank You, Lord).</segment3>
