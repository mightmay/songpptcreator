		<segment1>the sound of silent voices surveying my thoughts. regularity defining perfection. neither sorrow nor contentment. whispering emptiness, frail words collapse. my weight only stirs the ground. how long can i hold your hand as you walk over graves. you search for tears of compassion. yet find the comfort of winter. reassurance dead like the falling leaves. losing hope in your unchanging ways. all of my strength cannot save you. if you are unwilling to help yourself    </segment1>
