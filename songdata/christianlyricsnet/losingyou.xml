		<segment1>Your persuasion has lead me here. The lies you told me were sincere. I never wanted to second guess it. It seems so real, how was I to know how you feel</segment1>
		<segment2>So I'll sleep alone. Even if I know it's hard to watch you go. Cause there's something that I must do. Even if I know it means</segment2>
		<segment3>All this time I took for granted. Always relied on second chances. Now my luck is finally running out. I'm so tired of always living in this shadow of doubt</segment3>
		<segment4>So I'll sleep alone. Even if I know it's hard to watch you go. Cause there's something that I must do. Even if I know it means losing you</segment4>
		<segment5>Fly away, don't be afraid. Never forget the memories that we made. All these times between us, Just close your eyes I'll be there</segment5>
		<segment6>So I'll sleep alone. Even if I know it's hard to watch you go. Cause there's something that I must do. Even if I know it means losing you    </segment6>
