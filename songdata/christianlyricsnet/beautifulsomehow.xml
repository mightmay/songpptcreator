		<segment2>Navigation: J  Joy Williams  Beautiful Somehow</segment2>
		<segment3>Never been a fashion queen. I wear dresses, I wear jeans. I've even been known to wear my heart on my sleeve. I'm just your average kid next door. A plain, simple mystery. I'm a self-proclaimed Daddy's girl. With my share of idiosyncrasies. But You love me for me</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. I'm just fine. I see a smile from Heaven. My Father is proud. I know that I am simply, fearfully and wonderfully. Made in You. You make it beautiful somehow</segment4>
		<segment5>I've got old fashioned sensibilities. I believe chivalry still exists. And I can be a princess. Even when there ain't no prince. So what if I'm right brained. I've got half a mind to disagree. I would rather write the book. Than go and read the movie</segment5>
		<segment6>So even when I may not rhyme. You always give me reason</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>Got my elbows on the table. My mind up in the clouds. I know I'm getting better. I can almost hear You laugh out loud. The more I trust in You. The more I find. What You create is no mistake. It's purpose by design</segment8>
		<segment9>CHORUS    </segment9>
