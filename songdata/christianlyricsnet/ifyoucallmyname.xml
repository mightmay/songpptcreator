		<segment1> I opened to door to my room and I thought of you. Painting my walls to the shade of your favorite blue. Dancing with a song in your head used to bother me. Now all I have is a song for some company</segment1>
		<segment2>In my bright imagination. Blamed my shaky shot at love on the wind. In the end guess all I want you to say. Is that you want me to stay</segment2>
		<segment3>If you called my name I would turn around. I would run to you. Sacrifice my shame I would follow, I would follow you</segment3>
		<segment4>Yesterdays gone so it's on with the rest of me. Should open my dreams with a dose of reality. And take another look at the bend in my history. Hoping that maybe you'll come chasing after me</segment4>
		<segment5>If you called my name I would turn around. I would run to you. Sacrifice my shame I would follow, I would follow you</segment5>
		<segment6>Should I pay my penance. Would my price be enough for you. If I've got nothing up my sleeve. Would you believe</segment6>
		<segment7>That if you called my name I would turn around. I would run to you. Sacrifice my shame I would follow, I would follow you.     </segment7>
