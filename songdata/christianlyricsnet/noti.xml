		<segment1>So now you're suffering the fallacy of what you said. When you uncover the depression from where you've tread. Breathe over the glass you wrote on. Swallow all that you waste your throat on. You wear the mark and wave the banner they made with sin. Revealing every single lie that you've been breeding within. Wash over the skin you've broken. Think over the tone you spoke in </segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-chorus]. So lost in your affliction / addiction. The solemn comfort your grave. If you close your eyes the light can't take it away </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Not I - I won't conform to what I see in you. Not I - I won't surrender what I am. Not I - And even if it was a part of me. Not I - I'll never be that way again </segment3>
		<segment4>The blind will follow on the path that you created in vain. No guiding light, but just the shadow of the dead will remain. Dig open the pain you're hiding. Give your hand to the faith you're fighting. The void you suffer is a curse forever bleeding inside. Now you embrace the fatal sickness you should despise. Remember the day you lost that. Where is the shame that will bring your soul back </segment4>
		<segment5>[Pre-chorus] </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>Reach back behind your pride. And pull the thorn from the burning pain in your side </segment7>
		<segment8>Sing me a new song. A broken song of redemption and regret. Sing me a new song. And beg for all the mercy you can get </segment8>
		<segment9>[Chorus] </segment9>
		<segment10>    </segment10>
