		<segment1>Closer away from the boundaries. I'm building to break from. Boundless and unrestrained. Building to break them all. We are built to see one way. But watching the lines blur. Our eyes have been gorged out. And fused to see another. I won't let this tear me out of the ground. I will defy the culture that rips me out. And tears me down. I will defy your culture and make this real. We will not die just to fade. Into the air like memories. We will not die. If we live in hearts we leave behind. Then we will never die. And you can't replace them. With the ones you've lost. We're escaping all of your securities    </segment1>
