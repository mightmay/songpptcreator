		<segment1>Verse 1</segment1>
		<segment2>Standing in Your presence. I breathe Your life. Leaving all behind to follow Christ. A thirst no one can quench wells up inside. Only you can open wells run dry. And I call out I'm cryin' out</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus 1</segment3>
		<segment4>Fill me to overflowing. Fill me so I am broken. With Your call I give my all to You. Fill me so I am changed. Fill me with Heaven's ways. A love for all so all men might be saved. Fill me</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 2</segment5>
		<segment6>Worlds are crying out to see Your sight. You are love and life my soul's delight. Nations open up to Your embrace. Help me shine the only name that saves. Fill me so I become like You    </segment6>
