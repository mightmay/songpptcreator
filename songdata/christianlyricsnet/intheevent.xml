		<segment1>Into the world. My heart is set in motion. Guided by a notion of faith. Still there are days. I'm drowning in the ocean. I hit my knees and fold my hands. Hoping that You'll understand</segment1>
		<segment2>And in the event You are listening. You're listening. And Jesus was sent to forgive me. Forgive me. Then in His name I'm petitioning. Petitioning. In the event You are listening. You're listening</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm closing my eyes. And counting all the blessings. Never second-guessing the truth. Yet there are times. I find myself confessing. That I need more than just a favor. I need someone. I need a Savior</segment3>
		<segment4>I wouldn't blame You. If You turned a deaf ear to the world. And never saved us. Nor forgave us. But You had mercy on us all</segment4>
		<segment5>And in His name I'm petitioning. Petitioning. In the event You are listening. You're listening. In every event You are listening. You're listening. And Jesus was sent to forgive me. Forgive me. And in His name I'm petitioning. Petitioning. In the event You are listening. You're listening, You're listening    </segment5>
