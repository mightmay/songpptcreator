		<segment1>What's it gonna take. to slow us down. to let the silence spin us around?. What's it gonna take. to drop this town?. We've been spinning at the speed of sound. </segment1>
		<segment2>Stepping out of those convenience stores. what could we want but more more more?. From the third world. to the corporate core. we are a symphony of modern humanity </segment2>
		<segment3>If we're adding to the noise. turn off this song. If we're adding to the noise. turn off your stereo, stereo, stereo </segment3>
		<segment4>I dont know. what they're gonna think of next. genetic engineers of the most high tech. A couple new ways. to fall into debt. I'm a nervous wreck but I'll bet. that that T.V. set. tells us what we've wanted to hear. But none of these sound bites. are coming in clear. From the third world to the corporate ear. we are the symphony of modern humanity.    </segment4>
