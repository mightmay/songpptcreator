		<segment1>Turn up the light so we can see. The redhead grandson on your knee. You'd better hold him while you can. He'll be walking soon. This time next year. You'll want to take him. Down the old road. Behind your house </segment1>
		<segment2>To show him the sun. On the autumn fields, Smell the wind-blown alfalfa, To look out where the geese. Are rising for their southern flight. Circling arrows in the sky. Above the ditches. And the cottonwoods </segment2>
		<segment3>This time next year. There'll be stories to tell. And he will listen to you. Quiet in your arms. And there'll be songs to sing him. While he goes to sleep. When we gather in your home. This time next year </segment3>
		<segment4>The boy is laughing on your knee. Hold him up so we can see. Hold him high because. We're lifted in his laughter. And in the gladness. He has brought you. As you walk these heavy miles    </segment4>
