		<segment1>Wish I had what I needed. To be on my own. Cause I feel so defeated. And I'm feeling alone. And it all seems so helpless. And I have no plans. I'm a plane in the sunset. With no where to land. And all I see. It could never make me happy. And all my sandcastles. Spend their time collapsing </segment1>
		<segment2>Let me know that you hear me. Let me know your touch. Let me know that you love me. Let that be enough </segment2>
		<segment3>It's my birthday tomorrow. No one here could know. I was born this thursday. Twenty-two years ago. And I feel stuck watching history repeating. Oh am I just a kid who knows he's needy? </segment3>
		<segment4>Let me know that you hear me. Let me know your touch. Let me know that you love me. Let that be enough </segment4>
		<segment5>Let me know that you hear me. Let me know your touch. Let me know that you love me. Let that be enough    </segment5>
