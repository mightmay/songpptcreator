		<segment1>Walk through the streets of PA and you may see her. Go up to her and say you're a believer. Disgusting trash on MTV it makes her smile. That guy from Satan's embassy put him on trial.</segment1>
		<segment2>Because.. Marilyn Manson ate my girlfriend. Satan consumed her mind, and he may do it again. Marylin Manson ate my girlfriend. She once believed in the truth, now she belives in sin.</segment2>
		<segment3>She denies God when she has the chance to live for him. The thought of it makes me cringe. Her future looks dim. She'd rather gaze in Satan's eyes than on a steeple. I'm really starting to despise beautiful people.    </segment3>
