		<segment1>Round and round this world we go. Forming truths from what we know. It could never be foretold. What will happen tomorrow. Things we see right now will change. Our lives will never be the same. Praying hallowed be thy name. And I am lifted from my shame. And I know this will not be in vain</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: A moment in time has passed before my eyes. There's more to this life, there's more to this life. I'm struggling to fight the reasons we cry. There's more to this life, there's more to this life</segment2>
		<segment3>Time will tell as hours go. The truth inside will soon unfold. Revealing secrets as we grow. Into a brand new tomorrow. The plan is already in place. Transcending love through time and space. Strong and humbled by His grace. Catching tear drops from my face. And I know I will not be ashamed</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>And if it's peace you seek. Let me wash away the blood that's drawn. And soak up all the tears upon my sleeve. And if you'll kneel with me. Well I will pray for our forgiveness. To the only One who'll truly make us clean</segment5>
