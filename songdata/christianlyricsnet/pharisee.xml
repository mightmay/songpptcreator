		<segment1>Hear no evil, see no evil. Speak no evil. On the outside. Full of pride, full of lies. So well they hide. On the inside</segment1>
		<segment2>They'll never be. All that they seem. They live the life of a Pharisee</segment2>
		<segment3>Not perfect on the surface T So far to go T On the outside. But a true heart T And a new start is what lives on the inside</segment3>
		<segment4>For whom the Son has set free. He is free. Free indeed</segment4>
		<segment5>Receive the Son who makes us free. Then you will be free indeed    </segment5>
