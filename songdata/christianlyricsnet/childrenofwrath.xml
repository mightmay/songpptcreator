		<segment1>Take a bite of the sickness and feel the rush of your desire. When you act upon your urges, so begins a period of decent. Deception.</segment1>
		<segment2>I am a tainted man with a wretched mind, I am ashamed of myself again and again. I don't need another pointed finger, I don't want to hide, just find myself. I come to you filthy. Take a bite of the sickness and feel the rush. Save me, save me, save me, because I can't save myself.</segment2>
		<segment3>I HATE RELIGION, I DON'T NEED A CULT!. The world doesn't need any more fakes.</segment3>
		<segment4>I have committed cosmic plagiarism, I was a self proclaimed god, a mirror image of a cheap imitation. Those we thought were on top, quickly fall to the bottom when judgment drops. In death shame fills the black and immortal soul. We were never meant to save ourselves.</segment4>
		<segment5>I HATE RELIGION, I DON'T NEED A CULT!. The world doesn't need any more fakes.</segment5>
		<segment6>So I walk a new path, no one chooses for me.. So I walk a new path, no one chooses for me. So I walk a new path, no one chooses for me.    </segment6>
