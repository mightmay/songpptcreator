		<segment1>Pain is a forest we all get lost in. Between the branches hope can be so hard to see. And In the darkness, weve all got questions. Were all just trying to make sense out of suffering, but </segment1>
		<segment2>You say I am blessed because of this. So, I choose to believe. As I carry this cross. Youll carry me (Help me believe it)</segment2>
		<segment3>Fear is a current we all get caught in. And in its motion faith can be so hard to find. And we all falter, cause were all broken. Were all just trying to turn the shadows into light, but </segment3>
		<segment4>You get glory in the midst of this. And Youre walking with me, and </segment4>
		<segment5>I know Your promises are faithful. And God, Ive seen Your goodness in my life. And oh, Ive found Your mercy is a river. Your love is an ocean wide</segment5>
		<segment6>You carry me God. You carry me    </segment6>
