		<segment1>Bury all the differences between us. When I still can't find the air, You keep the toxins flowing for me, And I'll bury all the differences between us. And I still can't help but care for moving mountains, But your, your head's held high again. </segment1>
		<segment2>You will find me out. You will find everything. </segment2>
		<segment3>We all, we just battle ourselves. We just battle ourselves again. </segment3>
		<segment4>Bury all the differences between us, that same mechanic sound. That keeps on ringing for days and days. And you're standing like a clueless titan falls. And everything around falls right down on you. With your head held high again. </segment4>
		<segment5>You will find me out. You will find everything. </segment5>
		<segment6>We all, we just battle ourselves. We just battle ourselves again. </segment6>
		<segment7>And there's a storm cloud waiting over, On the land that's sinking at the, At the bottom of these buildings again. With your head held high again. </segment7>
		<segment8>You will find me out. You will find everything. </segment8>
		<segment9>We all, we just battle ourselves. We just battle ourselves again.     </segment9>
