		<segment1>Big business ain't easy. I'm sure you'd agree. Especially when the product is eternity-. To stay one step ahead we must achieve. And turn this holy temple. Into a factory. Is there anywhere you can run. To hide from these thieves? -. Cause eternity's on sale today for a fee</segment1>
		<segment2>Faith is buying me away. Buying me a way. To convert the masses into little servants. Faith is buying me away. Buying me a way. Buying me into your home (soul)</segment2>
		<segment3>Our sanctuary of this high-rise. Our steeples our billboards. Our slogans our converts. Oh don't forget to buy this T-shirt. As you leave. And open up the offering box. And give until it hurts. Show me an open heart and we'll steal it away. Cause eternity's on up for sale for a small fee today. You Know</segment3>
		<segment4>This altar is a stage. Our sponsor must be paid. And maybe even make the front page    </segment4>
