		<segment1>You have never changed your ways. You think that you can own me like a slave. And I want to walk away. But every time I try you're in my face. You say, I could have it all. Trust you, you will never let me fall. And my heart feels bound to your control. But my spirit says, no, no, no</segment1>
		<segment2>Stop right there. Suddenly temptation's flying. Everywhere. And you think you've got me down. Well think again, I'm not your friend. It's plain to see, I'm not your property. Stop right there. Suddenly temptation's flying. Everywhere. And you think you've got me down. Well think again, I'm not your friend. Don't play with me, I'm not your property</segment2>
		<segment3>Ring! Brrlp! It's you once again. Begging me to listen to your plan. But you see I've found the truth. 'Cause I have been redeemed and so we're through. You say, I could have it all. Trust you, you will never let me fall. I don't have to give into your demands. The power's not in your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't have to do anything you want me to. I don't need you to make me feel like I want more. 'Cause God has shown His love is your weakness. He is above and beyond all you can do</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS (twice)    </segment6>
