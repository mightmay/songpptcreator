		<segment1>Jesus loves me this I know. For the Bible tells me so. All of us to Him belong. We are so weak, but our God, He is strong</segment1>
		<segment2>As I sit and ponder I begin to wonder why. God would send His only son upon this earth to die. The conviction of my heart brings a tear to my eye. And keep reality far from me, I just want to hide. Christ endured such cruelty for a sinner like me. He paid the price when He died for me on Calvary's tree. I once was blind, but now my eyes clearly see. The sacrifice Christ became for you and me. Because Jesus loves me, this I know. For the Word of God tells me so. All of us to Him belong, it's true. That we are weak, yet He is strong</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. Yes, Jesus loves me. For the Bible tells me so</segment3>
		<segment4>He will stand by like no other man. Two sets of footprints within the sand. But at times looking back one is all I see. These are the days that He carried me. He has proven His love time and again. Pulled me from the fire, a result of my sin. Compare where I am now to where I might have been. Get on my knees just to praise Him again and again. Thank you for loving me, it's undeserved. It doesn't make sense, I mean the picture is blurred. I'm the one that owes the debt, but you paid my price. Now Jesus Christ, I owe you my life</segment4>
		<segment5>(repeat chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Now that I can see it, will the life I lead change. It's kinda strange we make decisions. When they're out of our range. But in day to day living, we tend to give up. On commitments that were made before life got tough. With compromise in our eyes and pressure from peers. We renig on a decision that we once held so dear. But let's try keep sight of this vision foreseen. Hold tight day and night beyond the point of a dream. Because Jesus loves me, this I know. For the Word of God it tells me so. Everyone of us to Him belong, it's true. We are so weak, yet He is so strong</segment6>
		<segment7>(repeat chorus).     </segment7>
