		<segment1>Things are moving sideways, they are tracing every step. It starts a circle, it starts connection. Not waiting for a net, jumping reckless, set still surveillance some switch, turned on</segment1>
		<segment2>Through back doors, back doors, through back doors</segment2>
		<segment3>I thought it was as it seems. But everyone is alone</segment3>
		<segment4>Streetlights in the distance shed light on gravity. As the traffic moves to the clothes he's seen. Where the spilling of secrets on the floor. Cause to question deep in our hearts</segment4>
		<segment5>I can hear it calling out to disappear again    </segment5>
