		<segment1>My thoughts they overwhelm me. My mind cannot contain. The pain that is within me. Why. I long for understanding. I live to know the peace. that comes from being sure of something. My eyes are blind to your ways oh Lord. Yet I've seen you love and care, so</segment1>
		<segment2>I rest in your knowing. Though I may not know. I take on your strength as though it were my own. Standing on the promises your word for me provides. I find therein the answer. To the question Why..</segment2>
		<segment3>My complaint today is bitter. But sweet is your reply. My questioning still lingers though why. You know each road I travel down. My heart and Yours are one. But I just don't see the good in all this. My eyes are blind to your ways oh Lord. yet I've seen you love and care so..</segment3>
		<segment4>I rest in your knowing. Though I may not know. I take on your strength as though it were my own. Standing on the promises your word for me provides. I find therein the answer. To the question Why..</segment4>
		<segment5>Through suffering and sorrow. Comes peace beyond belief. For our present set of circumstances. Serve only to remind us of the gold we can't yet see    </segment5>
