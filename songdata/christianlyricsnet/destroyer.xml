		<segment1>Ready yourself for the end. Ready yourself cause you cannot pretend. Ready yourself for the late, for the great. The DestroyerÂ’s surrounded and cannot defend</segment1>
		<segment2>The lives that you thought that were yours to devour. Destroyer, the tables have turned in this hour. The plagues you unleashed, every vice that you fed. Shall be visited here tenfold on your head</segment2>
		<segment3>Let go. Cause you know. In the end all you were was a pawn in the show</segment3>
		<segment4>Witness the fear of the fiends. Open the floodgates, behold and believe. Witness the pain, let it rain on the beast. For the serpent is slain in a blaze of defeat    </segment4>
