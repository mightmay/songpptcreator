		<segment1>we don't have to say a word. sometimes its better when we don't. apologizes aren't always heard </segment1>
		<segment2>sit beside me through the storm. the clouds above will take another form </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. it would be so easy for you to walk away. all that I can tell you is. I want you to stay </segment3>
		<segment4>forget that man I was before. my eyes are open to the sky. my back lay flat against another shore </segment4>
		<segment5>I can't erase mistakes I've made. and I can't stand to have them bring you pain </segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>the clouds are empty. they roll away. the sky is silent. I am amazed. that you are still sitting here. when you could have left me. to drift away </segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
