		<segment1>The mountain tops are not as tall. The valleys seem to be getting small. Still the river rolls deep inside me. Take the dreams that didn't grow. And visions that melted in the snow. Take away my laugh. Still I'll climb the pathway home</segment1>
		<segment2>With my hand in your hand. My life in your life. My spirit will rise. Until I see the rainbow    </segment2>
