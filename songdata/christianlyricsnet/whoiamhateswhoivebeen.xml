		<segment1>I watched the proverbial sunrise. Coming up over the pacific. And you might think I'm losing my mind. But I will shy away from the specifics. Cause I don't want you to know where I am. Cause then you'll see my heart in the saddest state it's ever been. And this is no place to try and live my life</segment1>
		<segment2>Stop right there. That's exactly where I lost it. See that line. Well I never should've crossed it. Stop right there. Well I never should've said that. It's the very moment that I wish that I could take back</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm sorry for the person I became. I'm sorry that it took so long for me to change. I'm ready to be sure I never become that way again. Cause who I am hates who I've been. Who I am hates who I've been</segment3>
		<segment4>I talked to absolutely no one. Couldn't keep to myself enough. And the things bottled inside had finally begun. To create so much pressure that I'd soon blow up</segment4>
		<segment5>And I heard the reverberating footsteps. Syncing up to the beating of my heart. And I was positive that unless I got myself together. I would watch me fall apart</segment5>
		<segment6>And I can't let that happen again. Cause then you'll see my heart in the saddest state it's ever been. And this is no place to try and live my life</segment6>
		<segment7>Who I am hates who I've been. And who I am will take the second chance you gave me. Who I am hates who I've been. Cause who I've been only ever made me    </segment7>
