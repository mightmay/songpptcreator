		<segment1>You don't need to have it all. You don't even need a lot. You don't need to be a doctor. A judge or astronaut. You don't need to be a hero. You don't need a lot of cash. You don't need a fancy car. You don't need to be a smash. You need someone you can count on. Someone you can trust. Someone who is loving. And your life you would entrust </segment1>
		<segment2>It's not who you are. It's who you know. It's not where you've been. It's where you'll go. It's not how you look. It's how you see. It's not what you want. It's what you need. What you need is a friend </segment2>
		<segment3>A victim or a villain. Your life has been a mess. Your past is full of sorrow. You've had nothing but distress. It don't matter if you're poor. It don't matter if you're weak. It don't matter if the years. Have been hard on your physique. There's someon you can go to. Who can save you from your sins. Jesus is your friend. No matter where you've been </segment3>
