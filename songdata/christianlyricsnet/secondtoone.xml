		<segment1>There's a me that I don't really like. A me that says I'm. In control til the day that I die. And I dont know why. I push I pull I fight I fall. I end up crawling back to. That place where I figure it out. That I, that I, that I</segment1>
		<segment2>I'M SECOND TO ONE. REDEEMER, THE WAY, THE LIGHT. I'M SECOND TO ONE. THE SAVIOR. NO COMPROMISE. I'M LAYING EVERYTHING. AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS	. MY PRIDE, MY LIFE, MY ALL. I AM SECOND TO ONE. AND HE IS SECOND TO NONE</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a change when I swallow my pride. And I surrender. There's a peace when I open my eyes. Cuz I remember. To live's to die. To fall's to rise. To kneel's to find the Savior. Here I am and I've figured it out. Tonight tonight tonight..</segment3>
		<segment4>He said &quot;You come alive. When you lose your life&quot;. so I lay it down. Yeah I surrender all    </segment4>
