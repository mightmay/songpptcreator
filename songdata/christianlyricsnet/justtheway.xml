		<segment1>This one right here. This is to let everybody know. That you gotta know who you are. And you gotta know whose you are. Hey, I know whose I am. By the way</segment1>
		<segment2>Baby boy wait a second hear me out. You don't know what you're talking about. Don't know me or how I roll. Child of the king your flossin don't appeal to me. I'm not impressed with shopping sprees. Man your game ain't worth my soul</segment2>
		<segment3>(Hey boy) I know what you're looking for and it's ain't your night. (Hey boy) you've got your eyes on me, but I've got my eyes on high. (Hey boy) don't you know the difference is in the life I've found. (Hey boy) took one chance it turned my life around</segment3>
		<segment4>It's just the way he loves me. It's just the way he talks to me. It's just the way he moves me. It's just the way he sets me free</segment4>
		<segment5>It's just the way he loves me. It's just the way he talks to me. It's just the way he moves me. It's just the way he sets me free</segment5>
		<segment6>Baby girl I see it from a mile away. You're lost and you can't find your way. Trying to find just who you are. You need to know. You're worth more than your weight in gold. But gotta let God take control. Truly be a shining star</segment6>
		<segment7>(Hey girl) I know what you're looking for you're not looking right. (Hey girl) you've got your eyes on everything but on the most high. (Hey girl) hear me when I say the difference is in the life I've found. (Hey girl) take one chance he'll turn your life around</segment7>
		<segment8>It's just the way he loves me. It's just the way he talks to me. It's just the way he moves me. It's just the way he sets me free</segment8>
		<segment9>It's just the way he loves me. It's just the way he talks to me. It's just the way he moves me. It's just the way he sets me free</segment9>
		<segment10>I've never been so happy (repeat)     </segment10>
