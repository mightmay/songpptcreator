		<segment1>The Jordan is waiting for me to cross through. My heart is aging I can tell. So Lord, I'm begging. For one last favor from You. Here's my heart take it where You will</segment1>
		<segment2>This life has shown me how we're mended. And how we're torn. How it's okay to be lonely as long as you're free. Sometimes my ground was stoney. And sometimes covered up with thorns. And only You could make it what it had to be. And now that it's done. Well, if they dressed me like a pauper. Or if they dined me like a prince. If they lay me with my fathers. Or if my ashes scatter on the wind. I don't care</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: But when I leave I want to go out like Elijah. With a whirlwind to fuel my chariot of fire. And when I look back on the stars. Well, It'll be like a candlelight in Central Park. And it won't break my heart to say goodbye</segment3>
		<segment4>There's people been friendly. But they'd never be your friends. Sometimes this has bent me to the ground. Now that this is all ending. I want to hear some music once again. 'Cause it's the finest thing I have ever found</segment4>
		<segment5>But the Jordan is waiting. Though I ain't never seen the other side. They say you can't take in. The things you have here. So on the road to salvation. I stick out my thumb and He gives me a ride. And His music is already falling on my ears</segment5>
		<segment6>There's people been talking. They say they're worried about my soul. Well, I'm here to tell you I'll keep rocking. 'Til I'm sure it's my time to roll. And when I do</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS(2x)    </segment7>
