		<segment1>I'm losing hold of today's and clinging to forever's. Waiting for your hands that reach the sky to hold me once again. Could you tell me?. How is it that you bring the heavens to this empty room?. There is not one thing about you that fails to amaze me. I have wasted so much time. Patient for more empty words and hoping for love in their eyes. All for nothing but let downs and apologies sweet apologies</segment1>
		<segment2>I pray you see my heart here now. It's burning more desperate. than these longs letters could ever read or show. These let downs always come. I know them better then anyone. YouÂ¹ll be there for me. I know you'll see me through. This way I see it seems so new to me    </segment2>
