		<segment1>When all is said and done. And I'm looking back upon the race I've run. And when my heart gives in. I know you will be beside me precious friend. It's just the same from the beginning to the end. When all is said and done.</segment1>
		<segment2>If I lose my way. And I wander down this open road for days. And if the sun should fall. And the dancing we once did becomes a crawl. Let the memories move like shadows on the wall. If I lose my way.</segment2>
		<segment3>When I'm coming home. And I walk across the bridge of death alone. I will fix my eyes. On the One who's waiting at the other side. My old friend with countless others there beside. When I'm coming home    </segment3>
