		<segment1>I got two things to tell you 'bout my girl. Two things to tell you 'bout my girl. One, leave her alone. Two, leave her alone. 'Cause if you don't. We'll be looking for your bones. And I might be stuck in a cell. But you'll be burning in hell</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: 'Cause I'm jealous man refined. Jealous plans and mine. Jealous man that brings me down. Jealous man</segment2>
		<segment3>And I got two to tell you things to tell about this bar. Two things to tell you about these bars. One, they leave me alone. Two, you'd like to go home</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Ah J Nash</segment5>
		<segment6>I got two things to tell you about this rope. Two things to tell you about this rope. One, it's gonna help me cope. Two, ain't got no more hope. So I'm forming a noose. 'Cause I got to cut lose</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>When the guard opened the door. My feet weren't touching the floor. And I ain't jealous no more. Cut me down bury me. 'Cause I'm jealous    </segment8>
