		<segment1>Father I will not worry about tomorrow or all of its questions. Father I will just trust you. And I will be waiting for treasures in heaven. My heart is with you for there my treasure lies. My eyes are on you for you are my delight</segment1>

		<segment3>Though I may not wear the garments of princes. You are my portion you are my portion. For you clothe me in your righteousness. You are my portion you are my portion. Though I may not sit at the table of kings. You are my portion you are my portion. For you feed me from the abundance of your hand. You are my portion you are my portion Lord</segment3>
