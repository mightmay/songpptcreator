		<segment1>All Im thinking about. Is keeping your hope alive. You say youre better alone. But tears wont let you hide. The feeling that I know so well. A place Ive been before. Locked behind the pain inside. Screaming for a door. Your tears wont let you hide. Your tears wont let you hide. Youre running to a breakthrough. Theres nowhere else to go. Youre reaching for the sunshine. The sunshine. All the lines are on the move. The colors start to fight. True love clears the view. Revealing the black and white. Confusion now is history. And all the fear is gone. You left behind the pain inside. Screaming for more. Youre reaching for the sunshine. The sunshine takes you home.     </segment1>
