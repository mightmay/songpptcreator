		<segment1>Your laughter it echoes like a joyous thunder. Your whisper it warms me like a summer breeze. Your anger is fiercer than the sun in its splendour. Youre close and yet full of mystery. Ever since the day that I saw Your face. Try as I may, I cannot look away, I cannot look away </segment1>
		<segment2>Captivated by You. I am captivated by You. May my life be one unbroken gaze. Fixed upon the beauty of Your face </segment2>
		<segment3>Beholding is becoming, so as You fill my gaze. I become more like You and my heart is changed. Beholding is becoming, so as You fill my view. Transform me into the likeness of You </segment3>
		<segment4>This is what I ask, for all my days. That I may, never look away, never look away. No other could ever be as beautiful. No other could ever steal my heart away. I just cant look away    </segment4>
