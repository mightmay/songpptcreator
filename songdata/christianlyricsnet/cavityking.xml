		<segment1>Desires in conquest to. Murder her maim her. Progress possession in blackmail entrails to. Pursuit your end for. Regret with shame no end to shade. Bait her in comfort complete. Then move to kill. Red ink. Spills from her veins. Your quill still draws her in. Red ink. Spills from her veins. In curses, in cursive </segment1>
		<segment2>This is regret in it's purest. A simple plan here. Your on the trail of the. Hunted, haunted now. Smiling and nodding. She'll go without a fight (without a fight). To your delight. She's unaware. Unaware. She's helpless in your sights </segment2>
		<segment3>Encounters. Though brief. Murdering heaping. The coals, the heat. Surgery pending. You're. The king. Of cavity quenching by. Inching. The tips. Of fingers across the. Forbidden. Forbidden. Forbidden </segment3>
		<segment4>I know. You ache. But she is alive. I know. You ache. But she's more than a story </segment4>
		<segment5>Your entries made public. Your journals in crimson. Her veins filled with red ink. Your quill spills in crimson.     </segment5>
