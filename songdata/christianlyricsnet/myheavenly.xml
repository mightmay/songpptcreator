		<segment1>let the wind fall wild across my path. even though we barely move, there's no turning back. there is a river; there is a road. place of holy riches untold. it's where i'm s'pposed to be. where i'm s'pposed to be. my heavenly, mmm-mmm</segment1>
		<segment2>i know it never feels right. to let go of the safety we're used to holding so tight. but there is a lion underneath these skies. though love cries (though love cries). though love cries, love will rise. my, my, my heavenly</segment2>
		<segment3>so fly me higher, higher. hope fill me, keep me here. love lion, my, my..</segment3>
		<segment4>so when i'm lonely or when i'm old. life is more behind me. all the stories have been told. i can fix my gaze up through the clouds. where i'm gonna be. where i'm gonna be. my heavenly</segment4>
		<segment5>my, my heavenly. my heavenly    </segment5>
