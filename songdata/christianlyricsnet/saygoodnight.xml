		<segment1>I never thought it'd come so soon. I'd be with you inside this room. Heaven's taking you from me. Your hand grows weak, it's telling me it's time to leave</segment1>
		<segment2>Help me say goodnight. I won't say goodbye. Leave the light on, I'll be home in time</segment2>
		<segment3>How can a granite. stone symbolize. The kaleidoscope. that was your life?. Your words will stay alive in me. My knees grow weak, the tears I leave, are healing me    </segment3>
