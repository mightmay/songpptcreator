		<segment1>Counting every moment. Biding all my time. Standing out here on my own. Searching for that someone. To heal this heart of mine. And keep me from being alone. But when will it be. And how will I know. I don't want to wait here forever</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Somebody love me. Come and carry me away. Somebody need me. To be the blue in their grey. Somebody want me. The way I've always dreamed it could be. Won't somebody love me, love me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm waiting for somebody. To dance across the floor. Sweeping me off of my feet. I'm looking for the right one. To open up that door. And offer me a tender retreat. It's like wanting to sing. But needing a song. When will I hear the music playing</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)    </segment4>
