		<segment1>This hollow feeling, The knowledge that you exist. Amidst your insecurities. Cover up only to coward out, And never shutting up. Only to never speak aloud. Have you dried up entirely?</segment1>
		<segment2>The walls of a church don't make it holy. It's what's authentic that completes the sum of it's parts. Don't excuse yourself from today on the pretense of your past.</segment2>
		<segment3>You're hurt. You're broken. That's alright. This might be what it takes to wake you up..</segment3>
		<segment4>Are you at your wits end yet? [4x]</segment4>
		<segment5>The walls of a church don't make it holy. Security isn't glitzy or glamorous, concrete or cohesive. Therein lies the truth. Lift your head up high..</segment5>
		<segment6>It's what we know we aren't, that makes us who we are. [2x]</segment6>
		<segment7>You're hurt. You're broken. That's alright. That makes us who we are (who we are). You're hurt. You're broken. That's alright. That makes us who we are.    </segment7>
