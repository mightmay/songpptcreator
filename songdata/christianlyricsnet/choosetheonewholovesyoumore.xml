		<segment1>rain rain rain on my mind. i've got a secret life. wipe wipe wipe it away. nothing can make me dry. fight all the while. fight till i think i'm free. feel rains we'll never see. beautiful secret lives</segment1>
		<segment2>it can make you, face all your fears</segment2>
		<segment3>oh smile smile in the day. fear takes its place at night. oh oh be in the rain. i love your secret life</segment3>
		<segment4>it can make you, face all your fears</segment4>
		<segment5>i could leave you well enough. alone believe and you'll be overcome. and gone by grace away. better off than if i stay. i could leave you walk away. we'll save it for another day. through all the wars have come to know. it's best to know that time was grown in</segment5>
		<segment6>i think i'm knocking on your hearts door. choose the one who loves you more, oh. and when you find something to die for. (it can make you face all your fears). they'll be knocking on your hears door    </segment6>
