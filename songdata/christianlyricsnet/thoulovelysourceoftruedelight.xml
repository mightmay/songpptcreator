		<segment1>Thou lovely source of true delight whom I unseen adore. Unveil Thy beauties to my sight that I might love Thee more. Oh that I might love Thee more</segment1>
		<segment2>Thy glory o'er creation shines yet in Thy sacred word. I read in fairer brighter lines my bleeding, dying Lord. Oh my bleeding, dying Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>'Tis here whene'er my comforts droop and sin and sorrows rise. Thy love with cheering beams of hope my fainting heart supplies. My fainting heart's supplied</segment3>
		<segment4>And ah too soon the pleasing scene is clouded over with pain. My gloomy fears rise dark between and I again complain. Oh and I again complain</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus my Lord, my life, my light, oh come with blissful ray. Break radiant through the shades of night and chase my fears away. Won't you chase my fears away</segment5>
		<segment6>Then shall my soul with rapture trace the wonders of Thy love. But the full glories of Thy face are only known above. They are only known above</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh come let us adore. My bleeding dying Lord    </segment7>
