		<segment1>Verse 1: Built like a tower, Stood about 6 foot 4, Known to be the meanest man. In town. (and nobody could). Really get next to him, 'least nobody could before, (but that was long before). Before the power of love came down. </segment1>
		<segment2>It happened one cold night. At the birth of his new baby, Holding him so tight, That man was weeping like a child, To the power. </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: (It's the power of love). Make a grown man show his weakness, Bowing to the power of love. (It's the power of love). Make the coldest heart a believer, Believer in the power of love. (It's the power of love) </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: She's a lonely widow. Livin' in her mansion all alone. And no one ever saw her. Come or go. (but every Friday night). She would slip unnoticed to the. Mission down the road. 'cause that's where all the. Hungry people go. </segment4>
		<segment5>Spent all her time, Tears and money, Just to help them through the pain. She was frail, but ain' it funny, She was 8 feet tall with the. Power of love. </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus:.. </segment6>
		<segment7>It's an amazing mystery. It can put you on your feet. Or drive you to your knees.    </segment7>
