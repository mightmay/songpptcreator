		<segment1>Oh my God, I can't believe. In the way we strive, this urgency.</segment1>
		<segment2>When I see we can make it, we'll make it. We can make it, we'll make it.</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Are we wastin' too much time. Are we wastin' too much time.</segment3>
		<segment4>Never stop, for fear of silence. Can't connect, we're all willing victims</segment4>
		<segment5>When I see we can make it, we'll make it. We can make it, we'll make it.     </segment5>
