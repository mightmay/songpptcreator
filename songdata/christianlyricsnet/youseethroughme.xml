		<segment1>I dont know the time of day. That you could come to rearrange my everything. It only takes a second with you. To overturn what Ive been going through</segment1>
		<segment2>You know all about me. All there is to know about. Even the darkest parts that I hide. I cant pull the wool over your eyes. You see straight through me, all the way through me</segment2>
		<segment3>Everything I hide is shown. When youre around to expose my everything. It only takes a second with you. To overturn what Ive been going through</segment3>
		<segment4>. Everything is in your hands. Nothing is out of your control. You alone are high and lifted up. You alone. Are high and lifted up </segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
