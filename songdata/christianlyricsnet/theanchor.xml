		<segment1>All I've held on here. Is the anchor of my fear. All I'm looking for. Is strength to let this go</segment1>
		<segment2>All my hopes and dreams. I lay before you here. All I've failed and feared. They cease to reappear</segment2>
		<segment3>And all of this noise fades around me. In stillness and silence You're here. Now Your perfect love surrounds me. The chains I've known disappear</segment3>
		<segment4>Now the hope that I hold to. Is the anchor of my soul. And the peace that I can see. Is Your promise haunting me</segment4>
		<segment5>And all of this noise fades around me. In stillness and silence You're here. And now Your perfect love it surrounds me. The all the chains I have known disappear</segment5>
		<segment6>You're the anchor of my soul. By Your perfect love I know. Sin has no grip on me. By Your priceless blood I'm free. Oh I am free. Ohh, Ohh    </segment6>
