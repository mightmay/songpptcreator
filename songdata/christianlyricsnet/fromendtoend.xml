		<segment3>hey hey, can you hear anything i say. i'm feeling unwanted, that's not what i wanted. and attention to me is something you refuse to pay</segment3>
		<segment4>cause i just can't believe the way that this. continues to go on. i say i wish you didn't always think i'm wrong. so tell me. tell me what will it take to get this through your head. and tell me what will it take. until you see things through from end to end</segment4>
