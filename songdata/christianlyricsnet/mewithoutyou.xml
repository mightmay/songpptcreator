		<segment1>Like a band without a drummer. That's me without You. Like a year without a summer. That's me without You. Like a king without a country. Like a room without a view. Like an empty gun. Like a fatherless son. That's me without You</segment1>
		<segment2>Like a ship without a rudder. That's me without You. Like a child without it's mother. That's me without You. Like a story with no ending. Like a foot without a shoe. Like a wasted feast. Like faithless priest. That's me without You</segment2>
		<segment3>Me without You. A pitiful sight. Me without You. It ain't never gonna feel right</segment3>
		<segment4>Like a war without an enemy. That's me without You. A disease without a remedy. That's me without You. Like a crime without a victim. Like a sleuth without a clue. Like an empty gun. Like a fatherless sun. That's me without You</segment4>
		<segment5>Me without You. A pitiful sight. Me without You. It ain't never gonna feel right</segment5>
		<segment6>Without You. Without You    </segment6>
