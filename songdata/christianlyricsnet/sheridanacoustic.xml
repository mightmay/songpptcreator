		<segment1>It's hard to understand. When you don't know me. But we can still be friends. It's better of that way</segment1>
		<segment2>Through my eyes I'll see you there. I'll never be the same again. With my words I'll make a change. And I'll never be the same again</segment2>
		<segment3>It's hard to make amends. I know it isn't easy. But try and understand. It's really not that bad</segment3>
		<segment4>Through my eyes I'll see you there. I'm hard to understand when no one ever seems to care. And with my words I'll make a change. And try to rearrange </segment4>
		<segment5>Walls of fear come crashing down. I won't look back don't turn around. And with my life I'll make a change. Hope we'll all be friends again.     </segment5>
