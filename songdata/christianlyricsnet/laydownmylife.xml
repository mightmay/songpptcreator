		<segment1>All your pain. Will be made mine. All your troubles. The tears you cry</segment1>

		<segment3>Father, give me strength. I know there is no other way</segment3>
		<segment4>I lay down my life for you. This is the moment when all will be made new. I know that you dont understand. But this is part of a greater plan. So I lay down my life for you</segment4>
		<segment5>This is love. That had to bleed. To bring you mercy. To set you free</segment5>
		<segment6>You are mine. I am yours. And I will wear your burdens. Just like this crown of thorns</segment6>
		<segment7>I will take your place. I know there is no other way</segment7>
		<segment8>I lay down my life for you. This is the moment when all will be made new. I know that you dont understand. But this is part of a greater plan. So I lay down my life for you</segment8>
		<segment9>Give me all your pride. Give me all your fears. Give me all your secrets. Give me all your tears</segment9>
		<segment10>Give me all you doubt. Give me all your shame. Watch them wash away. Watch them wash away</segment10>
		<segment11>Give me all your pride. Give me all your fears. Give me all your secrets. Give me all your tears</segment11>
		<segment12>Give me all you doubt. Give me all your shame. Watch them wash away. In Jesus name</segment12>
		<segment13>I lay down my life for you. This is the moment when all will be made new. I know that you dont understand. But this is part of a greater plan. So I lay down my life for you</segment13>
		<segment14>Though I know that you dont understand. These scars are part of a greater plan. And I lay down my life for you</segment14>
		<segment15>Arms stretched out. Upon this tree. To show true love. To set you free    </segment15>
