		<segment1>Your face is beautiful. And Your eyes are like the stars. Your gentle hands have healing. There inside the scars. Your loving arms they draw me near. And Your smile it brings me peace. Draw me closer oh my Lord. Draw me closer Lord to Thee </segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Captivate us, Lord Jesus. Set our eyes on You. Devastate us with Your presence. Falling down. And rushing river, draw us nearer. Holy fountain consume us with You. Captivate us Lord Jesus, with You </segment2>
		<segment3>Your voice is powerful. And Your words are radiant bright. In Your breath and shadow. I will come close and abide. You whisper love and life divine. And Your fellowship is free. Draw me closer O my Lord. Draw me closer Lord to Thee </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>Let everything be lost in the shadows. Of the light of Your face. Let every chain be broken from me. As Im bound in Your grace. For Your yoke is easy, Your burden is light. Youre full of wisdom, power and might. And every eye will see You </segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus).     </segment6>
