		<segment1>You would think that I could find a. simple song, a photograph of mine. To show this public eye, what I have to offer. I may not have a PHD, or speak in eloquent philosophy!. I'm nothing more than simply me you see!</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS(*1): What I am trying to say. I'm just a babe in so many ways!</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm still growing, still stretchin. Still breaking in these new shoes. Looking for a way to make a mark of my own. I'm just a spring chick, wet behind the ears. It's a part of life so there's no need to fear. These growing pains that I'm going through</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't regret, I'm not ashamed that I. haven't yet begun to speaketh ways.. (As the wisest of men), oh perhaps some day. But for now I'm grateful to be a part of. the family tree, while The Man upstairs does His work on me. It's a job that may take eternity to complete</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS(*2): Just when I've learned all I can, those growing. Pains up and kick on in again!</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>BRIDGE: Time after time, one more time and again, will it ever end?. It's the lessons in our lives that make us wise. But young or old I am told its the same. Oh, these growing pains never go away, so I'll just keep on trying</segment7>
		<segment8>Music break</segment8>
		<segment9>CHORUS(*1)</segment9>
		<segment10>CHORUS</segment10>
		<segment11>Oh, baby dont worry about a thang!    </segment11>
