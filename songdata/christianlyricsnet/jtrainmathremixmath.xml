		<segment1>(feat. Kirk Franklin) </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. I got a ticket, I got a ticket. I got a ticket to ride. (Gotta a ticket to ride to the other side). I got a ticket, I got a ticket. I got a ticket to ride. (Gotta ticket to ride to the other side) </segment2>
		<segment3>Ride ride wanna ride on the J Train. On the J Train wanna ride on the J Train. Ride ride wanna ride on the J Train. On the J Train wanna ride on the J Train </segment3>
		<segment4>Sit back, relax put on your travelin' gear. No need to doubt so put aside your fear. &quot;Destination&quot; out of this atmosphere. It's the J Train baby, we depart from right here. No lines to fight no ticket to price. I'm rollin' first class 'cause I've seen the light. Try as you may but your money can't buy. A ticket on the J Line to the other side </segment4>
		<segment5>[CHORUS] </segment5>
		<segment6>Now I missed the Train more than once in my life. Til' the good conductor heard my Momma's cry. Hades to Glory in the blink of an eye. Hear me now, hear me now while I testify. Heard the whistle blow I felt a chill to the bone. &quot;All aboard&quot; is what I heard I was headed for home. Had a reclinable seat but I just had to stand. Up on the &quot;J&quot; all the way to the promise land </segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS] </segment7>
		<segment8>Do you wanna ride say. To the other side say. If you wanna ride say. Get on the Freak Line</segment8>
