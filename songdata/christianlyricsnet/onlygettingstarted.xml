		<segment1>I was just a little kid when. I heard about you for the first time. And all I really, really knew for sure. Is you were God I wanted to know you. And now the years have come and gone. Im still singing that same song. You might think by now I would have reached the end. But the truth is</segment1>
		<segment2>I am only just beginning. I am only getting. Started to know you now. Im only getting started. And when I start thinking Im getting. Close to the end, you just smile at me and say. Hey kid, you aint seen nothing yet. Im only getting started. Im only getting started now</segment2>
		<segment3>Now your love it is an ocean. Deeper than my deepest notion. Your grace it is the sky above. It just keeps going forever. And with every new sunrise. You come and open up my eyes. And show me just a little more of you. And again I see that</segment3>
		<segment4>I am only just beginning. I am only getting. Started to know you now. Im only getting started. And when I start thinking Im getting. Close to the end, you just smile at me and say. Hey kid, you aint seen nothing yet. Im only getting started</segment4>
		<segment5>I am only just beginning. I am only getting. Started to know you now. Im only getting started. And when I start thinking Im getting. Close to the end, you just smile at me and say. Hey kid, you aint seen nothing yet. Im only getting started. Im only getting started now</segment5>
		<segment6>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Starting to know you now. Getting started. And when I start thinking Im getting. Close to the end, you just smile at me and say </segment6>
