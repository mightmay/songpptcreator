		<segment1>May the grace that sought my heart on that first day. Be the grace that binds my heart to stay. May the truth that opened up my eyes on that first time. Be the thoughts on my mind that never go away</segment1>
		<segment2>For You are a lamp to my feet. A light to my path. You're the hand that's holding me</segment2>
		<segment3>Faithful God, every promise kept. Every need You've met, Faithful God. All I am and all I'll ever be. Is all because You love faithfully. Faithful God</segment3>
		<segment4>May the love that caught my heart to set it free. Be the love that others see in me. And may this hope that's reaches to the depths of human need. Be the song that I sing in joy and suffering</segment4>
		<segment5>For you are the love that never leaves. The friend that won't deceive. You're the one sure thing</segment5>
		<segment6>Faithful God, every promise kept. Every need You've met, Faithful God. All I am and all I'll ever be. Is all because You love faithfully. Faithful God</segment6>
		<segment7>How deep, how wide the love. That pierced His side, the love. Redemption's mine, O Love that will not let me go</segment7>
		<segment8>How deep the love (How deep, how wide the love). How deep the love (That pierced His side, the love). Redemption's mine, O Love that will not let me go</segment8>
		<segment9>How deep, how wide the love. That pierced His side, the love. Redemption's mine, O Love that will not let me go</segment9>
		<segment10>Faithful God, every promise kept. Every need You've met, Faithful God. All I am and all I'll ever be. Is all because You love faithfully. Faithful God    </segment10>
