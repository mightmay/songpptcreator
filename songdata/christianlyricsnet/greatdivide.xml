		<segment1>Shut down, fall asleep. the more you hold the less you keep. untied your concern. the stronger the grip the more you'll burn</segment1>
		<segment2>board up the west side. it feels like it's coming round. batten down the east side. it feels like it's coming, feels like it's coming down to this day</segment2>
		<segment3>don't speak, breathe in deep. he's so sycophantic I can't understand it. hold fast, this won't last. his long-suffering is what takes timing. find your great divide. you might hesitate but I don't recommend it</segment3>
		<segment4>look up, blinders on. overcomplicated like the boy you are. shake this simple fist. all you need is some excuse to blame it on    </segment4>
