		<segment1>Verse I. I don't know where I wanna go with this but I know somehow it'll mean somethin. I hope to tell you how I feel through this song, and I need to apologize what I did was wrong. I'm hoping in all your glory you'll forgive me. If it's not asking to much to be saved. I believe in you three times a day I pray. My life is in your hands but to my dismay</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I've sinned my Lord. Come take me higher. I've sinned my Lord. That is my desire. I've sinned my Lord. But I've changed my priorities. Jesus take me please</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse II. Last night I brought out my bible. Because I knew I was lost. So I got down to my knees and started praying. Lord please help me see. The wrong in what I've been doing. Guide me so my mediocrity may become decency, help me be all that I can be.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus x2</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Only you can take me higher. In my eyes you can see the fire. I sacrifice my mind body and soul. And now I know that I am not alone. Lord may she rest in peace and all the rest of you lookin down on me. Help me now I'm on the rocks. On behalf of myself I'm praying. BECAUSE</segment5>
