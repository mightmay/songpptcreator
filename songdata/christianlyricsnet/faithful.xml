		<segment1>I've come to love You Lord, I've come to bring all my praise. I've come to honour You, And to glorify Your beautiful Name.</segment1>
		<segment2>Your favour is surrounding me. Your word is lighting my way. You're faithful to deliver me, Your glorious love leads the way to salvation.</segment2>
		<segment3>All heaven and earth will worship You. Singing holy is the Lord. A hymn of pure adoration, as we see Your wonderful Kingdom come. Your favour is surrounding me, Your word is lighting my way. You're faithful to deliver me, Your glorious love leads the way to salvation.    </segment3>
