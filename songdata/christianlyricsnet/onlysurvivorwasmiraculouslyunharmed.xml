		<segment1>Someone has sown me shut. And tied me to a bed. They locked me up. Oh, God!. This is where they all. Throw me to the wolves. Dragged behind and trampled on. I cant keep clawing at the jaws of hell. The silence is killing me. Nothing to calm the nerve. Write down my thoughts. And read me my rights. Repeat, repeat, repent and repeat. The cycle never really ends. Till they admit that its real. Everything is leaving me wondering. I hate that Im questioning. Youre everything. This is how it seems to me. Ive drowned myself in self-regret. This is how I wanna be. This cant be how I wanna be. They just spin in perfect little circles. And thats all they know. Nothings right, just left alone. Sinking in will be just fine. None of them will ever know.     </segment1>
