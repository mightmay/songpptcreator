		<segment1>Your love is extravagent. Your friendship intimate. I find I'm moving. To the rhythms of Your grace. Your fragrance is intoxicating. In our secret place. Your love is extravagant</segment1>
		<segment2>Spread wide in the arms of Christ. Is the love that covers sin. No greater love have I ever known. You considered me a friend. Capture my heart again. Capture my heart again</segment2>
		<segment3>Deeper than the deepest ocean. Your love is. Higher than the highest mountain. Reaches higher than the Heavens. Still it finds its way to me. Finds its way to me</segment3>
		<segment4>Your love is extravagant. Your love is extravagant. Your love is extravagant    </segment4>
