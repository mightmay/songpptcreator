		<segment1>give love one to another. give love one to each other. and we'll be fine. we'll be fine </segment1>
		<segment2>i feel alone, i feel so cold, when i'm apart from you for just one night. you keep me alive. feeling fine. when i've got something as good as you inside. </segment2>
		<segment3>got nothing to lost been hanging in twos. but i need something to get me through this. nothing to lose been hanging in twos. but i need you to get me through this </segment3>
		<segment4>there's no better time. than when i find You in a feeling. and know i'm doing alright. Nothing to hide, just to confide. when i've got something as good as You inside </segment4>
		<segment5>what the world needs now. is a little know how. to turn itself right upside down    </segment5>
