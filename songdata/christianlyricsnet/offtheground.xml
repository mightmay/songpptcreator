		<segment1>You see me up and down. Yeah I've been around. But you never changed a bit. No you never backed down. You've been my strength to change. From my worst days. And still I fool myself with fear and doubt. But now I'm swept off my feet. I feel so complete. So content in the now. And I won't let it go. Cause you know I know. That you don't let me down. No you don't let me down</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: You bring me higher / Off the ground. Your gravity pulls me / Off the ground. Deep from the garden / Where we were found</segment2>
		<segment3>I've seen the darkest nights. Forced my eyes to bleed. I've lived without a light. Battled lies and greed. You've taught me how to fight. Life's tempting ways. And still I fall from flight. But you're here. And now I'm swept off my feet. I feel so complete. All is perfect right now. And I won't let it go. Cause you know I know. That you don't let us down. No you don't let us down</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Off the ground x2</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS x2</segment6>
		<segment7>When you found us there / Off the ground    </segment7>
