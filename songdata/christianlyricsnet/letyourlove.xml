		<segment1>Track Number:  12</segment1>
		<segment2>. In this world of news, I've found nothing new. I've found nothing pure. Maybe I'm just idealistic to assume that truth. Could be fact and form. That love could be a verb. Maybe I'm just a little misinformed</segment2>
		<segment3>As the dead moon rises, and the freeways sigh. Let the trains watch over the tides and the mist. Spinning circles in our sky's tonight. Let the trucks roll in from Los Angeles. Maybe our stars are unanimously tired</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). Let your love be strong, and I don't care what goes down. Let your love be strong enough to weather through the thunder cloud. Fury and thunder clap like stealing the fire from your eyes. All of my world hanging on your love</segment4>
		<segment5>Let the wars begin, let my strength wear thin. Let my fingers crack, let my world fall apart. Train the monkeys on my back to fight. Let it start tonight. When my world explodes, when my stars touch the ground. Falling down like broken satellites</segment5>
		<segment6>. (chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>All of my world resting on your love </segment7>
		<segment8>.     </segment8>
