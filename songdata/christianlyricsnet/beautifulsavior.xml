		<segment1>All my days I will sing the song of gladness. Give my praise to the fountain of delights. For in my helplessness, you hear my cry. And waves of mercy poured down on my life </segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Beautiful Savior, wonderful counselor. Clothed in majesty, Lord of history. You're the way, the truth and the life. Star of the morning, glorious in holiness. You're the risen one, heaven's champion. And you reign, you reign over all </segment2>
		<segment3>I will trust in the cross of my Redeemer. I will sing of the LAMB that never fails. Of sins forgiven, of conscience cleared. Of death defeated and life without end </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). Beautiful, beautiful Savior. Wonderful counselor, beautiful risen one </segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus). I long to be where the praise is never ending. Yearn to DWELL where the glory never fades. WITH countless worshippers SINGING one song. And the voices of the nations. Sing worthy, worthy, worthy. Worthy beautiful, beautiful one. Jesus you are worthy, beautiful, beautiful one. Jesus you're worthy, beautiful, beautiful one. You are worthy, beautiful, risen one    </segment5>
