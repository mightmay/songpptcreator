		<segment1>Martyr! I saw the dead before the throne. Martyr! I saw the dead before the throne. Martyr! The ending is better than the beginning. What has been given will outlast forever. Nothing added nothing taken away. In this time when injustice seems to prevail. We are without failure. So what do you fear? ItÂ’s going to get harder and harder. I scream Martyr! in the house of mourning. I scream Martyr! in the house of mourning. (The) temporaries fleeting with eternity in our hearts. Our song will always remain. With all authority. The ending is better than the beginning. What has been given will outlast forever. May these words never diminish with short term memories. But may the echoes resonate eternity. Manifested through me. So what do you fear? I scream Martyr! in the house of mourning. Our song will always remain. With all authority. With all authority.    </segment1>
