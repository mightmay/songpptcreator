		<segment1>Chorus: </segment1>
		<segment2>I believe that this world believes in love (x 2) </segment2>
		<segment3>We might never really agree. On anything about the lives we live. Between you and me. So differently. </segment3>
		<segment4>We dont always see things the same. We should agree to disagree. If we meet at love we can work it out </segment4>
		<segment5>chorus: I believe you and I will overcome. I believe you and I believe in love </segment5>
		<segment6>Whether you think Im so confused. Or if you feel the way I do. So dont give in to this hate within </segment6>
		<segment7>Living in this world of pain. Dont let it bring you down. The world is a ghetto </segment7>
