		<segment1>I didn't know then what I know now. That you could take a life and turn it around. Then keep it stayed on solid ground. Until you did it all for me. See Lord, I knew that my life was going down. Until you came in and rescued me</segment1>
		<segment2>You said to keep my mind stayed on thee. And you'd supply my every need. But Lord, there's so much you've already done for me. You made me see you're all that I need. So here's a praise from my heart. Thanks for blessing me. I'm on my knees. Thanking you for keeping me</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Wanna thank you Lord, for all you've done for me. My life is complete and I give you all the praise. I wish I knew then what I know now. What the good life is all about. It took so long for me to figure out. But I'm so glad that I did</segment3>
		<segment4>It took a while for me to see. I needed you to make my life complete. Erase my past and then direct me. And make me what I need to be. But Lord, there's so much you've already done for me. You make me see you're all that I need. So here's a praise from my heart. Thanks for blessing me. I'm on my knees. Thanking you for keeping me</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus    </segment5>
