		<segment1>Soft memories of a life well lived. I'm thinking back and loving every moment I had. This dull feeling is working through me, and every waking moment is more static. As I step onto my porch of reflection, a brief wind of warmth is swept through me. We succeed in order to bring forth order in our lives. You have all felt it - the emptiness of being alone. Zoloft will not cure it, human touch will not solve it. This black, cold world is potent. Please bless the children, please heal their cries. A sweet sound is heard in my waking life. Tremors of anguish ripple through visions and dreams. Cries heal a starving nation facing death and destruction.    </segment1>
