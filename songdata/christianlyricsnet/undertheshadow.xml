		<segment1>He who dwelleth in the secret place. Of the most high shall abide. Under the shadow. Under the shadow. Of the Almighty </segment1>
		<segment2>Though a thousand. Fall before me. From the evil. That's around me </segment2>
		<segment3>They shall not. They shall not come nigh my dwelling </segment3>
		<segment4>And I will say of the Lord He is my refuge and my fortress. My God in Him will I trust. And I will not be afraid of the snare of the fowler. My God in Him will I trust    </segment4>
