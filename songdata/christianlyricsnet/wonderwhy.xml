		<segment1>You know for certain that you are a liar. You told me yourself you know the Truth. But you won't put two and two together. You know the sum would expose you</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). And you wonder why you feel this way. And you wonder how long it will take to heal. And you wonder what you did to get here. And you wonder who will save you from you</segment2>
		<segment3>You've tried everything that has been in your reach. But none of it seems to satisfy. So like a man lost at sea. Your thirst leads you to drink the water. The more you drink, the more your throat runs dry. And you wonder why</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus 2x).     </segment4>
