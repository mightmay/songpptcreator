		<segment1>Gather around to hear the future. Wonder what or who it will be. Rumors fly of the possibilities, everyone is taking a chance.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I know, when everythings said and done, in the end, nothing they say will matter anyway.</segment2>
		<segment3>Well always be just who we are. Well be okay no matter where we land.</segment3>
		<segment4>Time to take the stage. Turn my eyes up towards the sky. The room is very dark, but somehow theres light in here.</segment4>
		<segment5>And I know, when everythings said and done, in the end, nothing they say will matter anyway.</segment5>
		<segment6>Well always be just who we are. Well be okay no matter where we land. (x 2)</segment6>
		<segment7>So here we are. Better put on The happy face, Open up the curtains, Show the final word what they want, what they want..</segment7>
		<segment8>Well always be just who we are. Well be okay no matter where we land. (x 2)    </segment8>
