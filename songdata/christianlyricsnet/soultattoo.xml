		<segment1>I just know that I've never felt like this. And I know it's because. You exist in my life. Like hope shining bright. Through the stormy skies</segment1>
		<segment2>And that's why I could. Never turn away from You. I'd be some kind of fool. To think I could lose your love. You know that's. Something I can't do</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: 'Cause You're the answer. To the questions. The reason to the rhyme. You're the rhythm to my heart. When it beats out of time. I'm so thankful, Lord. That You are mine. It's true that You. Are my soul tattoo</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, You know. All that I want to do. Is to spend my life loving You. It's Your love time and again. That pulls me through. And I want to say thank you</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Etched on my soul. Your love is so true. Always in my heart. In Your arms forever</segment6>
		<segment7>Etched on my soul. Your love is so true. Stamped forever. Here in my soul</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
