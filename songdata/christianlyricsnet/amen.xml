		<segment1>My body breaks beneath the weight. Of toil and trouble, fears and fights. Sickness in me, world against me. I cry to You tonight</segment1>
		<segment2>Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. Holy Healer. Strength within. Pass me not. Forsake me not, Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>Amen </segment3>
		<segment4>My enemies are whispering. They pray my name may die. So few to trust, so few are just. I cry to You tonight</segment4>
		<segment5> </segment5>
		<segment6>Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. Faithful Brother. Closest Friend. Pass me not</segment6>
		<segment7>Forsake me not, Lord. Amen, Amen</segment7>
		<segment8>My heart is dim, It's always been. I turn from what is right. Passions of youth tear me from truth. I cry to You tonight</segment8>
		<segment9> </segment9>
		<segment10>Christ have mercy. Lord have mercy. Sinless Savior. Judge of men. Pass me not. Forsake me not, Lord. Amen, Amen     </segment10>
