		<segment1>flying high with the crowd at night. we float on unseen fuel. each one sails, a gossamer sphere. our course unwinds like thread from a spool</segment1>
		<segment2>what's it like inside the bubble?. say the souls who'd like to try. cut your tether; come and join me. we can swim across the sky</segment2>
		<segment3>look at me with a childlike eye. and understand who's bound. why are those who are on the ground. afraid of falling down?</segment3>
		<segment4>love has killed our fear. and when we're done we'll disappear</segment4>
		<segment5>draws you out inside the ring. comes a holy breath of truth. setting free and sealing you. in eternal youth.    </segment5>
