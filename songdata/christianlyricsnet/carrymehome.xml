		<segment1>Lord bring me home again. I'm no longer able. To bear the bitter winds. Or the heavy rains. I've long been settled. Lord without comfort. Just a man on an earthly throne headed for the grave</segment1>
		<segment2>Carry me home. Sweet Jesus lift me. Until I've flown. The shadow of shame. Your love alone. Lord Jesus mends me. Lift me up. Oh Lord carry me home</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord I've been branded. A loyal sinner. Seems like forever. Since I said Your name. I'm just a pilgrim. Still afraid of dying. But the sea is shining brightly. With Your grace</segment3>
		<segment4>Carry me home. Sweet Jesus lift me. Until I've flown. The shadow of shame. Your love alone. Lord Jesus mends me. Lift me up. Oh Lord carry me home</segment4>
		<segment5>Carry me home. Sweet Jesus lift me. Until I've flown. The shadow of shame. Your love alone. Lord Jesus mends me. Lift me up. Oh Lord carry me home</segment5>
		<segment6>Carry me home. Sweet Jesus lift me. Until I've flown. The shadow of shame. Your love alone. Lord Jesus mends me. Lift me up. Oh Lord carry me home</segment6>
		<segment7>Lift me up. Oh Lord carry me home     </segment7>
