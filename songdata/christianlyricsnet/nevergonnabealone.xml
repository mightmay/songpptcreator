		<segment1>You may think that this song is a little trite. You may be right. You may think that I'm foolish and I. Have a simple mind. But I say we're all the same. We all want the same things out of life</segment1>
		<segment2>We all wanna be loved, we all wanna belong. We all wanna know it's gonna be alright</segment2>
		<segment3>That's why Jesus came. And gave His life away. And rose again on the that day. So we could say</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). I'm ne ne never gonna be alone. 'Cause He's around. I'm ne ne never gonna be alone. Alone 'cause He's around. I'm ne ne never gonna be alone. 'Cause He's around. I'm ne ne never gonna be alone. Alone 'cause He's around</segment4>
		<segment5>I know that this life is short. You're up and born and then you're off. You're sitting in class staring at the walls. Walking down the halls and goofing off. Then before you think there's time to blink. You're got a job and you're on your own. Then you get a wife, you get a life. And you wish that you could just move back home</segment5>
		<segment6>That's why Jesus said. Live every day to its best. And along the way don't forget. He'll take care of the rest. So..</segment6>
		<segment7>(chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>All around, all around, all around me. In everything I see. Right beside, far ahead, just behind me. He'll always be</segment8>
		<segment9>(chorus)    </segment9>
