		<segment1>Ooh my little city was pretty tough. When it was the kingdom called Babylona. Ooh, I made a golden god and told the mob. Got to come and bow before my persona. Everybody dropped, givin' up. Such a pretty sight, they all were givin' up. All the town, 'cept three Israelites. Why, why, why, why, why?! Whoa!. Ba-ba-ba-babylona. Called the little jokers up -- said &quot;Bring 'em up. Close enough to look in my fire's aroma!. Hebrew children, listen to me, you're dissin' me. Come and bow or simmer like Rice-a-rona!&quot;. &quot;Never gonna drop,&quot; they said &quot;We're not. &quot;Such important guys, but God will get us out!&quot;. Told the guards, &quot;Throw them in the fire!&quot;. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye! Whoa!. Ba-ba-ba-babylona. Ba-ba-ba-babylona. Said to throw them into the rotisserie. Sizzlin' like a platter of fried bologna. Kids youre just a recipe, so rest in peace!. They didnt burst in flames and die. Why? Dont knowa. Never would have thought they'd live at all. Such a burnin' fire. I saw them with their God. Called them out. Now they're friends of mine. My, my, my, my, my! Whoa!. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bye bye bye bye bye bye! Whoa!. Ba-ba-ba-babylona. Ba-ba-ba-babylona. Ba-ba-ba-babylona. Ba-ba-ba-babylona. Hot (hot), hot (hot), Ouch. Hot, (hot), hot (hot), Ouch. Hot. Too hot in the hot tub. Ow!. Oooo, (aaah). Babylona!. Oooo, (aaah). Babylona!. Oooo, aaah. Babylona!</segment1>
