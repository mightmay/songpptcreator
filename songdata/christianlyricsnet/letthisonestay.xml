		<segment1>Outside of all your subtlety. Upside down while you're straight with me. And I deny that this is your way. Can I, can I still find my way? </segment1>
		<segment2>Please let this one stay. To help me find your way (your way). Please let this one stay. To help me find your way (your way). As I'm drowning, Engulfing the saltwater air. She begs me to find you, I acknowledge you there </segment2>
		<segment3>Cure my cancer with your answer    </segment3>
