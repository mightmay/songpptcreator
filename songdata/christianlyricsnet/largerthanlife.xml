		<segment1>Walk this life beneath the stars. Contemplate just who we are. Against the backdrop of knowing God</segment1>
		<segment2>Seasons pass, they come and go. But one thing keeps its worth in gold. A timeless bond, sharing dreams we hold</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS</segment3>
		<segment4>It's larger than life, it's larger than we. It's bigger than you, it's bigger than me. It's larger than life</segment4>
		<segment5>There's something here that tells me so. I was not made to walk alone. It sharpens me to know we stand as one</segment5>
		<segment6>Will our lives reflect the Maker. Of the sky we're living under. It changes all to know You're really there. When the space between us falls apart. You're the bridge that spans our hearts</segment6>
		<segment7>You're larger than life, You're larger than we. Who's bigger than You? You're bigger than me. Larger than life    </segment7>
