		<segment1>I never was a big hearted man, Not the loving kind. Id never give in to anyone, Never foil my pride. (but Im telling you). I wound up alone. With no friends, no love, no one. But You changed my heart and my attitude. You made me a better man. And I owe it all to You. . CHORUS: Take my heart, take my soul. Take me anywhere You want me to go. I wanna walk on the road You choose. So Ill follow You. Change my mind, change it now. Turn my whole world upside down. I got a new kind of love, and You. Got me mind, body, heart and soul. . I used to cling to this life of mine. Used to hold on tight. Until You opened my blinded eyes. And I saw Your light. You said there was more, so much. More to be livin for. I found Your love. And I found the truth. I found my life again. When I gave it all to You. . Chorus. . Theres been a change in my life. And You are the reason why. I found Your love. And I found the truth. I found my life again. And I gave it all to You    </segment1>
