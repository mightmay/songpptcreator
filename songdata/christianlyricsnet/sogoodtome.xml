		<segment1>O God You've been so good to me. You came and found this orphan. And You brought me right into. Your family O God. You've been so good to me. You threw away my past. And You never count my sins against me </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: </segment2>
		<segment3>You got me dancing. And now I'm shouting. You go me leaping. And now I'm spinning Hallelujah </segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE: </segment4>
		<segment5>You're so good to me Nah nah nah nah. You're so good to me Nah nah nah nah. You're so good to me O God. You've been so good to me. And every day I wake up. I breath another breath of. Your mercy O God. You've been so good to me. And my delight is in. You 'Cause I know that. Your hand is upon me Chorus Jesus. You're the one Who saved myself from me. So I will be the one. To praise You in the streets Bridge    </segment5>
