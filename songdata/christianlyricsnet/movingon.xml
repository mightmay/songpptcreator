		<segment1>It has gotten to my head. Permeates the path I tread. But I tread, I'm moving on. In a new happy song. I can sig about the night. How my tunnel without light. Led me to the other side. Where the sky is blue</segment1>
		<segment2>It's all I can do to not let them ruin me. I will not let them ruin me. I will not let them ruin me again</segment2>
		<segment3>There is fire inside the tree. Flames of knowing kissing me. I have waited long to see a sign from you</segment3>
		<segment4>It's all I can do to not let them ruin me. I will not let them ruin me. I will not let them ruin me again    </segment4>
