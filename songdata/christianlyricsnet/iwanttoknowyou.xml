		<segment1>In the secret. In the quiet place. In the stillness. You are there. In the secret. In the quiet hour I wait only for You. Cause, I want to know You more</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I want to know You. I want to hear Your voice. I want to know You more. I want to touch You. I want to see Your face. I want to know You more</segment2>
		<segment3>I am reaching for the highest goal. That I might receive the prize. Pressing onward. Pushing every hindrance aside. Out of my way. Cause, I want to know You more.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus (4x)    </segment4>
