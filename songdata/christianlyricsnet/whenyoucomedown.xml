		<segment1>All of me longs for You, Light of the world. Coming soon, breaking through all this pain. Falling down, calling out, Your love surrounding me.</segment1>
		<segment2>For you I will wait, In you I will wait.</segment2>
		<segment3>I will look to the day when you're coming again. To heal the hearts of men - when you come down. Let us look to the sky with redemption in our eyes. Watch the world come alive - when You come down    </segment3>
