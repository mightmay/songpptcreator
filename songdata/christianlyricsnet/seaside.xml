		<segment1>Walking on the seaside. With a sunset over blue. Hand in hand with you</segment1>
		<segment2>Listen to the waves break. On a blanket spread for two. Hand in hand with you</segment2>
		<segment3>If I had a million sand dollars. IÂ’d spend them all on you. And build a sandcastle. Just big enough for two</segment3>
		<segment4>So look me in the eyes, dear. And know my love is true. Hand in hand with you    </segment4>
