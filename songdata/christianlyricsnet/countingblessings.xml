		<segment1>It must have been miraculous, Paul was jailed, But how come his smile wasn't snuffed out?. He talked with the churches. In his letters, He would preach, We have many blessings, So fill your thoughts with good. He said: Focus all your thoughts on God. It tells me in Philippians 4. I must admit it's tough to do. All our days there's stuff that's bringin' us down. Think about only good thoughts, Skip the bad, And you'll see, We have many blessings, So fill your thoughts with good. He said: Focus all your thoughts on God. It'll make your life much easier. And thank Him that you got this far. Focus all your thoughts on God 'cause the devil's a deceiver;. He'll tell you life is very hard. It's not very hard now. When getting low, Lift up the praise. All our moods, They are choices we must make. Our souls are saved. We are family, God's own people, And have many blessings, So fill your thoughts with good.     </segment1>
