		<segment1>How much is too much?. How much can one take. Till a soul finally breaks?</segment1>
		<segment2>How far is too far?. When nothing looks right. No end to the night..</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold on love. It's all on the line. But you'll be alright. Lift up your head. You must be strong. Must sing out your song</segment3>
		<segment4>How wrong is too wrong?. Till you feel so mislead. Into a world of regret</segment4>
		<segment5>How long is too long?. To trade the truth for a lie. Until there's no where to hide</segment5>
		<segment6>Hold on love. It's all on the line. But you'll be alright. Lift up your head. You must be strong. Must sing out your song</segment6>
		<segment7>Dropping defenses. Those rough bloody edges. That open the gate of the hate that en-cages. Hello to new life. Means hello to goodbye. Welcome the change rearranging the inside</segment7>
		<segment8>Hold on love. It's all on the line. But you'll be alright. Lift up your head. You must be strong. Must sing out your song</segment8>
		<segment9>Hold on love. It's all on the line. But you'll be alright. Lift up your head. You must be strong. Must sing out your song.     </segment9>
