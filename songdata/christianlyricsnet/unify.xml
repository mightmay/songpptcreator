		<segment1>You reached out and rescued me.. answer to my dreams. and love hung on a cross so we could meet..</segment1>
		<segment2>calmed my restlesness.. words fail to express.. there's no where I would rather be than with you.</segment2>
		<segment3>the whole earth fall on it's knees.. at the sound of your beautiful name. and all the voices in teh world unify today. to bring you this song of praise.</segment3>
		<segment4>I call on you my king.. you open your arms to me. and embrace me like a father to a child    </segment4>
