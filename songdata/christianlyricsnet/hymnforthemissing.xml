		<segment1>Tried to walk together. But the night was growing dark. Thought you were beside me. But i reached and you were gone. Sometimes I hear you calling from some lost and distant shore. I hear you crying softly for the way it was before</segment1>
		<segment2>Where are you now?. Are you lost?. Will I find you again?. Are you alone?. Are you afraid?. Are you searching for me?. Why did you go?. I had to stay. Now I'm reaching for you. Will you wait?. Will you wait?. Will I see you again?</segment2>
		<segment3>You took it with you when you left. These scars are just a trace. Now it wanders lost and wounded. This heart that I misplaced    </segment3>
