		<segment1>Look at your face, it doesn't shine the way it used to. Look at your eyes, they don't sparkle anymore. Look what you've done, you've ruined it for everyone. Who told you that you had to lose your innocence</segment1>
		<segment2>(I can begin). I, I'm starting over. (Again). I, I'm starting over</segment2>
		<segment3>Now tell me how, I get back to my childhood. I used to think it was so naive, I was so naive</segment3>
		<segment4>Look what I've done. I've ruined it for everyone. I should have held on harder to my innocence</segment4>
		<segment5>It's never too late. It's never too late for starting over</segment5>
		<segment6>Reclaim your innocence, start over. Reclaim your innocence, reclaim you innocence. Start over, start over</segment6>
		<segment7>Look at your face, it doesn't shine the way it used to.     </segment7>
