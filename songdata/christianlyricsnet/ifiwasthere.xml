		<segment1>I close my eyes and think about Calvary. I see it happening right in front of me. the back that bore the whip, the head that held the crown of thorns. what if I was there. would I even care, would I even care. or would I only stare</segment1>
		<segment2>What if I was there just a face in the crowd. would I hide in shame or would I laugh out loud. would I pity Him or think that He is just a fool. another criminal. or just the truth, or just the truth. He is heaven's jewel</segment2>
		<segment3>As He marched up that hill. I can picture Him still in my mind. all the blood and the sweat on His brow. as He passed me on by, I could see in His eyes. that His pain was a gift of His love</segment3>
		<segment4>He was the sacrifice-the Lamb. and He is the great I AM. and He paid the price for me. the price for you and me-you and me</segment4>
		<segment5>He made the deaf to hear again. He called the sinful man a friend. He walked that hill for me. so my blind soul could see-could see</segment5>
		<segment6>As He marched up that hill. I can picture Him still in my mind. all the blood and the sweat on His brow. as He passed me on by, I could see in His eyes. that His pain was a gift of His love</segment6>
		<segment7>I close my eyes and think about Calvary. I see it happening right in front of me. two criminals were there-with one on either side of Him. one hurled insults and one believed-and one believed. which one am I?     </segment7>
