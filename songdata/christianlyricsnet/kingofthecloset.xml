		<segment1>I answer with a restless ok but I'm about to blow when you're gone. I keep this to myself; a restless ok but I fear the dawn. I've never been afraid to hide up in the dark. It's the first morning stream of pure light that makes me rather swim with the sharks. And it'll make me say I'm ok even though it hurts more if I stay. And I'm ok. Yes, I'm ok. If that'll make your questions go away</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm a vampire, I'm afraid the light will set me on fire</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm cold in a way I just want to stay. And I'm cold this way</segment3>
		<segment4>Reckon I'll close the door. Pull down the curtains stay close to the floor. Mercy is for the weak; we do not train to be merciful here. Mercy is everything I fear; we do not train to see His mercy here</segment4>
		<segment5>Crawling again. The heart is screaming with a smile. Pride says no because of the stain. The heart pounds for love, pride says no. Because of what the heart is longing for. I'm not sure I want to be a man anymore</segment5>
		<segment6>This choice I've got to make, I've got to make alone. A heart of stone. This choice I've got to make. I've got to make it true. A heart broken in two    </segment6>
