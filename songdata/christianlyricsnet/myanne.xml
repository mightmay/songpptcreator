		<segment1>Darling I want to make the word &quot;love&quot; new. cause it's been said so many times. And I don't want to use that old pick up line. And oft' I try to find the words to use but none capture the way I feel. When I gaze at your smile it seems like I'm out flying a sunset skyline. You've stolen my eyes, I stare at what I can't describe. I guess I tried</segment1>
		<segment2>Look in my eyes. It's not hard to realize I'm the one who loves you. And though you'll never know my heart, my complete feelings. Just know you'll never be alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Words keep cluttering in my mind as I persist in this futility. But no vocabulary could ever represent the beauty I see. You're everything and more than I could want you to be. And in your face what do I see?</segment3>
		<segment4>It's like a rainbow in my mind, like when the daylight starts to die</segment4>
		<segment5>Just like a landscape catching rain. or like a snow glazed mountain face. Like Charlie Chaplain, like clapping one hand, my love can not be heard. And all those love songs, they come out all wrong. cause there's just no such word, my Annie</segment5>
		<segment6>Look in my eyes. It's not hard to realize I'm the one who loves you. And though you'll never know my heart, my full emotion. Just know you'll never be alone, my Annie    </segment6>
