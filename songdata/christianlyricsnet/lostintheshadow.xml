		<segment1>I wake to the sound of different voices calling my name. Two little ones who want to start another day. And one voice that's calling. Take up your cross and come follow Me</segment1>
		<segment2>And I want to get lost. In the shadow of the cross. To answer the all surrender it all. in the shadow. I want to live this (each) day. With a humble heart. that's ready to pay. Whatever it costs to find myself lost. In the shadow of the cross</segment2>
		<segment3>Living beneath the burden of this cross I carry. I'm finding more of Christ and losing more of me. So I'll hide in His shadow. Until I am nothing and He is everything</segment3>
		<segment4>And I want to get lost. In the shadow of the cross. To answer the all surrender it all. in the shadow. I want to live this (each) day. With a humble heart. that's ready to pay. Whatever it costs to find myself lost. In the shadow of the cross</segment4>
		<segment5>The voices that call to me like my little ones are sleeping. But here in the shadow there's one whisper I still hear</segment5>
		<segment6>And I want to get lost. In the shadow of the cross. To answer the all surrender it all. in the shadow. I want to live this (each) day. With a humble heart. that's ready to pay. Whatever it costs to find myself lost. In the shadow of the cross </segment6>
