		<segment1>Behold our god is gracious. He's moving among the nations. Preparing a bride for jesus. And proving he reigns. His spirit is tearing down walls. Built on the pride of men. To those who've rejected him. He's reaching his hand out again</segment1>
		<segment2>We will embrace. We will embrace your move. We will embrace. We will embrace your love. We will embrace. We will embrace your move. We will embrace. We will embrace your love</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh god be our god and we'll be. Your people of praise. We'll dance and we'll sing for our. God is the ancient of days</segment3>
		<segment4>Our god is preparing a feast. The spirit and bride say come. Calling out to the least and. Filling our lamp stands with oil. And he is restoring his people. By rains of sweet renewal. And the music of heaven. Will soon overtake the earth    </segment4>
