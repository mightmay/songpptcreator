		<segment1>Through the raging gates of hell / He has shown redemption. He has opened up the skies / And made up for my losses. Who can make dark the purpose of Yahweh?. Who can take away the hand of compassion?</segment1>
		<segment2>The air is blessed and my house is full. I was destroyed but Your hand brought beauty. My sin had overcome me but Your hand brought mercy. I am lifted by her love / Through the cracks of my despair. Each day is made new in Your hands forever</segment2>
		<segment3>This is a call to the weak / These are the words we proclaim. Piece by piece I have gained a part of myself. My dreams are one again / Let me take you. Beauty  Your majesty / Love forgives travesty</segment3>
		<segment4>This is a call to the weak / These are the words we proclaim. Piece by piece I have gained a part of myself. My dreams are one again / Let me take you. Beauty  Your majesty / Love forgives travesty. Love forgives / Love forgives / Love forgives    </segment4>
