		<segment1>The blazing sunrise, the endless oceans. The spinning planets all reveal their Makers power. They shout His glory, they shine His beauty. Their voices cry an invitation to us all. They are summoning every soul, Summoning every soul </segment1>
		<segment2>This is a call to worship. Let it echo all around the earth. This is a call to bow down. And give God the glory He deserves </segment2>
		<segment3>We have gathered, to praise our Maker. Weve come to worship him for we have heard the call. Let every nation and all creation. Join us worshipping the holy God of all. As we cry out to all of this world. Cry out to all of this world </segment3>
		<segment4>To the north and the south. Let this invitation resonate. To the east and the west. Let this invitation resonate. Till the north and the south. Till the east and the west. Overflow with praise    </segment4>
