		<segment1>It's hard to fit in, When you're on the outside, Feels like someone's getting to my head, Was it somethin' I did, or just somethin' I said?. I'm not an idiot, but I feel like one a lot, 'Cause every time I try I end up here, Right where I started, just feelin' unguarded</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't care if it comes out perfect, As long as I can spit it out</segment2>
		<segment3>Then He said. Take your time, take what you need to, Peace of mind, should never leave you, You'll be fine, just let them see you, On The Inside. Hurt takes time, don't be afraid of, What you got, show them what ya made of, You will find, it's gonna be alright. So let's go! </segment3>
		<segment4>It's hard to get up, When you don't feel like movin', It's hard to lift your head up, Sometimes, 'cause it feels like it's lastin', But it's gonna pass. I'm not an alien, But I feel like one a lot, 'Cause every time I try, I end up here, Just floatin' in space, With that look on my face</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't care if it comes out perfect, As long as I can spit it out</segment5>
		<segment6>Then He said. Take your time, take what you need to, Peace of mind, should never leave you, You'll be fine, just let them see you, On The Inside. Hurt takes time, don't be afraid of, What you got, show them what ya made of, You will find, it's gonna be alright. So let's go!    </segment6>
