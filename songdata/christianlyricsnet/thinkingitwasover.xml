		<segment1>I've been thinking it over, taking the time to find the words. Getting closer to this God I serve. Because He came over and God became a man, coming in colors in black and white and red. I've been thinking it over and over. Barely breathing, seeing, believing God in love come from above. And I've been thinking it over. Hallelujah, that God would make a man. Hallelujah, and save him with His hand. I've been thinking it over. Barely breathing, seeing, believing God in love come from above. And I've been thinking it over. So could I come over and bow before Your feet, sit and wonder how I have been received?. I've been thinking it  over.     </segment1>
