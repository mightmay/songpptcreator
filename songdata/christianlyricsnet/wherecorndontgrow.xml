		<segment1>As we sat on the front porch. Of that old grey house where I was born and raised. Starin' at the dusty fields. Where my daddy worked hard every day. I think it kinda hurt him when I said Daddy. There's a lot that I don't know. But don't you ever dream about a life. Where corn don't grow</segment1>
		<segment2>He just sat there silent. Staring at his favorite coffee cup. I saw a storm of mixed emotion in his eyes. When he looked up. He said Son I know at your age. Seems like this ol' world is turning slow. And you think you'll find the answer to it all. Where corn don't grow</segment2>
		<segment3>Hard times are real. There's dusty fields. No matter where you go. You may change your mind. 'Cause the weeds are high. Where corn don't grow</segment3>
		<segment4>I remember feeling guilty. When Daddy turned and walked back in the house. I was only seventeen back then. But I thought that I knew more than I know now. I can't say he didn't warn me. This city life's a hard row to hoe. Ain't it funny how a dream can turn around. Where corn don't grow</segment4>
		<segment5>Hard times are real. There's dusty fields. No matter where you go. And you may change your mind. 'Cause the weeds are high. Where corn don't grow</segment5>
		<segment6>You may change your mind. Oh the weeds are high. Where corn don't grow    </segment6>
