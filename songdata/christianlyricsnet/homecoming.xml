		<segment1>In two, alone he'll forget the time. Burn money to ashes, be drunken with wine. A fool, not knowing his left from right. He's losing direction his home within sight. (Staggered in with nowhere to begin)</segment1>
		<segment2>I've left you again now I'm back to amend. No word that I say will be true. I'm fine on my own except for I'm all alone. I'm just incomplete without you</segment2>
		<segment3>Undo the bondage of faith that ties. Unsevered connections just holding too tight. End pretending thoughts stop sending surface his new home. Won't think to long he's incomplete without you. (Staring over the shoulder to sin)</segment3>
		<segment4>I've left you again now I'm back to amend. No word that I say will be true. I'm fine on my own except for I'm all alone. I'm just incomplete without you</segment4>
		<segment5>Away he's walking to the sun. Blinded in light of what he's done. And echoed voices burning. He's trying hard to clear his mind. But digging deeper he'll only find. Buried treasure forgotten face</segment5>
		<segment6>Here I am on my own now coming home. I'm fine on my own except for I'm all alone. I'm just incomplete without you    </segment6>
