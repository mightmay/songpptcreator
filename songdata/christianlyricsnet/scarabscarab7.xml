		<segment1>Twisted purity bent for our desires from the tongue to greed to blood a bloodpath of hypocrisy innocent lives drowning in a sea of sin drawn deep from within our nature to mold and make contaminate light of this world taken only for its shell will leave this world a living hell too much religion torn by man's hand will you leave the spirit scorned or take a stand it's time for the truth that's in my heart.     </segment1>
