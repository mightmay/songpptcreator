		<segment1>you took me over the edge. and left me there to fall by myself. the word love meant nothing to you. i was taken in with your lies. and you knew i was too weak to leave. but you were wrong. you mean nothing to me now. every time you think of me. i hope your heart dies. i have found my true love. and you now burn beneath my feet. you'll pay for everything you've done. if you could die. i'd be the one with the gun. from this day on. i'll write the songs you hate. and pray the prayers that drive you away. it's time to let the world know how. you tried to ruin my life. up burn my thoughts of him. the virus leaves me.     </segment1>
