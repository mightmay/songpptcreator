		<segment1>There's a boy that I once knew. He lived his life in pain. Everyone thought he had it all, But no one knows the truth. Anger and hate so deep inside, Waiting for their chance.. a boy with no control looking down at a cold steel chamber. Mercy at last. Darkness comes on so strong. His world gets painted black. The frail boy collapsed. The fight is done. Just one thing left to do;. One technicality. Face to face with death;. There's finally someone who cares. Darkness comes on so strong. His world gets painted black. The frail boy collapsed. The fight is done.    </segment1>
