		<segment1>Sick with regret you sputter out. Your flame swallowed in doubt. Light the cigarette and take a breath, the smoke inflates your chest and thins your blood. so you bleed less inside. Left with the mess that came about. when you chose to live without out. on foreign shores you fight or die. life's thrown before your eyes and leaves it's toll. on your calloused empty soul</segment1>
		<segment2>How long, how long will we be desperately alone, how long, how long?. How long, how long will we have to pay for what we've done, how long, how long?</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;What we would give to feel alive!&quot;. Through the fog a muffled cry, &quot;The anchor's lost and so am I,&quot;. We fall victims to the tide. I'm free to drift and free to die on my terms now</segment3>
		<segment4>How long, how long will we be desperately alone, how long, how long?. How long, how long will we have to pay for what we've done, how long, how long?</segment4>
		<segment5>Sick with regret you sputter out    </segment5>
