		<segment1>Open up and reveal what's goin' on in the backroom (Uh oh). I see you I never knew what it was you were goin' through. But I can relate I used to wear the same shoes. So quit livin' like a hypocrite and be real. Like an opposite of counterfeit. And you'll feel what it is you're really up against. Stop foolin' yourself not foolin' anyone else. I hope you're getting this</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>You're not the same man you were before. Tell me what are you like behind closed doors. I can't take this anymore. To see these people slippin' out through the back door</segment3>
		<segment4>So what's the point of even trying to hide. Cause everything you do is seen by omnipotent eyes. So come outside and leave behind. Don't be satisfied with the backslide we on the flipside. Sometimes it's so easy to cheat. But the only one's you're cheatin' are just you and the Chief. It ain't just a belief He'll be back like a thief. You better breathe get your things and leave. I know you will eventually</segment4>
		<segment5>When you gonna come out to play. When you gonna come out to stay. When you gonna come out to say. That you'll never turn the other way    </segment5>
