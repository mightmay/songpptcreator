		<segment1>Side by side we face each other. Standing here alone together. Your code ill break, you made your last mistake. Called out cold war. Remnants now on the floor </segment1>
		<segment2>This is Russian radio here. Calling you to come back home. This is Russian radio here. Run while you still can </segment2>
		<segment3>Different sides we take our stance. this could be our last goodbye forever. Your spies come clean, they told me everything. Your moves I make, penance the fire drake </segment3>
		<segment4>And if this is our last goodbye. let me kiss your lips of red tonight. and walk the other way. Run away, run away. This is our last, this is our last goodbye     </segment4>
