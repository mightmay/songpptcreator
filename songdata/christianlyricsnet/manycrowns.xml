		<segment1>A crown of thorns, a mockery of You, my God, of You, my King. You took my place, a place so bleak and cold</segment1>
		<segment2>A crown of thorns, a symbol of a desperate deed, Your desperate love. Your kindness, Lord, resounds inside of me</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus:). There will never be a crown so cruel. You wore it like a king, a king of fools. You will always be the only King of kings</segment3>
		<segment4>A crown of thorns, a crown of hate. For all You had, for all You gave. The king of all would rather serve than reign</segment4>
		<segment5>There will never be a crown so cruel. You wore it like a king, a king of fools. You will always be the only king of kings</segment5>
		<segment6>Crowned with many crowns. You are, crowned with many crowns. Crowned with many crowns. You are, crowned with many crowns</segment6>
		<segment7>A crown of thorns, a crown of death. Forsaken by both God and man. But You prevailed to live and reign again</segment7>
		<segment8>(And I know that) there will never be a crown so cruel. You wore it like a king, a king of fools. You will always be the only king of kings. The only king of kings. The only king of kings</segment8>
		<segment9>.     </segment9>
