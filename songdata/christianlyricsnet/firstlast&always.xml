		<segment1>Verse 1: So much that glitters and shines. In this world, wild and wonderful. So much that captures my mind, Still all my thoughts turn to you. You should know, I think of you.. </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: First, last &amp; always. First, last &amp; always. You gave my life back to me. And forever you'll be. First, last &amp; always. </segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Heroes that I wished were me, There's so much to aspire to. Visions I prayed I'd see, Now all these dreams turn to you. You know, I think of you.. </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus:.. </segment4>
		<segment5>Always, you're on my mind, All of the time. Always, I dream of you. Always, I long for you. Always, I live for you.    </segment5>
