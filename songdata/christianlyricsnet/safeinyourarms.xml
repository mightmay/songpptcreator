		<segment1>I'm in a dangerous place, no direction within. I feel lost in myself, trapped in my skin. It's a critical state, in my mind I can tell. that the future looks dim if I don't get some help. I am lost without You </segment1>
		<segment2>(CHORUS). Safe in Your arms. When I'm weak, You carry me. I am Safe in Your Arms. You're my strength. You're my safety </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, looking back all the years. All the blood sweating tears. There were times it was hard and I fell apart. You're the light at the end, on the road You're a friend. When I wanna give up, You keep showing love. I know I'd be lost without You </segment3>
		<segment4>With You I'd never walk alone. I know, I know where I belong. 'Cuz You carry me </segment4>
		<segment5/>
		<segment6>I'm not alone (x4)    </segment6>
