		<segment1>It was a quarter till 8. Secretly glad you were late. I hope you didn't see peeping through the window. I didn't want to seem too eager. I opened the door ready to leave. And then my dad walked us all the way out to the car that was embarrassing</segment1>
		<segment2>It's 2 am, it's gonna be another long night thinking 'bout what could have been. If I have been a little more this, a little more that, a little more everything you want. (x2)</segment2>
		<segment3>I laughed a little too loud. (I laughed a little too loud). Oh how awkward do I sound?. (Oh how awkward do I sound). I wondered about halfway through my story. If you even thought that it was funny. A few times I forgot how to speak. Because you look so stunning</segment3>
		<segment4>It's 2 am, it's gonna be another long night thinking 'bout what could have been. If I have been a little more this, a little more that, a little more everything you want. (x2)</segment4>
		<segment5>Woah everything you want</segment5>
		<segment6>I played (I played). This night (This night). Again (Again). And again inside my head. I hoped. It could. Have been. Almost perfect in the end. I guess now I'll try to fall asleep</segment6>
		<segment7>It's 2 am, it's gonna be another long night thinking 'bout what could have been. If I have been a little more this, a little more that, a little more everything you want. (x2)</segment7>
		<segment8>Woah everything you want    </segment8>
