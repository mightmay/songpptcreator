		<segment1>The spirit of God is calling. Calling to men. Stirring within our hearts a call. To faithfulness again. First to our God. Then in our homes. Faithful in all we are. And with all that we own </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus </segment2>
		<segment3>I answer the call. I take my stand. I choose to live my days on earth. A faithful man. And to that end. I give my all. And in the strength and grace of God. I answer the call </segment3>
		<segment4>I understand that no man. Can stand on his own. But thanks be to the spirit. We'll never stand alone. Now by His will I choose to be. All that the father said. That His children could be </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus </segment5>
		<segment6>A call to dedicate our lives. To nurture our children and love our wives. A call to guard our hearts and eyes. To press toward the goal -- To win the prize </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus (3 times)</segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
