		<segment1>Times are hard. Times have changed. Don't you say. But I keep holding on to you. It's hard to keep the faith alive day to day. Leaning on the strength I've found in you. You're the hope of all the Earth</segment1>
		<segment2>You are my hope. You are my strength. You're everything. Everything I need. You are my hope. You are my life. You are my hope. You are my hope</segment2>
		<segment3>Far beyond what I can see or comprehend. Etching your eternity in me. Nations stream and angels sing, &quot;Jesus reigns&quot;. And every knee bows down. You're the hope of all the Earth</segment3>
		<segment4>You are my hope. You are my strength. You're everything. Everything I need. You are my hope. You are my life. You are my hope. You are my hope</segment4>
		<segment5>Carry on and I sing of how. You love and I love you now. All the times that I start to sink. You come and you rescue me. You are my hope. You are my hope    </segment5>
