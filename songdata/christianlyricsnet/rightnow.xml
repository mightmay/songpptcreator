		<segment1>You want a change, it's written on your face. You feel alone, a little out of place</segment1>
		<segment2>You hide away the scars and the mistakes. You've been tired, uninspired, something's gonna give</segment2>
		<segment3>Right now. He knows who you are. The light and the dark. He picks up your broken heart. Right now. He's telling the truth. That you will make it through. His love can rescue you. Right now. Right now</segment3>
		<segment4>We've all been there, we're walking down the same road. So don't be scared, you're not out there on your own. Just take a breath and shut out the madness. Letting go is beautiful. There's so much more. Just waiting there for you</segment4>
		<segment5>Right now. He knows who you are. The light and the dark. He picks up your broken heart. Right now. He's telling the truth. That you will make it through. His love can rescue you. Right now</segment5>
		<segment6>This is your life. The giving and the taking. A journey in the making. This is your life. The fighting and the kneeling. The hurting and the healing. Don't throw it all away.. all away..</segment6>
		<segment7>Right now. He knows who you are. The light and the dark. He picks up your broken heart. Right now. He's telling the truth. That you will make it through. His love can rescue you. Right now</segment7>
		<segment8>He knows who you are. The light and the dark. He picks up your broken heart. Right now. He's telling the truth. That you will make it through. His love can rescue you. Right now. Right now</segment8>
