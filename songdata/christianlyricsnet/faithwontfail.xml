		<segment1>You could throw me in the fire. And I wont be burned. For my faith is your desire. And your love endures</segment1>
		<segment2>You could throw me in the prison cell. Shackle me up against the rail. But time and time again. My faith wont fail (repeat)</segment2>
		<segment3>For Hell prevail. In the midst of all my trials and tribulations. And Hell prevail. In the midst of all my sin and temptations. Hell prevail. When I fail and He will pick me up. For time and time again My faith wont fail (repeat)</segment3>
		<segment4>You could throw me in the lions den. But they wont harm me. For Your grace surrounds me. And it sets me free</segment4>
		<segment5>And I can walk upon the water. And I will not drown. For my eyes are set upon You. And no one can bring me down</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>For His angels surround me. And youve poured out this blood covering. And I will walk and not fail. For time and time again My faith wont fail (repeat)</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS    </segment8>
