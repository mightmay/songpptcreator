		<segment1>Your words aside, I search your face, to read your heart. To know intent and learn motives for your actions. Your will is hurt, you speak in spite, in haste you judge. Eyes that pierce, pierce through and try to find my faults. Tounge like a sword, I try to put it aside but it eats me alive. God I pray give me strength, To love all my enemies. And do unto them, as I would have them do unto me.     </segment1>
