		<segment1>It's cold outside. Or is that just the chill I feel inside from standing here. Steeping in my shame. I can't deny. I'm surrounded by the very thing You freed me from. That's why I can't come home</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I don't know where I turned around. From chasing what I always found completed me. More than I could dream. I don't know why I can't remain. Safe here where I always came to meet with you. And You always met with me. And You're still here waiting</segment2>
		<segment3>I fail to see. Why You'd still be waiting to forgive me. After all that I have done. But I cannot say. That one time I returned and You had turned away. Your love never fails</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>You say, &quot;Come home&quot; and You'll be there. I can run into Your arms</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
