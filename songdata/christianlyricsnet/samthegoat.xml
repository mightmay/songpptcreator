		<segment1>There once was a goat by the name of Sam. Sam ate grass stayed away from ham. An old little goat with a lot of regrets. Sam didn't fit in with the rest of the pets. He did his own thing let his hair grow long. Went into the mountains to write some songs. Down from the hill he began to tread. And all the younger goats, they began to dread. &amp;quot;Awe here comes Sam the Goat, the one and only master&amp;quot;. Quote unquote. Sam made friends that put on shows. Made money from the rich and wore fancy clothes. They set up an event Thursday afternoon. The whole town came to hear Sam's new tune. The old goat clicked onto the stage. Sung one song and the crowd was amazed</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: The goat, come on, goat, come on. Goat, come on, goat, everybody! (2x)</segment2>
		<segment3>Sam made riches Sam made girls. Touched four points of the globe in one twirl. Custom made goat suits and Prada boots. Let everybody know that the goat had loot. Now Sam kinda like the way this made him feel. Sam got prideful Sam got ill. Started doin' coke in the back of the bus. Drinking white russians out of plastic cups. Smacking his manager spitting on fans. Made the headlines without a marketing plan. Four star hotels five star cds. Dinner in London goats on four knees. Sam the old goat was on top of the world. And all the younger ones wanted to steal his pearls. Private goat jets daily death threats. Sam didn't fit in with the rest of the pets</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Soon the old goat felt all alone. And his list of regrets turned into a tall poem: the goat    </segment5>
