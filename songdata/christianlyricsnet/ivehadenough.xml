		<segment1>I've had enough and I can't take it anymore. so tell me how much is too much to bend your knees on the floor. And cry to God to save you from this sack of flesh. I know you know about the way but still you laugh another day. I wanna scream and kick some sense into your head. Why must you hit the bottom line. Why must u wait until your Dead! Dead! Dead. Sick of being sick? Don't you wanna be free! Sick of being sick?. Don't you wanna be free! Bondage to deadly disease. Sick of being sick? Don't you wanna be free! Sick of being sick?. Don't you wanna be free! Bondage to deadly disease. I've Had Enough!. I've had enough and I can't take it anymore. so tell me how much is too much to bend your knees on the floor. And cry to God to save you from this sack of flesh. I know you know about the way but still you laugh another day. I wanna scream and kick some sense into your head. Why must you hit the bottom line. Why must you wait until your dead. Why can't you see the flashing sign. Why must you walk that rode ahead. I slowly put my gloves on..cause I'm an usher at your funeral. Your caskets riding in the cadillac. Our family's crying what a total waste!. He was so young and very promising. The drugs and drinking took him far away. But it's all better cause he's in a nicer place.. And it's all better cause he's in a nicer place!!! (6x). Do you think that hell is nicer than this place. Tormenting flames and burning pain. The teeth are gnashing night and day. I'VE HAD ENOUGH!!!. (Matt 18:8-9).     </segment1>
