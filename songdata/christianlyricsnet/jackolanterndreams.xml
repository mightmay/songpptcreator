		<segment1>How can I explain when you just don't get it?. I'll take half a grapefruit and tea. Why should I explain when you just won't see it?. Nothing here but jack 'o' lantern dreams</segment1>
		<segment2>Remember through the darkness that we waltz on a knife. For the union of disunion and fight. The contagious in their cages and the rest of us dodging the curse. When the answers to these cancers is far worse</segment2>
		<segment3>How can I explain when you just don't get it?. I'll take half a grapefruit and tea. Why should I explain when you just won't see it?. Nothing here but jack 'o' lantern dreams</segment3>
		<segment4>Only if you can remember the ending. Can we then work back toward the start</segment4>
		<segment5>How can I explain when you just don't get it?. Hold on to the mouse you set free. Why should I explain when you just won't see it?. Nothing here but jack 'o' lantern dreams</segment5>
		<segment6>Nothing here but jack 'o' lantern dreams</segment6>
		<segment7>Nothing here but Jack and his dreams     </segment7>
