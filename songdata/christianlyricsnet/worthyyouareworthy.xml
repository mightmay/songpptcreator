		<segment1>Worthy, You are worthy. Much more worthy than I know. I cannot imagine. Just how glorious You are. And I cannot begin to tell. How deep a love You bring. O Lord my ears have heard of You. But now my eyes have seen</segment1>
		<segment2>You're worthy. You're worthy. You're worthy. You're worthy to be praised. Forever and a day</segment2>
		<segment3>Glory, I give glory. To the One who saved my soul. You found me and You freed me. From the shame that was my own. And I cannot begin to tell. How merciful You've been. O Lord, my ears had heard of You. But now my eyes have seen</segment3>
		<segment4>We'll sing an anthem of the highest praise. We'll sound an anthem of Your glorious name    </segment4>
