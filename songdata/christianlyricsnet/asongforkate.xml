		<segment1>we breathe the same air. you should have been there. you would have seen the way her eyes danced. and when the moon it hits the water it shines in the same way. we need a change if you give me a chance. we could fly away far away from this place. i know we can be we tend to agree. it makes more sense to do it this way. with integrity. i want to break this. i want to break this. we need to change. if we give it to him. he could take it away. don't you want it erased.     </segment1>
