		<segment1>Wanna go with me?. Do I have to wear. A shirt and tie?. We can take a limousine. But everybody there will. Ask us why!. Ain't nothin' wrong. We can have. A little fun and play. As long as we never forget. How to stop and pray!</segment1>
		<segment2>If you've been set. On partying 'til your head is numb. Betta not forget. That the party is when the. Kingdom comes!. Come on and dance. All your troubles away. And look thru the. Windows of heaven. It's not too late</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: My life Yeah. It's your life Yeah. Don't want to get it wrong. It's time to get it right. My life Yeah. It's your life Yeah. Need to make a change. Time for saving. My life</segment3>
		<segment4>I was a mess. But that was all before. I told Him yes!. Now it's all good. 'Cause everyone in His will. Is blessed!. Just let Him take. All your troubles away. Look thru the. Windows of heaven. It's not too late</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Don't wanna wait too long. It might be too late</segment6>
