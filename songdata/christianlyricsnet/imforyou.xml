		<segment1>Tell me where its hurting. Are you burning?. Running just to catch your breath. And going nowhere. It's getting old when you feel like you got nothing left. Well it ain't over 'til it's over. I told you since the day we met. So let me be the voice through all the noise. Whatever I gotta be. I'll be for you</segment1>
		<segment2>Whatever you need from me. To see you through. Everyone of us has stumbled. Everybody's humbled. We hit the ground and our lives crumble</segment2>
		<segment3>Whatever I gotta be. I'll be for you. I'm for you. If you never knew. If you never knew. I'm for you. You know it's true</segment3>
		<segment4>I know the feeling. I know it's real when the drama's all in your face. You see a mountain. I hear a promise - it's never more than we can take. Well it ain't over, 'til it's over. We can learn from our mistakes. So let me be the voice through all the noise</segment4>
		<segment5>Everyone of us will fall. Have our backs against the wall. And everyone shares a need to be loved. You've always been for me. So I will be for you. That's just what it means to love.     </segment5>
