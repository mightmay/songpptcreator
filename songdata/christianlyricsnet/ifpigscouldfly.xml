		<segment1>Why does God refuse to move?</segment1>
		<segment2>If pigs could fly they'd fly away and never grace the earth again. I wait and wait and wait and wait but nothing good happens for me</segment2>
		<segment3>I pray to fly but when I die my feet are still flat on the ground. my brain is good, no legs of wood, but if you could, I think you should</segment3>
		<segment4>He ain't standin in my way. cause I did nothin today. He ain&quot;t standin in my way</segment4>
		<segment5>Your ship has crashed no sign of shore-to sit in your lifeboat-you can do no more. 5 days at sea starved to the core-lifeboat is leaking-a rip in the floor</segment5>
		<segment6>solo 1: Ted solo 2: Aaron</segment6>
		<segment7>But wait-on the horizon-land-land hoe!. will you sit there and pray-or will you get up and row?. The next time you are quick to say &quot;I'm just waitin' on the Lord&quot;. just make sure that you remember where we all have been before</segment7>
		<segment8>All things become one.     </segment8>
