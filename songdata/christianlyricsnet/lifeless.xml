		<segment1>Desperate and waiting, frozen to the core, numb. To this feeling, needing something more all i. Keep thinking is where i need to be, all i can hope. For is someone to take me away</segment1>
		<segment2>Before you go you promise me something, i need. To know will you leave me lifeless leaving me. Lifeless</segment2>
		<segment3>Will i bow down to this life that i live, will i find. Freedom or lose it all again all i keep thinking is. Where i need to be, all i can hope for is someone. To take me away</segment3>
		<segment4>Before you go you promise me something, i need. To know will you leave me lifeless time moves so. Slow, i'm waiting for something, waiting for. Something again</segment4>
		<segment5>Will i fall away from you, feelings that i never. Knew and i hope that i never fall away    </segment5>
