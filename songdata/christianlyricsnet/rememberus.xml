		<segment1>God of goodness, God of grace. See the tears upon our face. We are restless for the day that you come for us all </segment1>
		<segment2>But our place is here right now. Still this place is breaking down. And some days we dont know how. We will make it at all </segment2>
		<segment3>When our hearts are breaking. And our darkest hour is upon us. When the storm is raging. God of heaven, please remember us </segment3>
		<segment4>When the light of day is gone. And our suffering is long. we lift up our needful song. to the Maker of all </segment4>
		<segment5>When our hearts are breaking </segment5>
		<segment6>And our darkest hour is upon us. When the storm is raging. God of heaven, please remember us. Please remember us. Glory, we cry Glory. All for your Glory, we cling to you </segment6>
		<segment7>When our hearts are breaking. And our darkest hour is upon us. When the storm is raging. God of heaven, please remember us </segment7>
		<segment8>When our hearts are breaking. And our darkest hour is upon us. When the storm is raging. God of heaven, please remember us    </segment8>
