		<segment1>Goodbye, youve chosen your path. Im sticking to mine. Whos going to stop you now.</segment1>
		<segment2>Look back to the times where weve pointed out the stupidity of society.. Oh.. ..of society.. of society. Never again will I rage this war with myself. Never again will I bow down on.. on my knees. Never again will I rage this war with myself.</segment2>
		<segment3>When all is said and done I will hold strong. When all is said and done I will hold strong.</segment3>
		<segment4>Nothing will stop me now. Ive made my stand, and Im never going back, Im never going back. Ive made my choice, so Ill use this voice and believe. Making waves in these dark waters isnt as easy as it looks. Nothing will stop me now. Nothing will stop me now. Nothing will stop me now. Nothing will stop me now.</segment4>
		<segment5>For I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Oh.. Oh... No, nothing will stop me. No, nothing will stop me. No..     </segment5>
