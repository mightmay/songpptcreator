		<segment1>What a sad sad picture to paint. of a dirty, dirty little soul. We are so blind here. Let's watch this all fall apart</segment1>
		<segment2>Find it hard to believe in it, believe in it. believe in what you give to me. never thought i would find you here, find you here. find you bearing him let go. Try run to either side, either side and lets see how your limbs hold up. Eventually we will sink or swim, sink or swim. sink into the great abyss.     </segment2>
