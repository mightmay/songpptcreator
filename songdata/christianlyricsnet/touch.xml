		<segment1>I, I really want to get to know you. I really want to get to show you how. How I really feel. And now, another page is turning. Another day is dawning here. For everyone to see</segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm on my knees. 'Cause I love you. And when you, touch my life. I've been born again. I am born again. And when you, touch my life. I've been born again. I am born again</segment2>
		<segment3>I, I really want to get to know you. I really wish you'd show me how. The way it's meant to be. And please, deliver me from walking. Beyond the truth that called me here. I'm not ashamed today</segment3>
		<segment4>I've been torn again, The curtain's been torn again    </segment4>
