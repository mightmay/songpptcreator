		<segment1>Looking down they're rising slowly. Veins that use to hide now showing. Blood that shows no sign of slowing. It's Your love inside me growing</segment1>
		<segment2>Can You feel my heartbeat pumping. Can You feel my heartbeat pumping</segment2>
		<segment3>It's rushing through my veins. A love I can't contain. My heart will soon give way. It's nothing I can fake. Your blood has sealed my fate. As my heart begins to break</segment3>
		<segment4>Your love's breaking in my heart again. Your love activates adrenaline. Your love's shaking underneath my skin</segment4>
		<segment5>My heart is beating through my chest. Will it explode let's take a guess. It's pumping harder every breath. This heartbeat started with a death</segment5>
		<segment6>Can You feel my heartbeat pumping. Can You feel my heartbeat pumping</segment6>
		<segment7>Can you hear it. Can you see it. Can you feel it. My heart it beats for you. It beats for love.     </segment7>
