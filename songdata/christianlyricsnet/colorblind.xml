		<segment1>On a good day. You break my heart again. On the highway. You run me over when. You are leaving me and taking everything</segment1>
		<segment2>Everyone sees. You at work. And they all think. I'm not worth. The trouble that you go through gets you nowhere</segment2>
		<segment3>Like waking up before you land. I guess you figured we're no good. I guess I'll never understand</segment3>
		<segment4>By the time you. Hear my crying. Will you feel like. Understanding. Plans to keep you by my side my darling</segment4>
		<segment5>Is the gift of. True belief. Is so hard to believe. When all you seem to want to do is get away</segment5>
		<segment6>Like pillows underneath a fall. It's not so bad to stick around. It doesn't have to hurt at all</segment6>
		<segment7>Every folly, every quarter I have lost. Takes some adding and some blood to count the cost. But I've done all that I could</segment7>
		<segment8>All the rainbows are black and white. And I'm colorblind. And I don't see nothing anymore. I don't see nothing anymore. And I don't know what I'll do without you    </segment8>
