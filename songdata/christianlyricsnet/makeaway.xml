		<segment1>She was only 17. Wild at heart and following her dreams. Believing she was pretty. Got a ticket to the city. Where she'd find her place on the cover of a magazine</segment1>
		<segment2>It was only a chat room, but it would lead the way. To the door of a man where she'd throw it all away. He said they'd take it slow. But little did she know. She'd be all used up by the end of the day</segment2>
		<segment3>But she was strong. And she would survive. Ambition would be her drive. And she said..</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll make a way. I'll do whatever it takes. Even though it won't be easy. I have a plan and though I may not understand. Someday, I'll make a way</segment4>
		<segment5>Where did she go wrong, how did she get here?. Livin' hard and looking older than her years. Miss Little Big Town. Trying to hold a job down. Doing what she could to choke her fears</segment5>
		<segment6>But she was strong. And she would survive. A spark of hope had kept her dream alive. And she cried..</segment6>
		<segment7>I'll make a way. I'll do whatever it takes. Even though it won't be easy. I have a plan and though I may not understand. Someday, I'll make a way. Someday, I'll make a way</segment7>
		<segment8>Walking down the road. In the city where she'd come with so much hope. Her vision had long died. Along with all her pride. And she found herself at the end of her rope</segment8>
		<segment9>But she heard angels through the door. Of a church she'd passed a million times before. There was a song of heaven ringing. And soon she found herself believing. That out there maybe there was something more</segment9>
		<segment10>So she bowed her head to pray. And said, Jesus, please make a way</segment10>
		<segment11>And she heard Him say..</segment11>
		<segment12>I'll make a way. I'll do whatever it takes. Even though it won't be easy. I have a plan and though you may not understand. Today, I'll make a way</segment12>
		<segment13>Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Today He'll make a way     </segment13>
