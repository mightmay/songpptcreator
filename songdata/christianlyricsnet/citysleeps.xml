		<segment1>V1:  Sit outside tonight, Can't believe my eyes  All the rain in the streetlights  I cannot say a word, you whisper in my ear And I know your here  Chorus: I've been away for so long, I miss youYou've been waiting for me here I could stay in this place, forever  You were waiting for me here  V2: The City falls asleep, All except for me Your Love has set me free The Sun wakes up the nightNow my eyes can seeYour Love has set me free  Bridge: You are the hope that I had lost You are the Joy I could not find You are the reason I came home again And left my fear behind Outro:I could not say a word, you whisper in my ear And I know your here    </segment1>
