		<segment1>In search for power no answer you will find when searching in darkness, feeling around blind. Demon powers willing to let you think you rule till that fatal day when they will rule you.</segment1>
		<segment2>Strength of steel is fleeting no power in that scene. Humanity is weak why don't you just believe, for none can stand the power of Almighty God, He will stand before you rule with iron rod. Upholds the universe by his word of power, All will face his glory, the unrighteous they will cower. Stand before Him naked and stripped of all your pride. Ashamed of your wrong doing and who'll be by your side.</segment2>
		<segment3>POWER in Almighty God. POWER in eternal life. POWER in the Word of God. POWER in the blood of Christ (2x)</segment3>
		<segment4>(Repeat Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>In search for power no answer you will find. When searching in darkness, feeling around blind. Demon powers willing to let you think you rule, till that fatal day when they will rule you. Life is but a vapor a speck of dust in time. When this life is over where's your power now. The Lord who's Lord of All is not willing any perish. There's power in the blood to wash and make your righteous.</segment5>
		<segment6>POWER in Almighty God. POWER in eternal life. POWER in the Word of God. POWER in the blood of Christ (2x).     </segment6>
