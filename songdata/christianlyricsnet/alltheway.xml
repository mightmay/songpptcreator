		<segment1>Come close to me, too close for words. And still my beating heart. I find your thoughts without one glance. We're going all the way</segment1>
		<segment2>With you I'm washed as white as the snow. And all crimson stain becomes just a shadow. You know I would be blind without you. So light up my way to find my way home. Today, today, today, we're going all the way</segment2>
		<segment3>Tears sometimes fall upon my face. And join the oil of gladness. How can it be I've found this love. A love that let me fly</segment3>
		<segment4>With you I'm washed as white as the snow. And all crimson stain becomes just a shadow. You know I would be blind without you. So light up my way to find my way home again. Today, today, today, we're going all the way</segment4>
		<segment5>Today, today, today, we're going all the way.     </segment5>
