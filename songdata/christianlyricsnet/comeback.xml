		<segment1>I ask myself the question why. before I break down and cry. my friends are falling left and right. was it faith or just an act that got you to the point you're at?. I don't know but I want you back. so just tell me why?. I really want to know. no way- I'll never let you go. no I am with you 'til the end. just bring back the old you once again. I never will forget those words from your mouth that I once heard. you don't know how much they hurt. you told me you could care no more. for something you used to live for. this can't be happening to you. so make up your mind there's not much time. the answer is waiting for you. every knee is gonna bow. and all the people will confess what Jesus Christ is all about. here's the reason you must know. so you don't become one of those. all by yourself in the end, left wondering WHY?!    </segment1>
