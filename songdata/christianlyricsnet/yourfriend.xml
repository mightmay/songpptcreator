		<segment1>If the wind will blow. I will hold you hand. When the sun won't shine, I will never fade away. When the tears appear. To wip away you smile. Don't be afraid, I'll be here</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I will be your friend, who will always care. I'll be the first to catch you if ever you should fall. And hold you in my arms. I will be your friend. If you lose your place. In life's crazy race. You can make it through. Cause I will run with you. We'll always pray and. Believe in our hearts. That God will be here by our side</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>God knows our imperfections. And he loves us anyway. A closer friend than I could ever be. But a little piece of heaven. I will do my best to bring. You'll never have to search again</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>I will be your friend, one who will always care. I'll be a little closer when you feel so far away. And hold you in my arms. I will be your friend    </segment6>
