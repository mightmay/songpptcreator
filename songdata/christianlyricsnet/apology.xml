		<segment1>It's hard to take the blame but sometimes credit's due. It's easier to rearrange what's wrong from what is true. The focus is not on you, what part could I have had?. I'm sorry if I messed things up, I wasn't meaning to</segment1>
		<segment2>And I realize now, it doesn't matter how. I'm responsible for my actions. And yours are up to you</segment2>
		<segment3>And I realize now, I can't be the judge. If I only see the wrong you've done. Then the wrong should be on me</segment3>
		<segment4>The circumstantial disagreements that we face. Are better when the truth about them doesn't get misplaced. My senseless rational kicks in and takes control. The words I spoke are said and done, they're meaningless the same</segment4>
		<segment5>And I realize now, it doesn't matter how. I'm responsible for my actions. And yours are up to you</segment5>
		<segment6>And I realize now, I can't be the judge. If I only see the wrong you've done. Then the wrong should be on me</segment6>
		<segment7>And I realize now, it doesn't matter how. I'm responsible for my actions. And yours are up to you</segment7>
		<segment8>And I realize now, I can't be the judge. If I only see the wrong you've done. Then the wrong should be on me    </segment8>
