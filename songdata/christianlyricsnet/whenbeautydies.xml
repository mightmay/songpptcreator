		<segment1>To god of lust, to god of pleasure, now build your sacrificial alter. upon this lying in surrender, murder your innocence. Lost within your lust you feed your hunger. Once your in you're pulled straight under. Addicted to flesh nakedness your splendor. Never willing to satisfy this need you've acquired. Justify how you call yourself clean, using this drug called pornography. Why can't you just break free from pornography?. It tears me up inside, to watch the beauty die. as the sacred act of sex is now thrown aside. To be replaced with lust and greed, the virgin's body now bleeds;. from the wounds of a lie that sold that body so cheap. Realize your worth. Realize your worth, steer clear of the perverse, sex is not a game. You'll be found dead in your shame.    </segment1>
