		<segment1>I was in need and I needed a friend. I was alone and I needed a hand. I was going down. But someone rescued me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: My God cares too much to say. His mercies are new everyday. I get down to pray. And then help is on its way</segment2>
		<segment3>I walk by faith and not by sight. If things go wrong, itll be alright. Cause someone greater. Is watching over me. (Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>Coda: Now in faith, I believe. Ive got everything I need. I walk by faith and not by what I see. Ive got friends in high places. Ive got someone I can call. And Ive got someone watching over me. (Verse)     </segment4>
