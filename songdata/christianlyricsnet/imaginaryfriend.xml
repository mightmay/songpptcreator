		<segment1>He's got a secret environment locked in his head. reality suspended. He's got a cast of characters cooped up in his mind. whenever he wants them</segment1>
		<segment2>Sitting in a corner admiring the sunbeams. with an imaginary friend. he frolics and plays but he's forgotten the only one. who can take away the pain. trading in what's real for a figment. a cashed in life locked up in his brain. they don't give diplomas from catatonic state</segment2>
		<segment3>He bears a ton of gruesome cargo, can't seem to equate. what is fact or fiction. gonna blow the escape hatch. from the miserable existence - find the Eden in his brain. the same cast fills his dreams and his nightmares. the horrors of night seem twice as harsh in the day. disconnected existence. pull the plug to ease the pain.     </segment3>
