		<segment1>My soul is weak. My heart is numb. I cannot see. But still my hope is found in You. Ill hold on tightly. You will never let me go. For Jesus, You will never fail. Jesus, You will never fail</segment1>
		<segment2>Simply to the cross i cling. Letting go of all earthly things. Clinging to the cross. Mercys found a way for me. Hope is here as i am free. Jesus, You are all i need. Clinging to the cross</segment2>
		<segment3>Even darkness is as light to You, my Lord. So light the way and lead me home. To that place where every tear is wiped away. For Jesus, You will never fail. Jesus, You will never fail</segment3>
		<segment4>Simply to the cross i cling. Letting go of all earthly things. Clinging to the cross. Mercys found a way for me. Hope is here as i am free. Jesus, You are all i need. Clinging to the cross</segment4>
		<segment5>What a Saviour, what a story. You were crucified but now You are alive. So amazing, such a mystery. You were crucified but now You are alive</segment5>
		<segment6>Simply to the cross i cling. Letting go of all earthly things. Clinging to the cross. Mercys found a way for me. Hope is here as i am free. Jesus, You are all i need. Clinging to the cross    </segment6>
