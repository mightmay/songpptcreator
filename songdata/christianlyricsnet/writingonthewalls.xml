		<segment1>Maybe we, Why don't we sit right here for half an hour. We'll speak of what a waste I am and how we missed your beat again</segment1>
		<segment2>I swear we need to find some comfort in this run down place. To bridge the gap of this conscious state that we live in. I'm short on time</segment2>
		<segment3>How come you try and fit the shape of what they tell you. But mostly what they show you. That brings us home. I pray for you to move on</segment3>
		<segment4>At this rate we can't keep up but I sure can't just sit still. I'm taking back all the things I said. Keep me filled in, I swear I'll come</segment4>
		<segment5>We walk alone back home</segment5>
		<segment6>You're almost gone and I'm ok to give you time to be afraid. I still see your shadow but never your face again. I remember your presence</segment6>
		<segment7>I hope to God you come down. I hope to God you can feel this now</segment7>
		<segment8>I know there must be some way out of here and all of them will be. Waiting here.     </segment8>
