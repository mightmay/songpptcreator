		<segment1>This is the hard part. Stopping to ask for directions. Sketching with these dirty colors just where I am</segment1>
		<segment2>You might have heard me. Artfully dodging the buzz words. Scoffing at your insinuation. Of just where I am</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm a long long way. From where I left to begin this refrain. From where Your mercy and grace remain. From where you sit is it true. It's not that far to You</segment3>
		<segment4>It happened slowly. Feet falling hard on the pavement. Eyes reaching into the distance. Toward empty sunsets</segment4>
		<segment5>Didn't I need to break out, want to be king. Wouldn't I face the gallows if I return. Or is a man freely pardoned. As I have heard</segment5>
		<segment6>Precious Jesus. Where can I flee from Your Spirit. You know me too well.    </segment6>
