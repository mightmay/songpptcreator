		<segment1>Don't grip, you're choking. What life was, trying to. Lift up the rage from a season of play. I don't blame my messes on you. Don't beat this down dead. Sink to a level that is low, low. Why not, what else is</segment1>
		<segment2>Low, Low. Why take the conscience. Low, low. Why not, what else is. Low, low. What not, what else is there</segment2>
		<segment3>I climb into. Recognize I don't have time. What was said about this man?. What was said now. Don't grip your choking. What life was trying to. Lift up the rage from a season of play. I don't blame my messes on you. Don't beat this down dead. Sink to a level that is. Low, low    </segment3>
