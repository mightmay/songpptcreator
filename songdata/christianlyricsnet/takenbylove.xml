		<segment1>The world will fade away. As I lift my hands. A king that's worthy of praise. Is the Great I Am </segment1>
		<segment2>The joy you've given rings out. As I lift my voice </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm captivated by your ways so I will worship You </segment3>
		<segment4>You've taken me by love. You've taken me by grace. You've taken me away. I can't resist because. You've taken heart </segment4>
		<segment5>All creation will bow. to the risen king. All of heaven will shout. And the earth sing </segment5>
		<segment6>The joy you've given rings out. As I lift my voice </segment6>
		<segment7>I'm captivated by your ways so I will worship You     </segment7>
