		<segment1>Brothers &amp; Sisters. We're gonna draw the line. To forget about the problems abroad. But in the end we all have problems of our own. Gangs, crack, racism and many people don't have hope. It porbably don't matter much to you. In the struggles, the time that we live. But you don't know your future. So you better take time to give. Who's gonna draw the line?. We're gonna draw the line. Together, forever and ever</segment1>
		<segment2>You must be thinking, I can't do a thing. But look at me I help when I sing. Where man can make a difference. Like Caesar, Chavez and doctor King. We all have the ability to release a positive capasility. Where the youth is our responsibility. It's time to take a stand</segment2>
		<segment3>Who's gonna draw the line?. We're gonna draw the line. Together, forever and ever</segment3>
		<segment4>Brothers &amp; Sisters. We're gonna draw the line to make people change. But yo I'm opitmistic, down with positivity. This is a struggle so prepare to fight</segment4>
		<segment5>Who's gonna draw the line?. We're gonna draw the line. Together, forever and ever.     </segment5>
