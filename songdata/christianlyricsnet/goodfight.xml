		<segment1>I give my all my everything. Anything you want I've tried to be. I tried, god knows I tried. Or am I stuck somewhere between. Who I am and who I hope to be. Am I fighting the good fight </segment1>
		<segment2>Keep pressing on. Fight the good fight. Fight, what you know is wrong. Keep pressing on. Fight the good fight. Fight, what you know is wrong </segment2>
		<segment3>I've come so far to fall too fast. As for? I can't look back I try. God knows I try. I shift my eyes to the sky. In the distance see the horizon line. She waits for me. Fighting the good fight </segment3>
		<segment4>Keep pressing on. Fight the good fight. Fight, what you know is wrong. Keep pressing on. Fight the good fight </segment4>
		<segment5>Fight, what you know is wrong </segment5>
		<segment6>I give my all my everything. Anything you want I strive to be. Am I stuck somewhere between. Who I am and who I hope to be. Fighting, I'm fighting. Fighting the good fight. Am I stuck somewhere in between. Who I am and who I hope to be </segment6>
		<segment7>Keep pressing on. Fight the good fight. Fight, what you know is wrong. Keep pressing on. Fight the good fight. Fight, what you know is wrong </segment7>
		<segment8>Remember that. Sometimes I fall in between. The nights blue moon and the shadows. Fight on, Fight the good fight. What you know is wrong. I'll keep fighting. Fight on, keep fighting the good fight. Fight on, fight on    </segment8>
