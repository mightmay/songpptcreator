		<segment1>We all like to hide behind our different faces. And we all like to pretend we're in different places. I don't need anyone to give me approval. And I don't mind if you laugh and call me a loser</segment1>
		<segment2>'Coz He's all I need. To live, to be. He's my decree. He's all I ever need</segment2>
		<segment3>We all like to brave our faith when misplace it. And we all like to call up too so when I make it. But you and me, we don't need to beg or steal or borrow. 'Coz we are kids of the King, of the great tomorrow</segment3>
		<segment4>He's all I need. To live, to be. He's my decree. He's all I ever need</segment4>
		<segment5>Hope in Him, trust in Him, reach for Him. Let the flood of God's tears drown the sea. That should've never been, never been</segment5>
		<segment6>He's all I need. To live, to be. He's my decree. He's all I ever need    </segment6>
