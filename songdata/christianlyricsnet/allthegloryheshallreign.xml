		<segment1>My heart is full of admiration. For You, my Lord, my God and King. Your excellence my inspiration. Your words of grace have made my spirit sing</segment1>
		<segment2>All the glory, honour and power. Belong to you, belong to you. Jesus, Saviour, Anointed One. I worship You, I worship You</segment2>
		<segment3>You love what's right and hate what's evil. Therefore your God sets you on high. And on your head pours oil of gladness. While fragrance fills your royal palaces</segment3>
		<segment4>Your throne, O God, will last forever. Justice will be your royal decree. In majesty, ride out victorious. For righteousness, truth and humility</segment4>
