		<segment1>You're only interested when our power's threatened. You're only paranoid cause you know what you're doing. You know what you've done and what you're about to do. The conspiracy to your inconsistency. Could it be your spirit's dead?. Why do you run away when faced with these questions?. I know you know it. But you just won't say you built this conformist system. You built this state and now you're falling down. Your education teaches us not to resist. Subjects don't question kings. It disrespect, they slam you in the face with their fist. You'll do anything to keep from falling down!.     </segment1>
