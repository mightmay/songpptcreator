		<segment1>I'm the guy that dies at the beginning of the movie. I'm the one who never makes it out of the cave. It's because just when I have got everything going. for me baby, you come around and take it all away.</segment1>
		<segment2>It's true, I would do anything for you.</segment2>
		<segment3>She asked if this is cool. What did you say?. I played it like a fool. Oh, no!. It's like I've said before, I could die tonight. for just one kiss more.</segment3>
		<segment4>On the brink, about to sink. I'm drowning baby and I can't think.. Of a way to pull myself back to shore. It's your face I can't take, and my knees are about to buckle. The same way as they did. the night you walked through my door.</segment4>
		<segment5>Every time my eyes are closing there is just one word. Once it's spoken, my eyes open, and I'm yours to serve.</segment5>
		<segment6>When your world tries. to blow itself up from the inside. I will dig a foxhole for two. So you know that I will always be there for you. And maybe you would find a love for me too.    </segment6>
