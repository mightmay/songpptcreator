		<segment1>Have you heard the prophecy in Revelation 1 2 3 4. Forsaking truth the earth will mourn as Christ returns. So it shall be. Isaiah, Joel, Luke and John all prophecied the wrath to come. There's a sea of blood. Mountains fall. God is screaming, &quot;WAKE UP CALL!&quot;. Hide us - From the wrath of the lamb. Kill us - Who can stand. Hide us - From the wrath of the lamb. Kill us - Who can stand. The machine is grinding. Genocide is coming. The horsemen are riding. Death is right behind.     </segment1>
