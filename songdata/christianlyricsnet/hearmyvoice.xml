		<segment1>You are the only one that brings me peace. You are the only one where hope is seen. The mercy you've given is more than I deserve. So I lay it down so I can heed your word</segment1>
		<segment2>Hear my voice, I raise to you. With honor and praise. All glory is due. I lay it all down at your feet. With lifted hands it's you we seek</segment2>
		<segment3>You are the only one that bring me truth. You are the only one that makes me new. The grace you've given a gift for all to see. So this is why I give you everything</segment3>
		<segment4>And to you I lift my voice. And to you I lift my hands. And to you I give my heart    </segment4>
