		<segment1>I will never be the same again, I can never return, I've closed the door. I will walk apart, I'll run the race. And I will never be the same again.</segment1>
		<segment2>I will never be the same again, I can never return, I've closed the door. I will walk apart, I'll run the race. And I will never be the same again.</segment2>
		<segment3>Fall like fire, soak like rain, Flow like mighty waters, again and again. Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff, And let a flame burn to glorify Your name.</segment3>
		<segment4>There are higher heights, there are deeper seas, Whatever you need to do, Lord do in me. The Glory of God fills my life, And I will never be the same again.</segment4>
		<segment5>Fall like fire, soak like rain, Flow like mighty waters, again and again. Sweep aways the darkness, burn away the chaff. And let a flame burn to glorify Your name.</segment5>
		<segment6>Fall like fire, soak like rain, Flow like mighty waters, again and again. Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff, And let a flame burn to glorify Your name.</segment6>
		<segment7>I will never be the same again, I can never return, I've closed the door. I will walk the path, I will run the race. And I will never be the same again. And I will never be the same again. And I will never be the same again.     </segment7>
