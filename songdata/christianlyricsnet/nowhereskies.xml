		<segment1>You're giving me chills. You've given me life. You're giving me thrills. Oh, what a ride. And I wanna feel warm. And I wanna feel right. I wanna feel good. Maybe tonight </segment1>
		<segment2>But the sun's gonna come out again. As the world keeps breaking you in. But I long to get lost in your nowhere skies. Nowhere skies, nowhere skies, nowhere skies </segment2>
		<segment3>You've taken me to a higher place. The world goes away but I feel the same. And I finally feel warm. And I finally feel right. And I finally feel good. Finally tonight.     </segment3>
