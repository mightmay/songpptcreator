		<segment1>The sunset through the blinds reminds me of the time we met. You were like a ray of sunlight, penetrating my apartment. As we walked down by the water I remember what you said. You said we had so much in common and you didnt see it coming. I was as surprised to find the love inside your eyes as you were to see mine. Our friends all laughed and we were warned it was the calm before the storm that comes like it always does</segment1>
		<segment2>Love of mine oh my how we have grown, it's different now. Dont ever want to go back to being alone, it's different now. And I wouldnt change a thing</segment2>
		<segment3>I recall the times we spent down by the coffee shop. We would fight and you would cry, cause in those days I lied a lot. Trying to protect you from the truth I had to learn that never worked. I couldnt hide anything from you, couldnt bare to see it hurt you. Oh I was so surprised to find forgiveness in your eyes, undeserved, but love is blind. We shared our hearts as we drove home it was the calm before the storm that comes like it always does</segment3>
		<segment4>After all the mistakes, its different now. It seems our love never breaks, its different now and I wouldnt change a thing.    </segment4>
