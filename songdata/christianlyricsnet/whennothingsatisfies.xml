		<segment1>When it rains or it shines on this pillow of mine. I will lift up my head to the sky. So I have chance to see. Where my hope has come from. Know there's nothing that I can't abide </segment1>
		<segment2>When Nothing Satisfies You. When nothing satisfies you. When nothing satisfies you. Hold my hand </segment2>
		<segment3>Send forth Your Light Lord, And send forth Your Truth. Let them guide me to Your Holy Place. Then will I go to the Altar of God. To my Joy, my Delight and my Strength </segment3>
		<segment4>When Nothing Satisfies You. When nothing satisfies you. When nothing satisfies you. Hold my hand </segment4>
		<segment5>Why are You so downcast o my soul?. Why so disturbed within me?. Put your hope in God. My Savior, my King. My Savior, my King </segment5>
		<segment6>When Nothing Satisfies You. When nothing satisfies you. When nothing satisfies you. Hold my hand </segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
