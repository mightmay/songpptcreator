		<segment1>As Your children gather in peace. All the angels sing in Heaven. In Your temple all that I seek. Is to glimpse Your holy presence</segment1>
		<segment2>All the heavens cannot hold You, Lord. How much less to dwell in me?. I can only make my one desire. Holding on to Thee</segment2>
		<segment3>All the angels exalt You on high. What a kingdom to depart!. But You left Your throne in the sky. Just to live inside my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>I will always make my one desire. Holding on to Thee    </segment4>
