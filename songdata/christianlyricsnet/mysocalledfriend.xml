		<segment1>Deep inside something is growing and it feels a lot like hate.</segment1>
		<segment2>Thought about you who I once called a friend. and the time we had till it came to this end. And even now as one last smile comes over my face. it brings back the bitterness that drives me to hate. Deep inside..</segment2>
		<segment3>Asked you for honesty, but all I got was hypocrisy, I just can't believe it took me so long to realize / see. I remember all the laughter and fun that we had, but you had nothing better to do than betray me. Deep inside..</segment3>
		<segment4>Certain moments in our life. blow right through our facade, they show us who we really are. and what we're made of. Deep inside..    </segment4>
