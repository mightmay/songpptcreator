		<segment1>Mark me with Your grace. Shape me in Your wisdom. Place in me a heart. Of mercy. Open up my eyes. Let me see Your glory. Lead me to the place. You want me </segment1>
		<segment2>Love, break me now. Strip me down. May Your beauty. Deep inside of me resound. Through me be found. Come break me now </segment2>
		<segment3>Guide me in Your truth. Mold me in Your nature. Birth in me a hope. To hold on. Show me how to wait. Teach me how to listen. Be in me the strength. To let go </segment3>
		<segment4>Break me now.. </segment4>
		<segment5>Love, hear my plea. Rescue me, bring Your peace. I have come to You on bended knee. I'm desperate for Your breath in me. Your ears to hear, Your eyes to see. Set me free, come set me free </segment5>
		<segment6>Like rain flowing over me..    </segment6>
