		<segment1>There's something different in your eyes. something honest in the way you speak. every time you come around me. one look at you and I feel at peace. the angels can't be very far. I love what I see in your heart</segment1>
		<segment2>I see God in you. I know that's not something you go around saying. but I do believe it's true. I see God in you. I want to say. I finally found my strength in the light that shines in you. That's what I see. I see God in you</segment2>
		<segment3>Did you know that you're the person. who's shown me who it is I want to be?. Every time I feel I'm falling. I can count on you to stand by me. I've never known someone like you before. how can I say how beautiful you are?</segment3>
		<segment4>I see God in you. I know that?s not something you go around saying. but I do believe it's true. I see God in you. I want to say. I finally found my strength in the light that shines in you. That's what I see. I see God in you</segment4>
		<segment5>God must have known just what I needed. someone to show me His true love. I know better now who He really is. I've seen a glimpse in you. I see God in you. I know that's not something you go around saying. but I do believe it's true. I see God in you. I want to say. I finally found my strength in the light that shines in you. That's what I see. I see God in you    </segment5>
