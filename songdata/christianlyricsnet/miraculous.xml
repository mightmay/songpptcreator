		<segment1>Glory nailed on to an old cross. Finding all that we've lost. Newing all that once was old. God in human form descended. The brokenness was mended. That's the greatest story that ever was told. And this light-it don't stop shining. And they can't take that away from me</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). And what a miraculous thing it is that you. know me-God that you know me. And what a miraculous thing it is that I know. you-Jesus I know you</segment2>
		<segment3>Heaven opened like a floodgate. A single drop of blood made the universe turn upside down. Deeper that the nails were driven, is the more sin was forgiven. Its Jesus death that keeps me living now. And this life-it don't stop shining. And they can't take that away from me</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>You may say it's just a story. But God and all his glory. Walked among the poor and the broken. The poor and the broken. The poor and the broken</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)                                                 </segment6>
