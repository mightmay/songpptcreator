		<segment1>So confined to the fear that you hold on to. Time unwinds and nothing seems. Promised you </segment1>
		<segment2>Hey wait, i want to take you for a ride. Hey wait, i want to catch you. While there's time </segment2>
		<segment3>Who'll(I'll) pick you up when there's no one. around?. Who'll(I'll) hold you up when your heart. Hits the ground? </segment3>
		<segment4>So defined by a love that has fallen through. But hope is kind. When you hope in something. You know is true </segment4>
		<segment5>You're tired and you can't take. Another time around. You know it's hope i'm holding. So i hope i've found you in this    </segment5>
