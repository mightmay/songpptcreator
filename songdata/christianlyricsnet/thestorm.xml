		<segment1>Come to my door. You know I'll let you in. Ask me what you will. Ask me anything. If you would only seek out. What you want to find. If you would only. If you would only try</segment1>
		<segment2>Come to my door. Do not be afraid. My words have made it clear. I will never leave. I know it's hard believing me. When others let you down. But would you let me. Would you let me in?</segment2>
		<segment3>When the storm is coming. And rain clouds fill the sky. All the world is drowning. I will hear your cry. And I will let you in. Fall into my arms. And I will keep you warm. I will let you in. Come into my house. Find shelter from the storm    </segment3>
