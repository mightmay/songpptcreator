		<segment1>Your fist broke the vein, Flowing straight to your heart. Ripping her world apart. So she'll be turning away.</segment1>
		<segment2>Away from you now. Leaving her out. To fight alone, To cry alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Her name is dancing. Off your lips, with hate. Flowing straight to here heart. And tearing her love apart, Yes she'll be turning away.    </segment3>
