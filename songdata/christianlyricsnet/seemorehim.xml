		<segment1>I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. I'm a be like Zacchae. In that Sycamore tree. I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. Lord I promise (I promise) I promise</segment1>
		<segment2>Prior to Jesus' life death and re-re-Resurrection. Having any affect on me left me in deception. Because the God of this world Satan blinded my mind. From seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of God. But then a miracle happened. We-we call it conversion. He opened the eyes of my blind heart and led me to worship. Gotta a peek at His beauty as He opened the crack. That captivated my nature and kept me coming back. He gave me taste buds to taste of freedom to love. And to delight in His loving kindness through Jesus' blood. And every since repentance I done been on this chase. To drink from this freedom fountain through His infinite grace. Namely seeking His face. Cause He removed the veil. Knocked me off my high horse and removed the scales. Now I've been exposed to His glorious light. That shines into the darkness in my heart and I'm like..</segment2>
		<segment3>I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. I'm a be like Zacchae. In that Sycamore tree. I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. Lord I promise (I promise) I promise</segment3>
		<segment4>Listen.. Though I'm a Christian my vision sometimes even get blurred. When I'm resisting His visits and not reading His Word. Desperate need to be purged. Easy to lose the wonder. Through these daily distractions banging louder than thunder. When I devalue my Savior and start treasuring trash. And longing for mud patches thinking it's greener grass. Exchanging eternal pleasures for the ones that's going to pass. Looking for 'em to satisfy but they lie never last. When captivated and activated by my deceitful lust. Is a lack of faith in my Father's grace and I need to place my trust. In everything that my Father is and everything that He supplied. Through the perfect life of His Son. Death and resurrection of Christ. And I know I got to trust Him. All this sin I got to trust Him. World that we in I got to trust Him. How I'm going to live if I just brush Him. Knowing that my heart is mad disgusting. Knowing that the Father had to crush. Yes just so we can be free. Please give me eyes to see</segment4>
		<segment5>I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. I'm a be like Zacchae. In that Sycamore tree. I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. Lord I promise (I promise) I promise</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord. See I'm reminded in my mind in my brother Zacchaeus. Who took some desperate measures just so that He could see Jesus. As joy accompanied the faith that He felt in his soul. That made me question myself, how far am I willing to go?. What am I willing to get rid of so I can get close?. And closer and closer Lord, fill me with Your Holy Ghost. Pour out Your Spirit empower me in increasing measures. To see Your uniqueness instead of these fleet-fleeting pleasures. Give me greater capacities to suffer and to carry. This cross on my back as I walk to my personal Calvary. And climb on the cross oh Lord as I stretch out my arms. Quoting the Psalms as they banging them nails in my palms. Until I die cause I was crucified with my Savior. And resurrected now I can reflect it in my behavior. A new nature to taste and savor Jesus the Christ. Who brought me out of the darkness to His marvelous light</segment6>
		<segment7>I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. I'm a be like Zacchae. In that Sycamore tree. I wanna see more of Him. Cause I'm sick of more of me. Lord I promise (I promise) I promise.     </segment7>
