		<segment1>(Chorus). Again I call You, and again You answer. Again I need You, and again You're there. Again I reach out, and again You hold me. You consile me once more, and again</segment1>
		<segment2>(Verse 1). When I needed company, someone. just to sit with me. When I need a helping hand, someone. to understand me. When I need someone who cares, someone to wipe away my tears. Reach out and calm my fears, I know that You'll be there</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>(Verse 2). Every time I turn around, the most. amazing thing I've found. You're there to pick me up each time. When I fall down. You never seem to mind and. You're always treating me so kind. Time after every time, You've proven once again</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>(Vamp). And again, You will come through once again    </segment6>
