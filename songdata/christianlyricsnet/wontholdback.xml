		<segment1>I know you thinkin what she bout to do now, With the crazy track, JDS in the back. Bangin in your system, can you feel the rhythm?. it's just the way God gave it to us. a crazy praise, just givin you a taste. of the many ways he made, for me his life he laid. you can't identify and you betta' not deny so open your mouth adn let it out let it out. CHORUS-. I wont hold back, Whoevers silent is wack. I gotta praise, cmon and open your mouth. I gotta praise, c'mon and scream it loud. got this power in me God delivered me. i gotta parise c'mon and open your mouth i got a praise c'mon and scream it loud. I need you get this, so come on and picture this. Tears of joy, with a joyful noise. With my knees on the floor, hands in the air. as if i stole?. Cuz if you only knew Jesus. Hes the best thing that could ever happen. That the human mind could evven think, cuz Hes so big. Thats why, Im gonna let it out (let it out). CHORUS (2xs). Are you really tryin to get your praise on? (3xs). Cuz Im a dance, dance. Yes Im really tryin to get my praise on (3xs). Cuz Im a dance dance. CHORUS (2xs)    </segment1>
