		<segment1>Can we die to live another day?. How could we lose sight. Of what matters most. Trying to love. What cannot love us back. All we have is not worth living for. If we do not know when to let go. What is this life. That we cling to it so tight. Afraid that it will take from us. These fading sentiments. Can we die.. Can we die to live another day? x3. What is this life. That we cling to it so tight. Afraid that it will take from us. These fading sentiments?. How could we lose sight. Of what matters most. Trying to love. What cannot love us back. All we have is not worth living for. If we do not know when to let go    </segment1>
