		<segment1>I never minded calling You a King. If that meant that I could count on You. To give me everything. I never thought to ask You. I always thought You knew. It was never my intention to question You </segment1>
		<segment2>You never minded calling me a child. Well, I guess that's how I acted all the while. But You live through every tantrum, You see through every lie. Though they seem to be more common. I just wanted You to know why oh why </segment2>
		<segment3>Unforgetful You, unforgetful. Unforgetful You, so unforgetful </segment3>
		<segment4>You never minded giving us the stars. Then showing us how blind and unaware of You we are. You painted me a picture and showed me how to see. Though I just won't behold it. Unless it pertains to me..     </segment4>
