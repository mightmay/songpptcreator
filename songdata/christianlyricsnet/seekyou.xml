		<segment1>Fold back, strip away these layers. Test me in these flames until. Only You remain. Shine through. Piercing through the darkness. Search out anything in me. Thank is not of You</segment1>
		<segment2>Seek You, Father God, I seek You. You are where. My treasure lies. Seek you, Father God, I seek You. You are where. My treasure lies</segment2>
		<segment3>Save me, take me through the wasteland. Father, you have heard my cry. And you rescued me. Grow me, Holy Spirit, mold me. Change me by Your mercy, God. To be more like you</segment3>
		<segment4>No more living in my own way. Following my own path. Living for my own desires. Surrender everything before You. Only for Your kingdom, Lord. Will I live my life</segment4>
		<segment5>Seek You, Father God, I seek You     </segment5>
