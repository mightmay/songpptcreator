		<segment1>i'll praise my maker while i have breathe. and when voice is lost in death. praise employs my nobler power. my days of praise will never be past. happy those whose hopes rely. on Israel's God who made the sky. earth and seas with all their train. and all the land that lies within. our God pours eyesight on the blind. he supports the fainting mind. his truth forever stands secure. he saves oppressed and feeds the poor. i'll praise my God who lends me breath. and when my voice is lost in death. praise employs my nobler powers. my days of praise will never be past. God helps the stranger in distress. the widowed and the fatherless. he grants the prisoner sweet release. and sends the laboring conscinece peace. i'll praise my God..    </segment1>
