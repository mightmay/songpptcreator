		<segment1>Fare thee well. Trade in all our words for tea and sympathy. Wonder why we tried, for things that could never be. Play our hearts lament, like an unrehearsed symphony </segment1>
		<segment2>Not intend. To leave this castle full of empty rooms. Our love the captive in the tower never rescued. And all the victory songs. Seem to be playing out of tune </segment2>
		<segment3>But it's not the way. That it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy. 'Cause it's not the way. That it has to be </segment3>
		<segment4>You begin. And all your words fall to the floor and break like china cups. And the waitress grabs a broom and tries to sweep them up. I reach for my tea and slowly drink in </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: 'Cause it's not the way. That it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy. 'Cause it's not the way. That it has to be. Don't trade our love for tea and sympathy </segment5>
		<segment6>So fare thee well. Words the bag of leaves that fill my head. I could taste the bitterness and call the waitress instead. She holds the answer, smiles and asks one teaspoon or two </segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus x 2] </segment7>
		<segment8>Don't trade us for tea and sympathy. Don't trade us for tea and Sympathy. We can work it out. Don't trade us for tea and Sympathy. Don't trade us for tea and Sympathy. We can work it out. Don't trade us for tea and Sympathy. We can work it out     </segment8>
