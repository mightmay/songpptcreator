		<segment1>I gotta get out of the way. I gotta get out of the way. Before it all comes down, before it all comes down. Crumbling down, crumbling down. Fallin down on me. Dont go, crumbling down, crumbling down. Crumbling down, fallin down on me</segment1>
		<segment2>Lift me up where angels fly, raise me up where stars collide. And go bursting into flames, burst me into flames. I just want to break into you. Tear me down beneath myself, bring me down where you reside. Where you love me endlessly, where you love me endlessly. I just wanna fall into you </segment2>
		<segment3>I gotta get into your place, I gotta get into your ways. Before it all comes down, before it all comes down. Crumbling down, crumbling down. Fallin down on me. Dont go, crumbling down, crumbling down. Crumbling down, fallin down on me</segment3>
		<segment4>I gotta get past myself. I gotta get past myself. To find out who you are. I know theres gotta be more, I know theres so much more. So wont you lift me up where angels fly</segment4>
