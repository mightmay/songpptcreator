		<segment1>Just when I though I was strong. Another weak day comes along. And all my righteousness goes wrong. But I was doing so well. My dreams to be a Godly man. Seem out of reach of my own hand. But where I fall short His grace still stands. If I have faith like a child</segment1>
		<segment2>And if Mondays child is fair of face. And Tuesdays child is full of grace. Then you can call me a Tuesdays child. Like Wednesdays child, Im full of woe. And Thursdays child Ive got far to go. But you can call me a Tuesdays child</segment2>
		<segment3>Sounds too easy some might say. Theres a bigger price to pay. But when Jesus gave His life away. It was once and for all. So with more of His grace filling me. I more than ever want to be. Growing up in purity. With the faith of a child</segment3>
		<segment4>And if Mondays child is fair of face. And Tuesdays child is full of grace. Then you can call me a Tuesdays child. Like Wednesdays child, Im full of woe. And Thursdays child Ive got far to go. But you can call me a Tuesdays child</segment4>
		<segment5>Thats what I want to be. Full of His grace for me. Knowing hes all I need</segment5>
		<segment6>And if Mondays child is fair of face. And Tuesdays child is full of grace. Then you can call me a Tuesdays child. Like Wednesdays child, Im full of woe. And Thursdays child Ive got far to go. But you can call me a Tuesdays child</segment6>
		<segment7>Thats what I want to be. Full of His grace for me. Knowing hes all I need. And if Mondays child is fair of face</segment7>
		<segment8>Sharing the grace he gives. Thats how I want to live. Free in His promises. I wan to be a Tuesdays child </segment8>
