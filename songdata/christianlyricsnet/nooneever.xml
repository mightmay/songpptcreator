		<segment1>no one ever cared for me like Jesus, no one ever gave their life for me, no one ever walked upon the water, no one ever made the blind man see, no one ever left a thousand people to come and find me wandering, no one ever cared for me like Jesus, no one ever gave their life for me...I never knew a world without you, till I decided to run away, I never took a breath without you, then you took my breath away, I never wrote a line about you, till you gave me an empty page, I never told a soul about you, till you gave me words to say, I can see something changing in me, and I don't understand but I feel so much peace..No one ever knew my deepest secrets before my first heartbeat, no one ever calmed the raging ocean, by speaking words of peace..no one can calm my storm, it's only you!    </segment1>
