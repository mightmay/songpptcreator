		<segment1>I cant win. Im writing it off. My backs pinned to the wall. Pull back, pull back, pull back the reins. Theres no doubt that all the fuss has just made a mess out of me. Pull back. Pull back. Let the cycle run its course.</segment1>
		<segment2>Remind me again, so I can re-learn, give me a crash course on how this works. I know Ive given ample advice, but as it seems the constant struggle. has made an example of me. Has made an example out of me.</segment2>
		<segment3>I cant win. Im writing if off. My backs pinned to the wall. Let it run, let the cycle run, let the cycle. Let it all run out its course. Im doing more harm every time I use force. Let the cycle run out because. when its done therell be something else.</segment3>
		<segment4>I didnt ask for this, but I keep embracing it. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. This has chosen me. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. This has chosen me. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. This has chosen me. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay. This has chosen me. Im gonna stay. Im gonna stay.     </segment4>
