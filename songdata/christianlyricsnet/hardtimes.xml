		<segment1>I smile when I remember all the things we did. The worlds we discovered when I was a kid. Sitting on your shoulders I was riding high. All of life before me I could see for miles. You gave me a life to love. Showed me the dreams I was dreaming of. Told me love was enough</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). When hard times come  hard times come. Hard times come for everyone. Hard times come  hard times come. And theyll come till were done</segment2>
		<segment3>Lately Ive been standing on my own two feet. Theres a pair of watchful eyes staring up at me. I will turn them to the sunrise. Turn them toward the stars. Where the beauty of a new day will always fill the heart. Give you a life to love. Show you dreams you were dreaming of. Just let love be enough</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Making you measure what youre made of. Helping you galvanize the love</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat Chorus    </segment6>
