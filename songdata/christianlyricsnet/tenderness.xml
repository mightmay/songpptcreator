		<segment1>Hush baby, don't cry. Just try to remember the time. When all your pitfalls and fears. Became mine</segment1>
		<segment2>And when we fall apart. Just one thing takes me back to the start</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus:). Tenderness. Put my heart to rest. Your tenderness. Hits me to the bone. Tenderness. When my head's a mess. Your tenderness. Keeps me coming home</segment3>
		<segment4>Hush baby, don't cry. This rings in my head all the time. And still. I tend to forget your words</segment4>
		<segment5>When I'm the swan in my full dive. Just one thing keeps me alive</segment5>
		<segment6>(Repeat Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>(Bridge:). And so it seems to me. To all of us here. The answer is clear. That you need a little less stress. And some more tenderness.</segment7>
		<segment8>(Repeat Chorus)    </segment8>
