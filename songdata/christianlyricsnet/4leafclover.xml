		<segment1>We've been on the outside looking in before. We've lived on the inside with a closed locked door. We've slept in the corners of the open floor</segment1>
		<segment2>We go round and round and round and round and round and round and round</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. There's no strength in a unicorn. No luck in a 4 Leaf Clover. There's no life unless it's born. And no death when it's over</segment3>
		<segment4>We've listened with open ears yet closed our minds. We've loved without any tears from our own eyes. We've gone to the parties in our cheap disguise</segment4>
		<segment5>We go round and round and round and round and round and round and round</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus]</segment6>
		<segment7>There's no strength in a unicorn. No luck in a 4 Leaf Clover. There's no life unless it's born. And no death when it's over</segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus]    </segment8>
