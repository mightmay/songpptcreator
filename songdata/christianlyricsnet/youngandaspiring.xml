		<segment1>So let's not even try you're right let's ball it up and. throw it out the window. It's becoming all so clear in my mind. I've thought this thing through like once or twice. I feel that this is my last request to you. Hold your breath. Bottle it up and save it for the next one. It's safe to say we've been riding this all night. None of this will ever change your mind. It's never safe to rely on borrowed time. Now we're both undone and it's time to open up. your eyes. Consequence, it's our need in times like these. Feelin' free is our modern disease. You're a classic disaster, with a knack for losing. your exterior. I'm so sick. From staring at the mirror. This all needs a break from you. And I'm used to this. I fear that I am just an end. So you'll play the mistaken and I'll play the. victim. In our screenplay of desire and I'm still writing. the letters I'll never send. Running in circles I can't forget how many times. I've played this in my mind. Feelin free, Feelin free. Consequence, it's our need in times like these. Feelin' free is our modern disease. You're a classic disaster, with a knack for losing. your exterior. I'm so sick. From staring at the mirror. This is my panic, This is my call to arms    </segment1>
