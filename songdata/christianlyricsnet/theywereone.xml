		<segment1>At first site, dreams fulfilled / You were love and love was the answer. A covenant, bound by words / A covenant bound by blood</segment1>
		<segment2>Your plague has ruined me / Made a mockery / Your tongue is the spear. Your plague has ruined me / Made a mockery / Your secret is no more</segment2>
		<segment3>A door was opened  the other was un-shut. My heart withering every secret. I have looked into the room / I have seen Judas</segment3>
		<segment4>A serpents day and they feasted / Your dream was eaten. Your heart has become a grave for robbers. Love turned to hate  justified by fate</segment4>
		<segment5>Your plague has ruined me / Made a mockery / Your tongue is the spear. Your plague has ruined me / Made a mockery / Your secret is no more</segment5>
		<segment6>A serpents day and they feasted / Your dream was eaten. I looked in the room  she was gone / The world has changed. My heart has remained</segment6>
		<segment7>A serpents day and they feasted / Your dream was eaten. Your heart has become a grave for robbers. Love turned to hate  justified by fate</segment7>
		<segment8>Your plague has ruined me / Made a mockery / Your tongue is the spear. Your plague has ruined me / Made a mockery / Your secret is no more    </segment8>
