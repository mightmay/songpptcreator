		<segment3>Cause everybody has to choose to sink or swim, win or lose. And everybody gets it right. Fight or flight. So will you decide </segment3>
		<segment4>So you bent the rules. Denied the truth and all the strong suggestions. You never heard your parents say. The giant misconception. Who could let you come this far who you are. You decide </segment4>
		<segment5>Cause' everybody has to choose sink or swim, win or lose. Know everybody gets it right. Fight or flight so will you decide </segment5>
		<segment6>Make sure it's up to you. Don't let the moment pass you by. All eyes on you. What you gonna do. Thoughts swirling through your head. You got to use your heart instead </segment6>
