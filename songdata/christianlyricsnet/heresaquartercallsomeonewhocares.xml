		<segment1>You say you were wrong to ever leave me alone. Now you're sorry, you're lonesome and scared. And you say you'd be happy if I you could just come back home. Well, here's a quarter, call someone who cares </segment1>
		<segment2>Call someone who'll listen, or might give a damn. Maybe one of your sordid affairs. But don't you come 'round here handin' me none of your lies. Here's a quarter, call someone who cares </segment2>
		<segment3>Girl, I thought what we had could never turn bad. So your leavin' caught me unaware. But the fact is you've run..girl, that can't be undone. So here's a quarter, call someone who cares </segment3>
		<segment4>Call someone who'll listen, or might give a damn. Maybe one of your sordid affairs. But don't you come 'round here handin' me none of your lies. Here's a quarter, call someone who cares </segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, here's a quarter, call someone who cares    </segment5>
