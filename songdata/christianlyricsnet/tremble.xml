		<segment1>shaking like a leaf. afraid to life my eyes. afraid of all your glory. ashamed of all my pride. then you call me in. to your holy place </segment1>
		<segment2>I fall down. down on my face. and I beckon you for mercy. and I beckon you to forgive everything that I've ever done. and I tremble. and I tremble </segment2>
		<segment3>I am just a man. showered in your grace. you're the holy god. your glory fills this place. and I beckon you for mercy. and I beckon you to forgive everything I've ever done. and I tremble. I tremble     </segment3>
