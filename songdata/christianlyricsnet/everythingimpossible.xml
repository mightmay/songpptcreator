		<segment1>I was taught to be practical in everything I do. Holding on to what is tangible, and then came You. That's when I found myself so far away, from everything I knew. I took a leap of faith</segment1>
		<segment2>Even though You're difficult for me to explain. I know I'll never be the same</segment2>
		<segment3>You're everything I cannot see. You're everything I cannot say. I know it all seems so illogical. But that's okay. You're the love You give to me. You're the love I give away. You are everything impossible. And that's okay</segment3>
		<segment4>That's okay!</segment4>
		<segment5>All the things that make no sense to me, draw me to You. Like finding freedom by surrendering, can it be true. With everything I can and cannot know. This mystery is bringing life to me</segment5>
		<segment6>And all this love I have for You I can't contain. I know I'll never be the same</segment6>
		<segment7>You're everything I cannot see. You're everything I cannot say. I know it all seems so illogical. But that's okay. You're the love You give to me. You're the love I give away. You are everything impossible. And that's okay</segment7>
		<segment8>That's okay</segment8>
		<segment9>What's so hard to understand. What I cannot comprehend. Is that You love me the way I am</segment9>
		<segment10>You're everything I cannot see. You're everything I cannot say. I know it all seems so illogical. But that's okay. You're the love You give to me. You're the love I give away. You are everything impossible. And that's okay</segment10>
		<segment11>You're everything I cannot see. You're everything I cannot say. I know it all seems so illogical. But that's okay. You're the love You give to me. You're the love I give away. You are everything impossible. And that's okay</segment11>
		<segment12>And that's okay    </segment12>
