		<segment1>Within my mind's eye. Flickering from the past. Come images that terrify and calm. A paradox in me</segment1>
		<segment2>Nail pierced hands they run with blood. A splitting brow forced by the thorns. His face is writhing with the pain yet it's comforting to me</segment2>
		<segment3>He chose to give it all. Jesus endured the pain. Paying a debt I owed and created a paradox in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Nail pierced hands they run with blood. A splitting brow forced by the thorns. His face is writhing with the pain yet it's comforting to me</segment4>
		<segment5>And in my heart I know that you're the only one. Who could of came and died, a sacrifice. As your God's only son</segment5>
		<segment6>Nail pierced hands they run with blood. A splitting brow forced by the thorns. His face is writhing with the pain yet it's comforting to me    </segment6>
