		<segment1>so many nights wasted poisoning myself. guess i just hated the emptiness i felt. to be excepted you gotta look like they do. but you held your hand out and took me just as I am. your loves like candy oh like something. ive never tasted before. and you take me places. i never dreamed i could go. oh ive been laughed at and broken in two. and ive felt the wrath that words of hate can do. oh ive been stranded and left standing in the rain. but you picked my head up and carried me away from this place. your loves like candy like something ive never tasted before. and you take me places i never dreamed i could go. and where would i be without you where would i go without you.     </segment1>
