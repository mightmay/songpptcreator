		<segment1>As I walked out one evening. To breathe the air and soothe my mind. I thought of friends and the home I had. And all those things I've left behind</segment1>
		<segment2>A silent star shone on me. My eyes saw a far horizon. As if to pierce this veil of time. And escape this earthly prison</segment2>
		<segment3>Will there come a time when the memories fade. And pass on with the long, long years. When the ties no longer bind. Lord save me from this darkest fear</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't let me come home a stranger. I couldn't stand to be a stranger. Lord save me from this darkest fear. Don't let me come home a stranger. I couldn't stand to be a stranger    </segment4>
