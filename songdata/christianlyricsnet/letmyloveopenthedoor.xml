		<segment1>When people keep repeating. That you'll never fall in love. When everybody keeps retreating. But you can't seem to get enough</segment1>
		<segment2>. Chorus. Let my love open the door. Let my love open the door. Let my love open the door. To your heart</segment2>
		<segment3>. When everything feels all over. When everybody seems unkind. I'll give you a four leaf clover. Take all the worry out of your mind</segment3>
		<segment4>. Repeat chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>. I have the only key to your heart. I can stop you falling apart. Try today, you'll find this way. Come one and give me a chance to say. Let my love open the door. It's all i'm living for. Release yourself from misery. Only thing's gonna set you free. That's my love</segment5>
		<segment6>. Repeat chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>. When tragedy befalls you. Don't let them bring you down. Love can cure your problems. You're so lucky i'm around</segment7>
		<segment8>. Repeat chorus    </segment8>
