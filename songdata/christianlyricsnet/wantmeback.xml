		<segment1>Do you want me back again. Cause i'm only doing time. Take me home again. Cause you're always on my mind</segment1>
		<segment2>The more I buy of life I find. The more I fall behind. As precious as the time may feel. It's always passing by</segment2>
		<segment3>Could you take me over there. If i leave my load behind. I can meet you anywhere. I'm not that hard to find</segment3>
		<segment4>The more I buy of life I find. The more I fall behind. As precious as the time may feel. It's always passing by. When I give all I have to you. Watch me start to fly</segment4>
		<segment5>If you want me. If you want me back again. I could leave this senseless. World behind me</segment5>
		<segment6>The more I buy of life I find. The more I fall behind. As precious as the time may feel. It's always passing by. When I give all I have to you. Watch me start to fly     </segment6>
