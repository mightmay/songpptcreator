		<segment1>Like a man on a wire. I balance between. A heart filled with desire. A head that knows everything. Somewhere out in the middle. You found me</segment1>
		<segment2>Ive got one foot in the clouds. One foot on the ground. You keep me steady somehow. Keep me from looking down. Somewhere out in the middle. You found me</segment2>
		<segment3>Falling into you. Is safe and sound. You open up my eyes. I see it now</segment3>
		<segment4>Youre my saving grace. Youre my saving grace. I run to my hiding place. My saving grace</segment4>
		<segment5>My life hangs on a string. But Im not afraid. I feel your love down below me. If it starts to break. Somewhere out in the open. You found me </segment5>
		<segment6>Falling into you. Is safe and sound. You open up my eyes. I see it now</segment6>
		<segment7>Youre my saving grace. Youre my saving grace. I run to my hiding place. My saving grace. My saving grace</segment7>
		<segment8>Carry me now. On your shoulder. I wont look down. Pull me closer</segment8>
		<segment9>Carry me now. On your shoulder. I wont look down. Pull me closer. Pull me closer</segment9>
		<segment10>Youre my saving grace. Youre my saving grace. I run to my hiding place. My saving grace. My saving grace    </segment10>
