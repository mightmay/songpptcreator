		<segment1>Another rainy Monday. Looks like Im gonna be late again. Why does the race Im runnin never seem to have an end. A day away from Sunday. Feels like Im already losing ground. Funny sometimes how quickly my emotions get turned around. Theyre letting me down</segment1>
		<segment2>I gotta keep my eyes on Jesus. Through the weak days. In a world where we really dont belong. Ive discovered if I keep my eyes on Jesus. Through the weak days. Then even on the weak days Hell make me strong</segment2>
		<segment3>The spirit is so willing. When the fellowship is so sweet. How soon all the good intentions. Find the flesh is weak. But theres a power waiting. With no limits to time or space. All of our doubts and fears disappear without a trace. When we look on His face</segment3>
		<segment4>I gotta keep my eyes on Jesus. Through the weak days. In a world where we really dont belong. Ive discovered if I keep my eyes on Jesus. Through the weak days. Then even on the weak days hell make me strong</segment4>
		<segment5>And when we keep our eyes on Jesus. Well gladly follow where He leads us</segment5>
		<segment6>I gotta keep my eyes on Jesus. Through the weak days. In a world where we really dont belong. Ive discovered if I keep my eyes on Jesus. Through the weak days. Then even on the weak days hell make me strong </segment6>
