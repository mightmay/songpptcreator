		<segment1>Hear my heart lord as I cry out to you. Hear my prayer lord and carry me thru. In your mercy in the promise you made. Be my strength lord when my strength fades away </segment1>
		<segment2>Cos when I am weak your strength is complete. It's perfect. Completely all I need. Sufficient for me. Your grace and peace are perfect. Completely all I need. You're all that I need </segment2>
		<segment3>In my weakness I'm finding your strength. In my sorrow a gentle embrace. Thru the seasons of laughter or pain. You are listening. When I call out your name </segment3>
		<segment4>I'll find you when I seek. I'll look for you with all of my heart. And I'll find you when I'm weak. Cos you are strong </segment4>
		<segment5>Hear my heart lord as I cry out to you. Hear my prayer lord and carry my thru. Carry me thru.     </segment5>
