		<segment1>I am what i am. i'm super fortified hundred proof girl with a band. and im a velveteen rabbit made of steel with a plan. im not your seventeen girl but it's worth not of can. of worms, im not your beauty queen. im not the girl in glamour magazine. im not running for miss popularity. coz i won't be what i can't be. [chorus] </segment1>
		<segment2>[chorus]. but i want to be real. i want to find out who i am. and i will find my way to hear. and i will find my voice my stand </segment2>
		<segment3>i am who i am. I am woman hear me roar and i am salt i am sand. a million starfish stranded, landed, i'll throw back what i can. i'll save the planet, change the world. i'll make a one girl stand. i've got better tings to do that be shown off. i won't be the doll you'll lock up in a box. dont expect me to be anything i'm not. coz i wont be what i can be. [chorus] </segment3>
		<segment4>approval is your sword. popularity your crown. but i'm not one of your subjects. you can't bring me down. you say i loose your approval if i'm not cool like you. well, here's a newsflash for you. i've got nothing to loose. your laughter is hollow because i don't care. you look down on me, but im not there. I've got nothing to prove and nothing to lose. nothing to prove and nothing to lose. [chorus].     </segment4>
