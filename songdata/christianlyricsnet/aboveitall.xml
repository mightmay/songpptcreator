		<segment1>Oh I'm waiting for the answer to the question in my soul. Lord why did you lead me here?. I take a look around and a desperate world surrounds me. I know I'm not of this place, but its here and in my face</segment1>
		<segment2>All that I am wants to run. God I feel hopeless and undone</segment2>
		<segment3>Lift me up above it all. I'm feeling broken and alone. Don't let me turn to stone. Lift my heart above it all. I've lost my hope tonight. And I'm praying for the strength to carry on. Lord lift me above it all</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I'm waiting for a glimpse of hope in an eye. But a flash of sunlight shows a faded gray. Cause these streets are hard and cold. And the alleys burn like coal with a stench of helplessness. And all the life that's been misspent</segment4>
		<segment5>And all that I am wants to run. God I feel helpless and undone</segment5>
		<segment6>Lift me up above it all. I'm feeling broken and alone. Don't let me turn to stone. Lift my heart above it all. I've lost my hope tonight. And I'm praying for the strength to carry on. Lord lift me above it all</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge: Maybe I'm not supposed to fly. Maybe you want me here tonight</segment7>
		<segment8>To lift them up above it all. When they're broken and alone. Don't let me turn to stone. Lift them up above it all. Cause they cannot stand alone. And they're praying for the strength to carry on</segment8>
		<segment9>Lift us up above it all. When we're broken and alone. Don't let us turn to stone. Lift us up above it all. Because we cannot stand alone. And we're praying for the strength to carry on. Lord will you lift us up above it all    </segment9>
