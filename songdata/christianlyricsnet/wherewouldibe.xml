		<segment1>You knew me. Even as a child I heard. You call me closer. Cleary like a song I've always known. You would play for me</segment1>
		<segment2>Like the breaking of the dawn. Everyday I long for more of You</segment2>
		<segment3>Where would I be without Your love. Where would I be without Your hand. On my life</segment3>
		<segment4>Lifted. Through the valleys. Through the pain. I know You're with me. Carried. Like I'm dancing in the rain. You cover me</segment4>
		<segment5>Then You catch me when I fall. As we walk this gift of Life. I need You</segment5>
		<segment6>Where would I be without Your love. Where would I be without Your hand. On my life</segment6>
		<segment7>Forever. I will follow You. I will live for You. Forever. I will worship You. I will follow You. Forever. I will live for You. I will worship You. Forever</segment7>
		<segment8>Will You dance with me again. For I can only live this life. With You</segment8>
		<segment9>Where would I be without Your love. Where would I be without Your hand. On my life</segment9>
		<segment10>Where would I be without Your grace. Where would I be without Your refuge. Over me.     </segment10>
