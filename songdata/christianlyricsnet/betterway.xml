		<segment1>I want change to happen!. I want Social justice!. I want Service! Programs!. No don't drink that wine.</segment1>
		<segment2>So many huge decisions. Are made in corporate board rooms. What about the streets of our city?</segment2>
		<segment3>Will we drink that wine? Will we trust those who know. Will we venture out in faith, Confess what we don't know. In a perfect world things are rarely what they seem. Reality could be a dream</segment3>
		<segment4>Who will we listen to and who will we trust. Will we trickle down or will we trickle up. Who will decide what the answers will be. What do we want? Rabbi we want to see</segment4>
		<segment5>My mustard seed will grow. It's growing into a mountain mover. My crippled leg is showing. But I'm going to the head of the table. My worst his best, most honored guest. The seed is growing stronger. Throw the mountains into the sea. Move the mountains inside of me</segment5>
		<segment6>The mustard seed against the world. Perfect world imperfect world</segment6>
		<segment7>I want &quot;Bottom Up&quot; justice. At the bottom of justice. Surely the wineskin of justice. Surely the cup of mercy. Will overflow into the streets of the world</segment7>
		<segment8>Soon will come the time. To drink of His new wine.     </segment8>
