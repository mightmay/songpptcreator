		<segment1>Chapter 1, here's my story. Probably not the one you wanna hear. My world was spinning round and round. Until my hopes they hit the ground. Feels like I've disappeared </segment1>
		<segment2>I kept it hidden in my secrets. My lies became a blur over time. I was just too blind to see. The truth was staring back at me. Love is not a controlling hand </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm giving up my secrets, I'm giving up my faults. Telling you I'm empty, should have know all along. It's taken me my whole life to realize I'm wrong. I'm giving up my secrets, I'm done holding on </segment3>
		<segment4>Staring backwards like a mirror. At someone I can barely see. The shadows of my past regrets, they disappear like silhouettes. The son has come, I wanna be free </segment4>
		<segment5>I'm giving up my secrets, I'm giving up my faults. Telling you I'm empty, should have know all along. It's taken me my whole life to realize I'm wrong. I'm giving up my secrets, I'm done holding on </segment5>
		<segment6>Done holding on    </segment6>
