		<segment1>Rolled out of bed on the right side. Looking up at the big blue sky. Oh yeah-oh yeah. Who I am is what I am. A piece in a part of a bigger plan. Oh yeah-oh yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>Breathe deep. Taste the moment. Few and far between</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. Days like these-they don't get any better. Let this be for always and forever. Every minute is so perfectly. Just the way that it was meant to be. Days like these-so graceful that I'm falling. On my knees and thanking God for all the. Little things that make me wanna say. How I wish I had a million days like these</segment3>
		<segment4>Life is running like a dream. I know I can do anything. Oh yeah-oh yeah. Days like this I could believe. The sun is shining just for me. Oh yeah-oh yeah</segment4>
		<segment5>Eyes closed. Touch the freedom. Never let it go</segment5>
		<segment6>[Repeat Chorus]</segment6>
		<segment7>It's as if I never knew that clouds existed. If there ever was a day to take a chance I'll risk it.     </segment7>
