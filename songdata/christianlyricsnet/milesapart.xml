		<segment1>Dig deep inside your mind I know I can't forget you. Reality and rawness I find, I know this is truth. Stripped of all my pretense I feel so lost and naked. With your tenderness for love I can make it. Confusion, fear consumes my thoughts the things I say and do. It's all difficult because I'm not with you. I know that I'm not growing, but sometimes I slip and now I;m slowing down. Please help me and please show me, so I can stop slipping and slowing down. Here we are sitting miles apart. Turn the page. Afraid to start.    </segment1>
