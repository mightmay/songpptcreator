		<segment1>Feel, fell the wounds. Hold my hands cradling all the souls. And wait, wait for peace. As my love makes it's way shattering</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). My heart it hurts. Cause it never catches it's breath. I'm still staying when I should have left. Come to where the waters meet the shore. i'll be there. And I will stay, leaving you</segment2>
		<segment3>(stay) Listen to. All my dreams, love that lasts, pain that heals. And take, take your time. But move so fast, cause hearts move on. And this is real</segment3>
		<segment4>This time it means something. Dreams will fall, love will spill    </segment4>
