		<segment1>so pure to me 'cause. sometimes i want to runaway but i'll stay 'cause. your love is so pure to me. and i try to tell but they just won't listen 'cause. some people run away. sky oh LORD is so pure to me</segment1>
		<segment2>and there's times times. when the pain hurts so much. and as i begin to close my eyes. i begin to fade away from this GOD forsaken world. some people run away. sky oh LORD is so pure to me    </segment2>
