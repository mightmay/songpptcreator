		<segment1>I CAN HEAR A GENTLE RUSTLE AS THE CURTAINS MOVE ABOUT. BUT THE STRAIN AND DAILY HUSTLE TEND TO DROWN YOU OUT. I CANNOT SEE YOUR PRESENCE BUT I KNOW WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN. AND I LONG TO BE A FEATHER AT THE MERCY OF THE WIND</segment1>
		<segment2>I CANNOT REALLY HOLD YOU BUT I FEEL YOU IN MY LIFE. OH HOW I LONG TO SEE YOU BUT YOURE SOMEWHERE OUT OF SIGHT. OH I KNOW THAT I AM BLIND BUT WHERE IM GOING IN THE END. YOULL OPEN UP MY EYES SO I CAN SEE THE WIND</segment2>
		<segment3>AND WHEN I HEAR THE THUNDER I KNOW THAT YOU DRAW NEAR. AND THEN ILL WATCH IN WONDER AS THE EVIDENCE APPEARS. WAVES GROWN MIGHTY AT YOUR BIDDING TREES BOW THEIR BRANCHES LOW. ONLY TRUTH REMAINS UNDAUNTED IN THE POWER YOU CAN SHOW</segment3>
		<segment4>IT SCATTERS SEEDS WHERE THE FARMERS HAVE NOT SOWN. AND IT UTTERS PRAYERS IN A LANGUAGE YET UNKNOWN. NO ONE KNOWS QUITE WHERE YOURE GOING BUT WE SEE WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN. AND WHEN I GET WHERE IM GOING THATS WHEN ILL SEE THE WIND    </segment4>
