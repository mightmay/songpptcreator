		<segment1>Do you remember when. You were way back then. You held the world inside your hands. When you told me love was the strongest stuff. Your strength was innocence </segment1>
		<segment2>But, oh man. The signs of the times are omens. You're starting the day in no man's land again </segment2>
		<segment3>Who are you gonna be?. When you're on your knees, who do you believe?. Oh oh oh. Fear is a lonely man. You've been given innocence, you've been given innocence again </segment3>
		<segment4>You should know by now. That the darkest hour. Is when your broken heart goes down. It's a bitter end when the sweet begins. Grace is sufficiency </segment4>
		<segment5>But, oh dear, we'll never deserve it. No dear, we never could earn it. Now, here, the choice is yours </segment5>
		<segment6>Who are you gonna be?. When you're on your knees, who do you believe?. Oh oh oh. Fear is a lonely man. You've been given innocence, you've been given innocence again </segment6>
		<segment7>Grace is high and low. Grace is high and low. Grace is high and low. We'll never be the same </segment7>
		<segment8>Who are you gonna be?. When you're on your knees, who do you believe?. Oh oh oh. Fear is a lonely man. You've been given innocence, you've been given innocence again    </segment8>
