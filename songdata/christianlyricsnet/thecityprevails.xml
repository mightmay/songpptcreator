		<segment1>For all the spires this city raised. You'd think this is a holy place. The shadow of a cross descends. But it's swallowed by the haze. You never sleep do you?. Always pouring smoke into. The atmosphere. What happens here stays with us till the grave</segment1>
		<segment2>Wisdom cries out in the streets (Proverbs 1:20)</segment2>
		<segment3>But the sirens are singing us to sleep. They're so loud that I can't think. I hear voices but I just can't tell. And when we're dead, the city prevails</segment3>
		<segment4>Countless walk the open streets. With shackles chained around their feet. Wisdom says to fly away. But they cannot see their wings. Water, water everywhere. But not a drop that I would dare. Drink and so we think we'll go. Imbibe the filthy air</segment4>
		<segment5>Wisdom cries out in the streets</segment5>
		<segment6>But the sirens are singing us to sleep. They're so loud that I can't think. I hear voices but I just can't tell. And when we're dead, the city prevails</segment6>
		<segment7>Don't be silent, God. Don't be silent. Please, don't be silent (Psalm 83:1)</segment7>
		<segment8>Or I will fall into the world. I will fall into the world. Don't be silent. Please, God, don't be silent. Don't be silent. Please, God, don't be silent. Or I will fall into the world. Or I will fall into the world    </segment8>
