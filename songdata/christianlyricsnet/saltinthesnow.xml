		<segment1>Give me wings, Give me peace. These are the things that I need. I'm tormented, broken and shamed. Are you listening? (Are you listening)?. Give me shelter from the storm, I know it's a lot to ask for, Considering how recent I've piled the dirt on your name. Are you listening? (Are you listening)?. Are you listening?</segment1>
		<segment2>I have heard that winter's cold. will give way to summer's warmth. Oh no! Like salt in the snow. I'm melted and left all alone on the side of the road.</segment2>
		<segment3>In this where I am for your sake, Stuck between sleep and awake?. My mind is dreaming of things. Are you listening? (Are you listening)?. I took you for granted again. And threw you aside. And pretended for one minute that I had control of my life, And direction it seemed to be in. I was wrong again, (I was wrong again), are you listening?</segment3>
		<segment4>I have heard that winter's cold. will give way to summer's warmth. Oh no! Like salt in the snow. I'm melted and left all alone on the side of the road.</segment4>
		<segment5>I will wait for you to come again, And I can't pretend like I'm confident. And I can't pretend like it makes much sense when it doesn't.</segment5>
		<segment6>I have heard that winter's cold, Will give way to summer's warmth. Oh no! Like salt in the snow, I'm melted and left all alone on the side of the road. On the side of the road. On the side of the road. On the side of the road.    </segment6>
