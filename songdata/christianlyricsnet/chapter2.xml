		<segment1>New day springs light on the burdened, the downcast. My past lingers to define the outcast. I long for the coming of chapter two. To put an end to this cycle of backlash. So I start where the last chapter ended. But the veil has been lifted, my thoughts are sifted. Every wrong is righted. The new song I sing with every breath, breathes sight in</segment1>
		<segment2>So let your face consume my mind, right</segment2>
		<segment3>Hair standing on end, it's sent forth. Is this the end I was always meant for?. I still long for the taste of better days long ago. Long past, so dead to me but yet. Here it is in the palm of my hand to see. As I witness the birth of a new beginning. I sense it breathing, I feel it seething. I see my fear begin fading</segment3>
		<segment4>Breath on me for my new beginning    </segment4>
