		<segment1>If you're sitting down on your feet. Let's wake up those who are asleep. March on, left to right to left again. Our feet in sync to this rhythym. Conducted by the hand of the saving One. Report, fall in line, big mission with little time</segment1>
		<segment2>Salute, stand tall, with one voice answers the call</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Hear us say Jesus. Where are we while the world caves in?. Are we showing love or hate, are we enemy or friend. What was black and white has now turned grey. Let's right this wrong with love today. Stand our ground but with a helping hand</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>So sing it out now, with one voice loud and clear sing. Hallelujah, for our Redemption's near</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>It's time for us to stand up and speak the truth of His love. It's time to let the world know we've got something to say. It's time for us to lift our hands until the world understands Jesus. the reigning King is alive and well today.</segment7>
