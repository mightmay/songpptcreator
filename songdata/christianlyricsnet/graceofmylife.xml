		<segment1>I lie awake so often at night. With something to read or something to write. In the silence my mind is free. To think of the ways that God has blessed me</segment1>
		<segment2>It's easy to see how He's been so kind. Any proof I might need is right here by my side</segment2>
		<segment3>You are the grace of my life. So tender, so undeserved. Hard to believe you're my wife. Even harder to put what I feel into words. If I need evidence God is good. Just looking at you is enough. You are the grace of my life. For you grace my life with your love</segment3>
		<segment4>Love that is pure, so faithful and strong. You forgive me when I do you wrong. I've seen in you time after time. A picture on earth of love so divine</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, I am amazed for how can it be. That someone like you would love someone like me</segment5>
		<segment6>You are the grace of my life. So tender, so undeserved. Hard to believe you're my wife. Even harder to put what I feel into words. If I need evidence God is good. Just looking at you is enough. You are the grace of my life. For you grace my life with your love     </segment6>
