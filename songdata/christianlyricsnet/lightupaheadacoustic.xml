		<segment1>take this heart of darkness. i give it all. and all the emptiness. i feel it all. the times that i feel nothing. you bring me love. and so i can live for something. you lift me up </segment1>
		<segment2>and all these bad dreams. i wake up to the light. and when i cant see. i wake up to your eyes. wake me up </segment2>
		<segment3>there's the light up ahead. there's the light up ahead (yeah). there's the light up ahead. there's the light up ahead </segment3>
		<segment4>it gets so complicated. to live a lie. turn in to what you hated. you're breaking up. the times i feel like nothing. you bring enough. so i can live for something. you lift me up </segment4>
		<segment5>and all these bad dreams. i wake up to the light. and when i can't see. i wake up to your eyes. wake me up </segment5>
		<segment6>there's the light up ahead. there's the light up ahead (yeah). there's the light up ahead. there's the light up ahead.     </segment6>
