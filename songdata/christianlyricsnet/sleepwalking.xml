		<segment1>Words so secure screaming like an alarm. Are you trying to wake me up. Now what was that you were trying to pull. Is it my arm. I do believe you're trying to wake me up </segment1>
		<segment2>(2x). But could it be maybe. It's not me sleeping. Could it be maybe you awakening</segment2>
		<segment3>Sleep this time tonight. Sleepwalk in the light. Sleep this time tonight (one day we'll). Sleepwalk out of sight </segment3>
		<segment4>Now here I am, but I'm just sleepwalking. Yes here I stand. But I guess I'm just sleeptalking for myself </segment4>
		<segment5>But could it be maybe. It's not me sleeping. Could it be maybe you awakening </segment5>
		<segment6>Sleep this time tonight. Sleepwalk in the light. Sleep this time tonight (one day we'll). Sleepwalk out of sight </segment6>
		<segment7>One day this world will see me at the horizon. One day from a distant light. And just before I stand to face my love. I'll turn around. And with a smile I'll say my goodbyes. Just one last goodbye. Goodbye.     </segment7>
