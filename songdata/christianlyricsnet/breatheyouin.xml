		<segment1>Taking hold, breaking in. The pressures on, need to circulate. Mesmerized and taken in. Moving slow, so it reasonates. It's time to rest, not to sleep away. My thoughts alone, try to complicate. I'll do my best, to seek you out. And be myself, not impersonate</segment1>
		<segment2>Tried so hard to not walk away. And when things don't go my way. I'll still carry on and on just the same</segment2>
		<segment3>I've always been strong. But can't make this happen. 'Cause I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in. The fear of becoming. I'm so tired of running. And I need to breathe, I want to breathe you in. I want to breathe you in</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm going in, so cover me. Your compass will, help me turn the page. The laughing stock I'll never be. Because I won't let them take me</segment4>
		<segment5>Took awhile to see all the love that's around me. Through the highs and lows there's a truth that I've known. And it's You    </segment5>
