		<segment1>When I walked in to the room. I wasn't thinking anything but. Maybe I would rent a flick that a guy would. As I'm talking to myself I saw her. Reach for the top shelf right farther. Faded black then I knew it was over </segment1>
		<segment2>I fall apart 'cuz you've got a late charge on my heart. If it's alright with you we'll meet in the previously viewed. Sometimes I try to play you in my mind. But who am I kidding you. I won't forget that time in the video store </segment2>
		<segment3>(Oh Oh Oh.. that time in the video store, Oh Oh..) </segment3>
		<segment4>Now here we are in the second verse. lookin' worst than the first. Don't wanna end up like my man Fred Durst 'cuz he did it all for the nookie. When she looked up I thought I must be dreamin'. She had the eyes of an angel even think I mighta saw wings I'm leavin' </segment4>
		<segment5>I fall apart 'cuz you've got a late charge on my heart. If it's alright with you we'll meet in the previously viewed. Sometimes I try to play you in my mind. But who am I kidding you. I won't forget that time in the video store </segment5>
		<segment6>(Oh Oh Oh.. that time in the video store, Oh Oh Oh..) </segment6>
		<segment7>Every time I think I see you. I won't forget that nobod-y else could. Ever do what you did to me on that night. I saw you there so unexpected. I could care less who else was there. I've been infected. .aww. so infeected by you.     </segment7>
