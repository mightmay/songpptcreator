		<segment1>I heard a voice through the discord. A deluge of passersby. I saw one gaze frozen in time. Watching me passing by</segment1>
		<segment2>I swear I'll know your face in the crowd. And I'll hear your voice so loud. When you're whispering</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey unfaithful I will teach you. To be stronger. Hey ungraceful I will teach you. To forgive one another</segment3>
		<segment4>Here's my kiss to betray. Desperate to brush the lips of grace. Do you feel hollow when you think of how I lied?</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh sweet angel of mercy. With your grace like the morning. Wrap your loving arms around me. Oh sweet angel of mercy. With your grace like the morning. Wrap your loving arms around me</segment5>
		<segment6>Hey unfaithful I will teach you. To be stronger. Hey ungraceful I will teach you. To forgive one another</segment6>
		<segment7>Hey unfaithful I will teach you. To be stronger. Hey unloving. I will love you. And will love you</segment7>
		<segment8>Jesus I'm ready to come home. I'm ready to come. Jesus I'm ready to come home. Unfaithful. Ungraceful. And unloving. I will love you    </segment8>
