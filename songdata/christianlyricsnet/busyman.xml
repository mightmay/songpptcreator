		<segment1>I know a man named Billy. He's got almost everything. Three stories, two cars, one swimming pool. And some broken parts of an empty heart. And I'm thinkin'..</segment1>
		<segment2>Billy, Billy, Billy, you're a very busy man. But you're running with your eyes closed. You could be missing life all along the way. And you'd never even know it. You're a busy man, Billy, Billy, you're a busy man. Just too busy man</segment2>
		<segment3>You've got a lot of nice things there, Billy. But they've cost you more than you know. 'Cause what is really worth, can you tell me. If you're gaining the world, but you're losing your soul. And I'm thinkin'..</segment3>
		<segment4>Billy, Billy, Billy, you're a very busy man. But you're running with your eyes closed. Looks like you traded life for the things you have. Not the thing you really wanted. You're a busy man Billy, Billy, you're a very busy man. Just too busy man</segment4>
		<segment5>So when the day is over. And the lights go out. Do you ever stop and wonder, Wonder what it's all about. Wonder what it's all about. Wonder what it's all about. Hey, Billy, do you ever wonder. What it's all about?</segment5>
		<segment6>Billy, Billy, Billy, you're a very busy man. But you're running with your eyes closed. You could be missing life all along the way. And you'd never even know it. You're a busy man, Billy, Billy, you're a busy man. Just too busy man</segment6>
		<segment7>Slow down, busy man, take a look around you. When it's all said and done tell me what's it gonna come to </segment7>
