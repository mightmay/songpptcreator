		<segment1>Or you could be one more chance for hope</segment1>
		<segment2>When I think of what could be. If we let our hearts believe. That it takes just one. Just one could turn this all around</segment2>
		<segment3>And if we're living history. How will they think of you and me. If it takes just one, just one. What if, what if, what if I'm the one?</segment3>
		<segment4>I see a nation without any walls. A beautiful haven for one and for all. I see a day when people are free. When shackles are broken and fall to the street</segment4>
		<segment5>A voice, a cry, call out from on high. The first one of many, go lay down your life</segment5>
		<segment6>When I think of what could be. If we let our hearts believe. That it takes just one. Just one could turn this all around</segment6>
		<segment7>And if we're living history. How will they think of you and me. If it takes just one, just one. What if, what if, what if I'm the one?</segment7>
		<segment8>It takes one, takes one, one. (What if you're the one). It takes one, takes one, one. It takes one, takes one. (What if I'm the one)</segment8>
		<segment9>It takes one, takes one, one. (What if you're the one). It takes one, takes one, one. It takes one, takes one    </segment9>
