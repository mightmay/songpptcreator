		<segment1>(come what may day to day. I know that he will make a way. Put it in god's hands)</segment1>
		<segment2>I've done all i can to please you. But i can't wipe away that frown. I'm letting go, that's how much i love you. It's in god's hands now. I gave you my heart forever. And i will keep that solemn vow. But i can't put us back together. It's in god's hands now</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Lord knows i cried and cried. Cause i don't want to lose you. I tried, yes, i tried. But if i'm not the one who moves you. I won't hold you down</segment3>
		<segment4>My head is in a cloud of sorrow. But my feet are on the ground. There's hope for us as long as there's tomorrow. It's in god's hands now</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus    </segment5>
