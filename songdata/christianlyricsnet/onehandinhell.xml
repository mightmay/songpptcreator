		<segment1>One hand in hell. One eye in the fire. Heal me for I have sinned. And I get what I deserve</segment1>
		<segment2>Sick of hearing my cries. Same thing over and over. Making promises that I break. At the first sign of things going my way</segment2>
		<segment3>How quickly I forget (I forget). My moments of despair</segment3>
		<segment4>One hand in hell. One eye in the fire. Heal me for I have sinned. And I get what I deserve</segment4>
		<segment5>I am the fool. That ruins what we've got. I am the backbone. Of modern thought</segment5>
		<segment6>One hand in hell. One eye in the fire. Heal me for I have sinned. And I get what I deserve</segment6>
		<segment7>Let that hand burn</segment7>
		<segment8>I get what I deserve. Let that hand burn (4x).     </segment8>
