		<segment1>Maybe this time, no next time, We'll get our laps/laughs? right, we'll get it right. Will we just do what feels good, And then we know it could cause our souls to drown.</segment1>
		<segment2>In all the distractions of our lives.</segment2>
		<segment3>What does it mean to be, From the light in a world that's speechless, From the light in a world of darkness.</segment3>
		<segment4>What does it mean to be, From the light in a world that's speechless, From the light in a world of darkness.</segment4>
		<segment5>Insecurities are breeding inside me, And they won't let you go to song, But they won't last against the sword's edge, The blade, the blade cuts right through wrong.</segment5>
		<segment6>All the distractions of our lives.</segment6>
		<segment7>What does it mean to be, From the light in a world that's speechless, From the light in a world of darkness.</segment7>
		<segment8>What does it mean to be, From the light in a world that's speechless, From the light in a world of darkness.</segment8>
		<segment9>I wanna know, I need to know, I want to know. (What does it really mean to be?)</segment9>
		<segment10>I wanna know, I need to know, I want to know. (What does it really mean to be?)</segment10>
		<segment11>What does it mean to be, From the light in a world that's speechless, From the light in a world of darkness.</segment11>
		<segment12>What does it mean to be, From the light in a world that's speechless, From the light in a world of darkness.    </segment12>
