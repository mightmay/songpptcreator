		<segment1>There's an air everywhere. Of inconsideration and despair. I don't consider you. And you don't consider me. And it's well understood. We don't care </segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). You know we don't have to wait until the end of the night. Just to say that something's wrong and maybe nobody's right. We're all victims in a battle. We never had to fight. It's ok, it's alright. Steady now. we're in this thing together. We're in this together </segment2>
		<segment3>I regret that I forget. Confessions always seem to stay unsaid. And maybe I worry that you'll forsake me. Use my shame as a weapon. And go on and break me </segment3>
		<segment4>Cause I want to take the time to say. I'm sorry I haven't loved you the way I should. Do you think that you could forgive me. Just try to hear me. I need you with me now.     </segment4>
