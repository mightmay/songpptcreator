		<segment1>My Words Feel So Empty. My Lips Speak In Vain. Your Face Tells A Story. Of Wounds That Still Remain. Stay True To My Heart. Cast Failures To The Wind. I Hate The Way It Feels. To Know I Slipped Again </segment1>
		<segment2>Tomorrow Holds Another Chance. Not Just To Smile But Make It Real. For What It's Worth I Won't Give Up. For Whats It's Worth I Won't Give Up </segment2>
		<segment3>I Won't Walk Away. For What It's Worth I Won't Give Up [x3].     </segment3>
