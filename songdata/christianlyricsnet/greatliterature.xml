		<segment1>It's all in the way that I see things that you don't. It's all in me having a point of view that you can't. Touch or destruct, delay or confront. Understand or construct</segment1>
		<segment2>If I gave you answers, you'd shove them right back in my face. What is real? Face up to the consequence of. What will become, your thoughts become numb. I can't wish you there, could I make you care?    </segment2>
