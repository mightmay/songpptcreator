		<segment1>Your hands didnt move. well neither did mine. New Years will bring. so much to say. but nothing comes out right. both of us left without words&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.testimania.com/&quot;&gt;Testi Canzoni&lt;/a&gt;. both of us lost in this world. it's softer than ever before. </segment1>
		<segment2>And you were the outline. of everything you would become. The keeper of these hands. To hold you now. it is a far cry more than anything that I deserve. </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring. I'd give you my life. cause I don't own anything. It seemed like the bottom was all that I had until now. I'd give you my life. if you'd give me yours somehow. </segment3>
		<segment4>Your hands didn't move. well neither did mine. New Years will bring me to you. I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring. I'd give you my life. cause I don't own anything. It seemed like the bottle was all that I had until now. I'd give you my life. if you'd give me yours somehow.     </segment4>
