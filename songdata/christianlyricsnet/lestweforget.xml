		<segment1>Grown up, now it's my turn. Dare me to make my move. Nowhere to go. And I still don't know. But I'll make it through. Times change, change like the wind. I'm blown away again. Goodbye to my friends. New life begins. Without you. These were the days the choices we make. Decide who we will be. And where we go. As we say goodbye. The look in your eye is screaming silently. Remember to never forget. Move on, watching you live. Dying to be like you. I'd go back in time. But I can't press rewind. Sad but true. Broke down, I'll be okay. I'm gonna make it through. I won't be afraid. Starting today. Without you. Don't you ever forget    </segment1>
