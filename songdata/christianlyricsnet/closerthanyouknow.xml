		<segment1>Do you remember. Do you remember when you said. It wouldn't be long. Till you'd be back again. Well I've been waiting. Would you come around. Don't turn your back on my love now. You've been running for a long long time. Searching for a life you just can't seem to find. You know there's a better way. Seems there's trouble everywhere you go. I am right here waiting closer than you know. So don't go throwing it all away. I'm closer than you know. I know you're out there. I know you're not too far from me. Can you hear me calling?. I'm waiting patiently. It's been awhile now. Would you come back home?. Aren't you tired going it alone?. You've been running for a long long time. Searching for a life you just can't seem to find. You know there's a better way. Seems there's trouble everywhere you go. I am right here waiting closer than you know. So don't go throwing it all away. I'm closer than you know. You know I love you. You know I care. You know I'm waiting to see you again. But in the darkness. How can you see. The love I'd give you is all that you need. You've been running for a long long time. Searching for a life you just can't seem to find. You know there's a better way. Seems there's trouble everywhere you go. I am right here waiting closer than you know. So don't go throwing it all away. I'm closer than you know    </segment1>
