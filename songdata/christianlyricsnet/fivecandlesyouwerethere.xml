		<segment1>A promise or a dare. I would jump if I knew you'd catch me. Staring over the edge. I can't tell if you'll be here for me </segment1>
		<segment2>I close my eyes and make a wish. Turn out the lights and take a breath. Pray that when the wick is burned. You would say that it's all about love </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: You were there when I needed you. You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open. You were there when I needed you. You were there when the skies broke wide, wide open </segment3>
		<segment4>You were never here </segment4>
		<segment5>I remember you said. Love was more than your good intentions. Empty boxes on the floor. Things I never asked you for. I pray that when the wick is burned. You would say that it's all about love </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>I can't see the promise of. Excuses you fall upon. I pray to God not holding on. To things you've left undone </segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus x 2] </segment8>
		<segment9>You were there when I. You were there when I. You were there when I needed you    </segment9>
