		<segment1>Well the moon moved past Nebraska. And spilled laughter on them cold Dakota Hills. And angels danced on Jacob's stairs. Yeah, they danced on Jacob's stairs. There is this silence in the Badlands. And over Kansas the whole universe was stilled. By the whisper of a prayer. The whisper of a prayer</segment1>
		<segment2>And the single hawk bursts into flight. And in the east the whole horizon is in flames. I feel thunder in the sky. I see the sky about to rain. And I hear the prairies calling out Your name</segment2>
		<segment3>I can feel the earth tremble. Beneath the rumbling of the buffalo hooves. And the fury in the pheasant's wings. And there's fury in a pheasant's wings. It tells me the Lord is in His temple. And there is still a faith. That can make the mountains move. And a love that can make the heavens ring. And I've seen love make heaven ring</segment3>
		<segment4>Where the sacred rivers meet. Beneath the shadow of the Keeper of the plains. I feel thunder in the sky. I see the sky about to rain. And I hear the prairies calling out Your name</segment4>
		<segment5>From the place where morning gathers. You can look sometimes forever 'til you see. What time may never know. What time may never know. How the Lord takes by its corners this old world. And shakes us forward and shakes us free. To run wild with the hope. To run wild with the hope</segment5>
		<segment6>The hope that this thirst will not last long. That it will soon drown in the song. Not sung in vain. And I feel thunder in the sky. I see the sky about to rain. And I hear the prairies calling out Your name    </segment6>
