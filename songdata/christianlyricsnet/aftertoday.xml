		<segment1>After today I'll get me out of this place. Into the world so I can set a new pace. Seems I'm on my own from here. Vision doesn't seem so clear. Won't You lay me in Your hands of grace </segment1>
		<segment2>I've got a funny feeling that I'm gonna go away. Gonna face my future, gonna try to make the grade. I've got a ways to go from here and vision doesn't seem so clear. But praise God He's got a plan and understanding isn't my place </segment2>
		<segment3>After today I'm gonna come face to face. With a new world who knows I'm feeling this way. I've got a ways to go from here. I'm gonna overcome these fears. Still I'm gonna need Your hands of grace </segment3>
		<segment4>I'll be a bigger man.. I'll pray a bigger prayer.. I'll dream a bigger dream..for today.    </segment4>
