		<segment1>If I could only fly. I'd go up and look down from the sky. So I could see the bigger picture. And Lord if I could sit with You. At Your feet for an a hour or two. I'm sure I'd ask too many questions. 'Cause there's so much going on down here. That I must confess I just don't understand</segment1>
		<segment2>But I have prayed. At Your feet my whole life has been laid. So I won't worry, I won't be afraid. 'Cause my soul is resting on Your higher ways. Let the road ahead become unclear. I am Yours so what have I to fear. If my soul is resting on Your higher ways</segment2>
		<segment3>Your higher ways, teach me to trust You. Your higher ways are not like mine. Your higher ways are the ways of a Father. Hiding His children in His love</segment3>
		<segment4>So let it rain. And if my eyes grow dim with tears of pain. This hope I have will not be washed away. 'Cause my soul is resting on Your higher ways</segment4>
		<segment5>Someday I will fly. Maybe then You will take me aside. And show me the bigger picture. But until I'm with You. I'll be here with a heart that is true. And a soul that is resting on Your higher ways </segment5>
