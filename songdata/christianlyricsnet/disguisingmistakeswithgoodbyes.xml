		<segment1>just take it back (I feel). they're only words (your hair). we hold the tethers (through my). we're here together (fingers). we paint the night (every). only to find (silk stand). it's cracked and peeling (takes my). each face revealing (breath a-). what we don't say (-way)</segment1>
		<segment2>let's take these lines and draw ourselves out of here. this shipwreck from set-sail. we'll map the stars. tonight they help to find a way. when all is said. words can breathe more life than death</segment2>
		<segment3>the innocence that people share. when touching on secrets and letting down hair</segment3>
		<segment4>over and over let's not forget last time. I've kept the best parts and play them in my mind. this is tomorrow so take it or leave it</segment4>
		<segment5>empty diaries. we have nothing to say. and we'll take the right steps to keep these pages clean. you want the answers and I see them on your face. you need to know this is where the promise breaks</segment5>
		<segment6>I can give you my answer</segment6>
		<segment7>i know (i know). if you stay (if you stay). this will be (this will). ours to take (be ours to take)</segment7>
		<segment8>inside i (i feel). am overwhelmed (so good). from holding back (i want). but know that this won't be forever (you for all my days, but tonight..)</segment8>
		<segment9>i can't stay here. you can't ask me. just so you would know    </segment9>
