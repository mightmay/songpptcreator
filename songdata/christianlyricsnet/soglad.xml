		<segment1>I want to jump - I'm so scared. I want to swim - don't want to get wet. How do I get to You - what do I have to do?. I want to pray - I need sleep. Don't want to sow, I just want to reap. I know what You're going to say: there's something in the way. Will it ever end, this war inside me?</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm just so glad. That when I can't, You can. And where I end. That's where You begin</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to sing from my soul. I'm getting bored with rock 'n roll. All my childhood dreams, nothing but childish fantasies. Here I come - there I go. Maybe yes, possibly no. The Good Fight's a brawl - the winner gets it all. Bring it to and end, this war inside me</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm just so glad. That when I can't, You can. And where I end. That's where You begin</segment4>
		<segment5>Today hot, tomorrow cold. It's the oldest story that's ever been told. How do I get to You0 what do I have to do?. One day You'll end this war inside me</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm just so glad. That when I can't, You can. And where I end. That's where You begin    </segment6>
