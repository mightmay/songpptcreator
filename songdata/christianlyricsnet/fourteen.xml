		<segment1>The sun goes down and then she slips away. It gets so lonely after dark. If only we could relive yesterday. Tomorrow always seems so far</segment1>
		<segment2>The end is near so much is left to say. The world is getting old tonight. Traumatized, people are so afraid. I smile cause everything's alright     </segment2>
