		<segment1>Subvert the conscious mind of us all. Become the one who is the fraud. Deny the evil that pervades. Deny the sin that fuels the way</segment1>
		<segment2>Pull down the blinders, rip down the shades. See the world as it has been made. The laws of life point the way. The ordering of every thing</segment2>
		<segment3>Deny the conscience of righteousness. Paint broad strokes of piousness. Everyone believes in something, everyone believes. Just because you dont call it God does not mean beliefs not involved. Just because you dont call it God does not mean beliefs not involved</segment3>
		<segment4>Random - Organized lie. Random - Organized lie</segment4>
		<segment5>Pull down the blinders, rip down the shades. See the world as it has been made. The laws of life point the way. The ordering of every thing</segment5>
		<segment6>Random - Organized lie. Random - Organized lie    </segment6>
