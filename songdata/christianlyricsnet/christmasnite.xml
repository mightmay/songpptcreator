		<segment1>I took a walk around the world to see Your promised sign. I left my buddies laughin' somewhere in the sand behind. I watch the world glow to the dark light of the moon. I see another light in view. I walk the world but to a star's light not the moon. After all I knew it had to be something to do with You. I really don't mind not havin' my old friends. As long as You'll meet me in Bethlehem. If I'm a crazy man, well, You still called me through the sand. If I'm a wise man, well, then You prepared the gold in my hand. I'll keep Your light in sight, with my search for You, it's like. Christmas night. You called me strongly from the East. But still, Lord Jesus, I'm no king. You took this planet by surprise whenever You came down. You stunned all them in Bethlehem. I caught Your beacon to these men. I picked it up and took my map and started out. If I'm a crazy man, well, You still called me through the sand. If I'm a wise man, well, then You prepared the gold in my hand. I'll keep Your light in sight, with my search for You, it's like. Christmas night. Yeah!. If I'm a crazy man, well, You still called me through the sand. If I'm a wise man, well, then You prepared the gold in my hand. I'll keep Your light in sight, with my search for You, it's like. Christmas night</segment1>
