		<segment1>Your life is like a castle built upon the sand. All the work is done but it will not stand. Your life is like a picture without any paint. It's left you feeling blank and a little incomplete. From the answers that you seek. All the questions that you have all lie in Him</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>He is the way the truth and the life. He's my road to take me home. He is the way the truth and the life. He's my father and my friend</segment3>
		<segment4>Life is overwhelming when you start to doubt. Have faith He is with you here and now. So many questions you have asked along your way. Like who I am where I came from where will I go. When I leave here from this world. I have faith that heaven is within my reach    </segment4>
