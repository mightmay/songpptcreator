		<segment1>I hear you prayin'. Your dreams would be takin' you far from here. (far away). So tired of waiting. Your heart must be breaking in two. While you do. With all the things in the world that you're trying to do. Does what I'm trying to say. get thru. to you. Chorus. Wish that I could read your mind. Understand what you hide in your heart. Then maybe, baby, I could help you see how loved you are. Wish that I could find the words. That would echo inside of your soul. 'Cause then, my friend, you'd know. He loves you so. God loves you so. I have a confession. For all your hard questions. The answers may not seem clear. There's no use pretending. 'Cause we're all out here spinning our wheels so it feels. Only one knows your heart. what you hope to become. Do you know who you're running from or to. Chorus. My love is strong but not strong enough. I'll give you all that I have. it wouldn't matter that much. So instead of promises. I'll just be honest. 'Cause I won't always be around. And I know my love will let you down </segment1>
