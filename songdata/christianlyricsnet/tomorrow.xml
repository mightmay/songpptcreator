		<segment1>Complacency can kill as a liar and a thief. whisp'ring thoughts of nagging. Tomorrow's just beyond my reach. It's ever always subtleties seem harmless for the moment. It's venom is most bitter every time I give in. Complacency is danger in its purest form. It talks me into things to which I would otherwise conform. Given my ability to give in to the easy way. No wonder why my spirit hates my flesh</segment1>
		<segment2>Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today. But when tomorrow comes I still don't wanna change. Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder. With a life of sure uncertainty. Tomorrow may not ever even be</segment2>
		<segment3>How can I combat a complacent state of mind. I need a constant reminder of the wrong and wasted time. I need to train my heart in ways of seeing heaven as my home. I need to take the power given as my own</segment3>
		<segment4>Tomorrow is much easier to deal with than today. But when tomorrow comes I still don't wanna change. Why am I willing to replace a wealth of wonder. With a life of sure uncertainty. Tomorrow may not ever even be</segment4>
		<segment5>I know what's required of me. I want to do right, I want to do right. What is it that's keeping me from change    </segment5>
