		<segment1>December falls, I don't think I'm okay, not today. When dad came home, he told me go upstairs, I close my eyes. A tear falls down, as I drop onto my bed, not again. My anger hits, as I hear mom cry again. Things are confusing I don't know what I should turn to. Should I run away?. Dad has gone crazy, the last time I think I might, put him in his place. I think I just might run away. December falls, and I forgot it's meaning, to look to Christ. I'll help you dad, I'll show you there's a meaning. I think I should look to my heart.    </segment1>
