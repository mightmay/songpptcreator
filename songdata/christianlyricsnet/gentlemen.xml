		<segment1>We never met, you and I. We were always inside, we were somewhere inside. one another. And I'll live without you love, but what good is one glove, without the other? </segment1>
		<segment2>You only ask about my leaving, well honey I had no choice, so. I call and (when you hear that heavy breathing). for that sound of your voice. </segment2>
		<segment3>But you sit there silent, folded arms. And look down as I walk by. Though my face has changed, you know it's me. You know by the stillness in my eyes. Come and whisper in my ear, &quot;you're very pretty,d ear&quot; and. &quot;it'll be alright.&quot; You're lying!. But I don't mind tonight. </segment3>
		<segment4>So I wander and I wander. Your absence beating inside my chest. I try but I can't remember. The color of your eyes- just the shape of your dress. </segment4>
		<segment5>And through a garden overgrown. Oh, it's a long walk home. I said I'd not come back, well I'm coming back-. and you'd better be alone.     </segment5>
