		<segment1>A little bit of Jesus. And a foreign car. Never learnt to come home. It's too far. Somewhere in the country. You're moving way too fast. For all your hours working. How do you make it last. There's no-one left to tell you, enough</segment1>
		<segment2>One too many take-offs. Staring at the stars. At home beneath the wind-shears. We drift on. The tower yells instructions. You're coming in too low. You need to bring your speed down. Or you'll blow us all too hell. I'm just another Pilot, who followed you down</segment2>
		<segment3>Take me back I'm almost at the end    </segment3>
