		<segment1>Hello, grab your bag and let's go. More out of place than anything you know. Like an opera at a disco. When all you wanted was a rock show tonight. These lights, are they hanging in the distance?. Did they glimmer for an instant?. When they're shining do you feel alright?. Know love, you were looking good tonight.</segment1>
		<segment2>This is the last call. Too long to list it. Please don't you miss it. Don't give up and let them hold you down when they tell you no. We could burn this town.</segment2>
		<segment3>Scream, waking from a bad dream. Don't think anything is what it seems. Can't you figure out what this means?. Don't sit back and keep your hands clean today. We'll say maybe we can find a new way. Or create another great cliche. Storms are coming, why don't we play?. Instead of sitting, dancing in the rain today.</segment3>
		<segment4>So long, they tried to tell you that you don't belong. So, I guess we'll have to prove them wrong. Pretty soon we'll hear them sing along. Ain't it funny that it's our song? So long. </segment4>
		<segment5>. . .     </segment5>
