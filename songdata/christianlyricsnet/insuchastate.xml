		<segment1>In disclosed we speak the truth, discovering dependency. Let's turn this ship around, I'm starting over. We fight our hearts for the control, wrestling our tendencies. Let's turn this ship around, I'm starting over. </segment1>
		<segment2>In desperation, a celebration, of time well spent alone with you. </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm in such a state, I need you here, I need you near me. </segment3>
		<segment4>As the sun will rise and set, so I will keep you close. As the stars illuminate, so I will hold you near </segment4>
		<segment5>Burn the exits, thereÂ’s no escaping from love eternal, limitless. </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm in such a state, I need you here, I need you near me. I'm in such a state, honestly, transparently speaking    </segment6>
