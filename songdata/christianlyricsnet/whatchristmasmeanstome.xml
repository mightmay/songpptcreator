		<segment1>When the Christmas time draws near. We think of joys and Christmas cheer. Of Santa with his reindeer and his sleigh</segment1>
		<segment2>But long ago, we should recall. The Bethlehem Babe was born for all. To show the world the life, the truth, the way</segment2>
		<segment3>The spirit of Christmas is the spirit of Love. It's something that you cannot buy. It's something from above</segment3>
		<segment4>The presents that you give and get. Are nothing but a token. For if they don't come filled with love. The Christmas spirit's broken</segment4>
		<segment5>Just singing Christmas carols and. Just ringing Jingle Bells. Means nothing if you do not know. The story that it tells</segment5>
		<segment6>So, 'midst the din and tinsel as you. Trim the Christmas tree. Let a newborn love enfold you. Embrace you, uphold you. That's the true idea of Christmas. That's what Christmas means to me.    </segment6>
