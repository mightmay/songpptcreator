		<segment1>It's the first day. Since I handed you your final rose. In your house. I'm staring out the window at our tree (We planted below) </segment1>
		<segment2>The heights of which. You'll never. Ever know </segment2>
		<segment3>You always. Were there to rescue me. From December </segment3>
		<segment4>I wonder if you'll look the same. When you embrace me on that day. Will you remember my name. When I return home again? </segment4>
		<segment5>In my mind's eye. I see you next to me as I'm on my knees. It's in this place. That you showed me how to ask eternity </segment5>
		<segment6>For shelter. For comfort. For relief </segment6>
		<segment7>You always. Were there to rescue me. From December </segment7>
		<segment8>I see our branches stretching. To heights you'd not believe. One day these leaves will reach you. And there will be no more </segment8>
		<segment9>Pain </segment9>
		<segment10>You always gave me refuge. Unconditional. You always offered shelter. From December's snow. My chin still rests upon you. While my feet they sway. I wonder if you'll look the same. When you embrace me. On that day.     </segment10>
