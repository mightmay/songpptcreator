		<segment1>Take heart, my friend, we'll go together. This uncertain road that lies ahead. Our faithful God has always gone before us. And He will lead the way once again </segment1>
		<segment2>Take heart, my friend, we can walk together. And if our burdens become too great. We can hold up and help one other. In God's love and God's grace </segment2>
		<segment3>Take heart my friend, the Lord is with us. As He has been all the days of our lives. Our assurance every morning. Our defender in the night </segment3>
		<segment4>If we should falter when trouble surrounds us. When the wind and the waves are wild and high. We will look away to Him who ruled the waters. Who spoke His peace into the angry tide </segment4>
		<segment5>He is our comfort, our sustainer. He is our help in time of need. When we wander, He is our Shepherd. He who watches over us never sleeps </segment5>
		<segment6>Take heart my friend the Lord is with us. As He has been all the days of our lives. Our assurance every morning. Our defender in the night    </segment6>
