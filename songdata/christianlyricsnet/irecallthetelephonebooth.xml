		<segment1>you left on a train. on the morning of october. &quot;won't you button up your coat?&quot; I said &quot;it's cold out here&quot;. who was I to think. there could ever be a future. you assured me once. it was all I could bear, as I waited on the corner. the telephone booth, I recall</segment1>
		<segment2>you wrote of tragedies. on a letter stained with your tears. &quot;I will never be the same&quot;. I said &quot;to me, you will&quot;. in the evening I remained. still unsettled on the corner. would your voice return to me. at the end of this wire?. or will we always be. this lonely?    </segment2>
