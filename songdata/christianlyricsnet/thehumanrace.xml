		<segment1>In a world of winners and losers. Some are used, some are the users. Its a push and shove race. Of trying to get ahead. In the dust of all the confusion. We make a choice, Truth or illusion. Will we listen to lies. Or hear what the Father says</segment1>
		<segment2>We are running in a human race. Where nobody wants to settle for second place. But weve got to run it at a different pace. Cause the first will be last and the last will be first. At the end of the human race</segment2>
		<segment3>In a day when values are changing. What kind of ground are we really gaining. Who are we trying to serve by going the extra mile. We cant trade the Truth for the fashion. Weve got to live a life of compassion. And those we touch are the prize. That waits at the finish line</segment3>
		<segment4>We are running in a human race. Where nobody wants to settle for second place. But weve got to run it at a different pace. Cause the first will be last and the last will be first. At the end of the human race</segment4>
		<segment5>We are running in the human race. We must run it at a different pace. Cause well all meet the Father face to face. At the finish line of the human race. We are running in the human race. We must run it at a different pace. Cause well all meet the Father face to face. At the finish line of the human race.     </segment5>
