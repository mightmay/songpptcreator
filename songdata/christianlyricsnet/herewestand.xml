		<segment1>We can see it, God You're moving. We can feel it, in our bones. Turn our hearts to all You're doing. With a shout we cry. With a shout we cry</segment1>
		<segment2>Open wide heaven's gates. Let your glory fill this place. Here we stand in awe. Here we stand in awe. Lifting high every heart. Giving You every part. Here we stand in awe. Here we stand in awe</segment2>
		<segment3>We are filled with expectation. As we're reaching for Your throne. There's an anthem, hear it rising. With a shout we cry. With a shout we cry</segment3>
		<segment4>There's nothing like Your presence God. There's nothing like Your presence God. Theres nothing like Your presence God. Theres nothing like Your presence God    </segment4>
