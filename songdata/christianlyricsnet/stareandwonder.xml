		<segment1>Through this window, I see my vision is crystall clear. It won't be long now. Never tainted. It won't be long now. Always crystal. The darkest night. I used to feel alive. Could we believe it?. Could they believe it?. I could feel the twisting in the wells of my inner self. Could we believe it?. Could I believe it?. (spoken). If seeing is believing, then this heart has never been beating.</segment1>
		<segment2>You should have let me live at least for one more day. Instead the silence takes me in vain. Everything you choose to say. Your piercing gaze. It rips my soul away. You should have let me live in vain. Just stare and wonder when I'm gone. Just stare and wonder why.. You should let me live. It won't be long now..never tainted always crystal.. Just stare and wonder when I'm gone. Just stare and wonder why..    </segment2>
