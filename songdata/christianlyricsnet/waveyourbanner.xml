		<segment1>Verse 1: When you look at me. Tell me what you see. Can you tell what I'm all about. If I never ever said a word. Would my life just scream it loud. That I'm a C-H-R-I-S-T-I-A-N. That's how I represent</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: If you like the music (4x). Wave your banner (4x)</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Unforgettable all together wonderful. There is no way to describe. My walk, my talk anf the way that I feel inside. Is way to incredible. I can never hide. That I'm a C-H-R-I-S-T-I-A-N. That how I represent</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus (repeat)</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: Now it was told to me. When the enemy comes in like a flood. Ah ah ah. The Lord will. Ah ah ah. Lift up a standard. Ah ah ah. It's a banner</segment5>
