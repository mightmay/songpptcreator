		<segment1>You were sittin in my picture. You had the hair of choice. As a matter of fact you thought I couldn't see through. Your silly voice</segment1>
		<segment2>You're talking down but you ain't down. Quit talking down to me</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't try to take my money. Its all I have this week. And don't you tell me to pick up the phone now. Spiritual beast</segment3>
		<segment4>My conscious overwhelms me. That's when you get control. But you don't have the power. To make me fold    </segment4>
