		<segment1>Fleeting breath, Frailest flesh. I'm a casualty at best. And so I sink into Your depth. My only place of rest</segment1>
		<segment2>Where earth and wind, and sky and sea. Could never match Your majesty. From where I stand, I'm crying out. Jesus, You are life to me</segment2>
		<segment3>The treachery of valleys deep. Has only made me weak. I clothe this flesh with holiness. My only place of rest</segment3>
		<segment4>Where earth and wind, and sky and sea. Will never match Your majesty. From where I stand, I'm crying out. Jesus, You are life to me</segment4>
		<segment5>And when I see Your face I'll know. All the pain and tears will go. To the bottom of the sea. You'll forever be holy, holy</segment5>
		<segment6>Holy (4x)</segment6>
		<segment7>Where earth and wind, and sky and sea. Will never match Your majesty. From where I stand, I'm crying out. Jesus, You are life to me</segment7>

		<segment9>Holy..(8x)</segment9>
		<segment10>When all is fallen (You are life to me). When all is broken (You are life to me). When all is empty (You are life to me). Life to me, life to me</segment10>
		<segment11>Life to me..</segment11>
