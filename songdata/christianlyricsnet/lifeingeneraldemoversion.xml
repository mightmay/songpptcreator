		<segment1>I don't understand what's going on in my life these days. Everything upside down turned around. Won't waste my life, no way. And I don't know why. I can't see clearly?. I can't think 'cause it's too early. So many doubts frequent my mind all the time. Our lives in general are one in the same, But there's no variations. Our lives in general are on in the same. But there's no difference of opinion. In my younger years, I used to be so free. But I don't know what's happening to me. We all know by now that time's the enemy. It controls us, tells us where to be. Don't know, don't care. If you need me, I'll be right here    </segment1>
