		<segment1>Is not He who formed the ear Worth the time it takes to hear?. Should He who formed our lips for speaking Be not heeded when He speaks?. Will you not listen?. Why won't you listen?. God has spoken love to us Why will you not listen? Listen to the sacred silence Listen to the Holy Word Listen as He speaks through living Parables that must be heard Will you not listen?. Why won't you listen?. God has spoken peace to us Why will you not listen?. He spoke a word of flesh and blood Flesh and blood that bled and died Bled and died just to be heard How could you not hear this Word?. Why will you not hear this Word?. Will you not listen?. Why won't you listen?. God has spoken hope to us How could you not listen?. Why will you not listen?. The Kingdom So near and yet still so far, far away So close, and yet still to come Concealed, the seed is mysteriously growing In hearts that will listen and hear A treasure that's hidden, a pearl of great price A fortune for fools who believe </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: </segment2>
		<segment3>A kingdom of beauty, a kingdom of love A kingdom of justice and peace A kingdom that hold all the wilds of creation A kingdom where children will lead    </segment3>
