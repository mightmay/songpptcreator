		<segment1>As long as I remember. I've been walking through the wilderness. Praying to the Father and waiting for My time. I've come here with a mission. And soon, I'll give My life for this world</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm praying in the garden, and I'm looking for a miracle. I find the journey hard, but it was the reason I was born. Can this cup be passed on?. Lord, I pray Your will be done in this world</segment2>
		<segment3>So I carry My cross, and I'll carry the shame. To the end of the road. Through the struggle and pain, and I'll do it for love. No, it won't be in vain. Yes, I'll carry My cross. And I'll carry the shame</segment3>
		<segment4>I feel like I'm alone here, and I'm treated like a criminal. The time has come for me now, even though I've done no wrong. Father, please forgive them, they know not what they've done in this world</segment4>
		<segment5>Three more days and I'll be coming back again. There more days and I'll be coming back again</segment5>
		<segment6>    </segment6>
