		<segment1>14 kids in an old church van. With a light in their eyes. and some tracts in their hands. 60 MPH seems way too slow. when you got the Chevy pointed. down to Mexico.</segment1>
		<segment2>We all want to run. the race to win. Never giving up or giving in. Coming at you like a blitz.</segment2>
		<segment3>They've had three flats. and their radiators leaking. Ain't nothing gonna keep'em. from the prize that they're seeking. They're riding all together. and it's in God's hand.</segment3>
		<segment4>Ain't nothing gonna keep'em. from the prize that they're seeking.</segment4>
		<segment5>They don't get around like ordinary fans. 14 kids in an old church van.    </segment5>
