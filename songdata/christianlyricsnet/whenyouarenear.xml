		<segment1>Theres no need to say a thing, When Im before you in this silence. I feel refreshed with peace. Break this noise that binds the voice. That tries speak open up my eyes to see. Your gracious sovereign reach</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. Its hard to talk when I feel that you are near, When all is quiet its the beauty that I hear, This hidden place where I know that you calm my fears. I know that youve washed my tears</segment2>
		<segment3>The seasons of change Ive faced. Have never left me wounded. Only scars of hurt. But never deeply rooted. This healing I have felt. No burden can replace. Redemptive hope has been the story of my pain</segment3>
		<segment4>All is lost without the breath of life you give. And you give so much. I want nothing more than you so heres my heart </segment4>
		<segment5>.     </segment5>
