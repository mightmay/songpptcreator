		<segment1>opening salvo. didn't help solve anything. every time we shout our rights out. we get all grouchy and gray </segment1>
		<segment2>it's all about me, me. it's all about what I can take. and if that doesn't ring true anymore. maybe it was our first mistake </segment2>
		<segment3>and since we don't believe in Santa Claus. maybe we'd best stay awake </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: every time a teardrop falls. it's kicking up dust in our world of pain. let's get drenched under God's good rain. caught in a deluge of mercies. like a pebble clings to dirt. we're still clinging to bedrock sin. let's get swept off our feet again. caught in a landslide of love </segment4>
		<segment5>it's all about me, me. it's all about all I can take. the good I try to do goes nowhere. the bad just seizes the day </segment5>
		<segment6>and if we're here for something bigger, baby. there's gotta be some better way </segment6>
		<segment7>- Chorus - </segment7>
		<segment8>Bridge: no, not angels or devils. no, not famine or war. no, not the past or the present. not even the ground separates from God's love. not even the ground separates from His love </segment8>
		<segment9>'cause every time a teardrop falls. it's kicking up dust in our world of pain. let's get drenched under God's good rain. caught in a deluge of mercies. and like a pebble cased in dirt. we've been anchored in bedrock sin. let's get swept off our feet again. caught in a landslide of love. caught in a landslide of love    </segment9>
