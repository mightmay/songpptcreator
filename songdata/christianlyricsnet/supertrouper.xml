		<segment1>You were meant to live large. Come on take charge. Let's go light the world up. Let's not wait until the end. To be the things we wish we'd been </segment1>
		<segment2>You were meant to live life. Come on let's fly. You're a super trouper spotlight. We're gonna jump on the count of three. Here it comes now. One two three jump </segment2>
		<segment3>If you were a country you'd be Switzerland. You never take a stand your policy is never to offend. If you were a gambler you would always win. You'd only bet on the horses after they had already come in. And I'm sorry that I'm getting on your case. But true friends they stab you in the face </segment3>
		<segment4>You were meant to live large. Come on take charge. Let's go light the world up. Let's not wait until the end. To be the things we wish we'd been </segment4>
		<segment5>You were meant to live life. Come on let's fly. You're a super trouper spotlight. We're gonna jump on the count of three. Here it comes now. One two three jump. If you were in a movie you'd be thug number 5. Cuz you don't try out for a starring role but your name belongs In lights. If you got a GI Joe you'd never open up the box. Safe inside its plastic prison waiting for the day it rots. And I'm sorry that I'm getting on your case. But true friends they stab you in the face </segment5>
		<segment6>You were meant to live large. Come on take charge. Let's go light the world up. Let's not wait until the end. To be the things we wish we'd been </segment6>
		<segment7>You were meant to live life. Come on let's fly. You're a super trouper spotlight. We're gonna jump on the count of three. Here it comes now. One two three jump     </segment7>
