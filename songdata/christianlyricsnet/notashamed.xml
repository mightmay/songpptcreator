		<segment1>We're not ashamed of the One we love. There's a King of love who takes away our shame. The cross of Christ is our victory. The Saviour's set us free, the Saviour He's alive. [ Lyrics from: http://www.cloverlyrics.com/e83734-ben_cantelon~not_ashamed_lyrics.html ]. Chorus. Oh no we won't stay silent. We'll shout it out from the rooftops singing. We're not ashamed we're not ashamed of You, Jesus</segment1>
		<segment2>No turning back, now to live for You. Tell the world it's true You're the one and only way</segment2>
		<segment3>No backing down let the streets resound. Sing it louder now for all the earth to hear</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Oh no we won't stay silent. We'll shout it out from the rooftops singing. We're not ashamed, not ashamed of You, Jesus. The time is now or never. To tell the world You're the only Saviour. We're not ashamed, not ashamed of You Jesus    </segment4>
