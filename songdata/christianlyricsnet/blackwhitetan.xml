		<segment1>Momma looks like coffee, Daddy looks like cream. Baby is a mocha drop American dream. All the colors of the rainbow are in her family tree. Woven all together in a paisley tapestry. She holds real tightly to her parents' hands. Baby loves that woman, baby loves that man. And her soul gives a smile 'cause she understands. Our love is black, white, tan. Yeah, yeah, yeah black, white, tan</segment1>
		<segment2>Everyone is precious in the Father's sight. It don't matter red or yellow, black or white. He just loves ya 'cause He loves ya. I tell you this is true. You are not a color and a color is not you. So hold real tightly to your Daddy's hands. 'Cause he loves that woman, He loves that man. And let your soul give a smile 'cause you understand. That love is black, white, tan. yeah, yeah, yeah black, white, tan</segment2>
		<segment3>Na, na, na, na, na. . </segment3>
		<segment4>So hold real tightly to your Daddy's hands. 'Cause he loves that woman, and he loves that man. And let your soul give a smile every once in a while. Let your soul give a smile every once in a while (repeat 2x). 'Cause love is black, white, tan. Yeah, I know God's love is black, white, tan. Yes I know God's love is black, white, tan. Little girl will tell you black, white and tan    </segment4>
