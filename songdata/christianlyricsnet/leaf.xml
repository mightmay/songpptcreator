		<segment1>If you fail to see a problem, (Which I find hard to believe). Or if you're hanging on from branches. Licking honey from the leaves you say. &quot;The hopelessness of living, the childishness of suicide&quot;. But there's a call to love my brother. That can never be destroyed however much you talk, However well you talk you make a certain sense. It's still only stupid talk, however much I strut around, However loud I sing the Shining One inside me won't say anything,</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, to want one thing!. Purity of heart is to want one thing.</segment2>
		<segment3>You'll remind me that I said you were. A quiet bed in all my noise to rest. Well I was charming you at best. And you remember, dear, when I said. &quot;My coming here was like a terrible fall!&quot;. As we crept like thieves along your bedroom hall. I'd come down and touch your eyelids, But if you stay up too late I'll throw you back into the cupboard. With the chipped and dirty plates. Like the carnival game with the bottleneck and rubber ring, Even if you win, even then you don't win.</segment3>
		<segment4>All I want is to want one thing.    </segment4>
