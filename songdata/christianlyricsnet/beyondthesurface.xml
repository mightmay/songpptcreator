		<segment1>I've been hiding, hiding for so long right behind my digital mask. I've been trying to be someone I'm not. All these perfectly fake people push us to insane ideals. They're nothing more than counterfeit images </segment1>
		<segment2>That push me away, to bleed out the pain. Don't you dare to make another move </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS:]. Put the knife away that's not what anybody needs. There's a better way than everything now that you see. Stop comparing who you are to who you want to be. Let's step out beyond the surface </segment3>
		<segment4>Don't give in to everything the world around tells you to be. Open up your mind release yourself. Stop the lying stop comparing who you are to what you see. Never letting fear hold back the change </segment4>
		<segment5>And push you away, to bleed out the pain. Don't you dare to make another move</segment5>
		<segment6>    </segment6>
