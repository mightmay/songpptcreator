		<segment4>Well, I know you're gonna change around me. Yeah, I know you're gonna change around me. Well, I know you're gonna change around me. Yeah, I know you're gonna change around me</segment4>
		<segment5>Today I saw you. Tomorrow slap me sideways. Today I saw you. Tomorrow slap me sideways    </segment5>
