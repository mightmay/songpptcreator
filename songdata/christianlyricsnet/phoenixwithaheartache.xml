		<segment1>It's a bone cold night. I'm breathing in the air. It's freezing up my lungs, as I fight for words to share with you, to tell you what you've done to me. You ripped me from my set in stone complacency. You rose from the ashes. Like a phoenix with a heartache. Now you're taking me away with you tonight and I know that I can't fly. But when I'm in your arms, I'm holding up the sky. It's a bone cold night. I'm writhing in despair. It's freezing up my heart, as you fight for words to share with me, to tell me what my eyes can't see. You ripped me from my set in stone complacency. And there you were, standing there, Like an answer to a dream I never had. You showed me everything, showed me everything, showed me everything I never knew about me.    </segment1>
