		<segment1>Well I know that this is real, because it passes what I feel. But Im feeling what I know and its unexplainable. And if you could feel that air, run through fields without a care. And the grass would blow on you well then you would know it too</segment1>
		<segment2>But grass dies and night falls and skies cloud to dark. It seems that its different, but youre near so real so complete</segment2>
		<segment3>And the air I breathe, so full, so deep. Forever so complete, forever so complete. The air I breathe, so full, so deep. Forever so complete, forever so complete</segment3>
		<segment4>I could take you there, where you could feel that air. And the worlds could spin around, but its always, always found. When you feel that dear run through fields without a care. And the grass would blow on you and then you would know it too</segment4>
		<segment5>But grass dies and night falls and skies cloud to dark. It seems that its different, but youre near so real so complete</segment5>
		<segment6>And the air I breathe, so full, so deep. Forever so complete, forever so complete. The air I breathe, so full, so deep. Forever so complete, forever so complete    </segment6>
