		<segment1>It's been so long since I have met You here. Since I have said these words or cried these tears. And like a child would come I run into our secret place. And as the music fades, the tears are rolling down my face </segment1>
		<segment2>I am alive in this moment. In this moment I am found. I am alive in this moment. In this moment I belong </segment2>
		<segment3>It's been so long since I have met You here. Since I have heard You speak or let You near. And like a wayward son I've come with nothing left to hide. Here in this moment I have come to offer up my life </segment3>
		<segment4>Here only one fire burns, it burns. Here only one melody is heard. Once again for the very first time. My eyes are opening    </segment4>
