		<segment1>I retreat. By myself at the back of my brain. I cannot see. What You're showing me through this pain. I have found. That I have found. Nothing for so long</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I don't understand. I don't need to. I know You've a plan. You will see through. It is in Your hands. I believe You</segment2>
		<segment3>I say goodbye. I leave my loved ones far behind. I'm asking. Why is this is the story of my life. I have found. That I have found. Nothing for so long</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I was only wondering. I've been trying to understand. I know there is more. So much more than I can see</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus 2x).     </segment6>
