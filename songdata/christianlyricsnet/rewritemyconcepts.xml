		<segment1>Gasping for one breath of resolution. I'm left with burns in the third. degree to a degree of failure. You failed me I failed you. Just one piece of the whole picture. A glance away from the running storm. One way into the warmth. I have not one piece unharmed</segment1>
		<segment2>You've taken that glance you rewrote. it into your eternity of warmth. You rewrote it into eternity. These battles I never sought. I ask you in honesty how can I see past this reality. Comfort take me in. but I want to see it in the fullness. of what it should mean to me. Show me why I have these tears for you    </segment2>
