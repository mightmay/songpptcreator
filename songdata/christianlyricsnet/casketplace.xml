		<segment1>Do we have much time. To live until we find. A lot of things are happening all at once?. Crime and violence grow. While earthquakes take their toll. Morality is low and what about AIDS? </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS 1: Sometimes I think this worlds asleep. So we just might be history. It all keeps adding up. I think Im waking up. Im not just paranoid, Im not alone </segment2>
		<segment3>I went to a bank. To use the cash machine. What happens when those cash machines are shut down?. I went to Al Gore. He said Earth's life support. Has nearly been destroyed, no cure can be found </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS 2: Sometimes I think this worlds asleep. Keep your eyes on the Middle East. The signs keep adding up. I think Im waking up. Im not just paranoid, Im not alone </segment4>
		<segment5>Christ will soon return. So you better know God </segment5>
		<segment6>(Break) </segment6>
		<segment7>(CHORUS 1).     </segment7>
