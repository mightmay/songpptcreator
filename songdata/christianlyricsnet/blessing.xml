		<segment1>Here I am Im a soul set free. Caught up in this Mystery. Jesus there is a hope I breathe. For you are in me, You are in me. Here I am with my Chains undone. Caught up in your victory. Singing Songs of a Higher Love. For you are with me, You are with me. And we are ever praising You.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. You brought a blessing and the blessing was you. There was a treasure, and the treasure was you. Lord, we had nothing, now we have all things. We were the lost but found the truth. You brought a blessing, and the blessing was you</segment2>
		<segment3>As I walk through the valley low. I will build a place of hope. Going on from strength to strength. Fro you are in me, you are in me. Nothing Good do you withhold. For the one who walks you way. Id give it all for just one day. That you are with me, you are with me. Yes, we are ever praising you</segment3>
		<segment4>Hearts can find no rest until they find you. You made us for yourself and we will praise you    </segment4>
