		<segment1>Without a doubt I've taken all you can give. And now I suffer through this song. Feel free to hum along</segment1>
		<segment2>Going back a few short years I can see. That I was never really here. As I collect the facts and sort them in rows. It seems the question's always been. How long can I keep this going?</segment2>
		<segment3>You can use it against me. In your saddest state of mind. Use it against me. With my ego on the line. Use it againse me anytime</segment3>
		<segment4>I try to simplify the plot to an outline. But I can never make the end. I want to read some lines that stray from the screenplay. Improvisation's never been. Something I can keep going</segment4>
		<segment5>You can use it against me. In your saddest state of mind. Use it against me. With my ego on the line. Use it against me </segment5>
		<segment6>I've never preached a single word. That doesn't sound absurd. I don't know how to pound it in. To make it stick under my skin</segment6>
		<segment7>You can use it againse me. In your saddest state of mind. Use it against me. With my ego on the line. Use it against me anytime    </segment7>
