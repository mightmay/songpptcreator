		<segment1>When the day is done, we can have our fun. When we see the sun go down. We start our night out on the town. Bundle up it's cold. Let's hit the street we're getting old. We're wearing ourselves thin. And tomorrow night we'll do it again</segment1>
		<segment2>We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones. BMX all night</segment2>
		<segment3>Goosetops, rooftops, midnight flights. When you see us from the hill. Move yourself, we ride to kill. We'll ride in your town too. Cause we're a touring crew. From Seattle to L.A. Chicago to New York to Tampa Bay</segment3>
		<segment4>We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones, whoa. We're the broken bones!!!    </segment4>
