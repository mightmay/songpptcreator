		<segment1>Friends with words of scoffing strike my cheek with scorn. They mass and stand as one against me. How long will they crush me with their words?. Great brick walls in building  bridges theyve long burned. Theyve walled up my way and I cannot pass. Darkness has set upon my paths.</segment1>
		<segment2>All of my cherished friends abhor me and turn against me. My bones stick to my skin and flesh, and Ive escaped with the skin of my teeth. All of my cherished friends abhor me and turn against me. My bones stick to my skin and flesh, and Ive escaped with the skin of my teeth.</segment2>
		<segment3>Who is on my side? Who is on my side?</segment3>
		<segment4>Who is on my side? Who is on my side?. Who is on my side? Who is on my side?</segment4>
		<segment5>Who.. Before the war everyone was on my side. When I hit the ground no help had followed. Before the war everyone was on my side. When I hit the ground no help had followed.</segment5>
		<segment6>I have not come to bring peace, I have come to bring a sword.    </segment6>
