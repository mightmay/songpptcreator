		<segment1>yesterday i lived for me. and i was so alone as i could be. then i saw you and how you give yourself away. and i want to live for you today</segment1>
		<segment2>i'll give; i'll hold nothing. i'll give and i'll hold nothing back</segment2>
		<segment3>my love is a lot like me. wanting nothing less than everything. but i know you're the only love that's true. and only giving makes me close to you</segment3>
		<segment4>my hands are open, so take what you see. and i keep nothing, hold nothing back for me.    </segment4>
