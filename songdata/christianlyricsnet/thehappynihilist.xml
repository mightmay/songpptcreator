		<segment1>I am a happy nihilist, no absolute truth does exist. When I decide to shake my fist, I only got myself to blame. Cause were all players and life's the game</segment1>
		<segment2>I only take what I need, I am so light on my feet. I will not stop or concede, I am not driven by greed. No moral compass for me, it's all just natural feelings. Existence has no meaning, there's no such thing as happy. But late at night when I sleep, I dream of more than I see. There's something burning in me, a driving need to be free, Why do I sit here and think about the things that I need?. There's nothing left to believe, oh is it all just a dream?</segment2>
		<segment3>Ive taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf. But it still hurts like h*ll to trust nobody else but me</segment3>
		<segment4>I used to read everything, I used to need nothing. I put my money on me, I used to be something. Now I cant sleep, cause Im not happy</segment4>
		<segment5>Ive taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf. But it still hurts like h*ll to trust nobody else but me</segment5>
		<segment6>Whoa oh oh. Why am I haunted by the metaphysical?. Is it a cosmic lie or is it literal?. The books I read that used to free my mind. Have made me more blind but the truth Ill find it. I was a happy nihilist. Now Im wondering why I exist</segment6>
		<segment7>Ive taught this to myself, piled books up on the shelf. But it still hurts like h*ll to trust nobody else but me     </segment7>
