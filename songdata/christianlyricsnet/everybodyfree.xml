		<segment1>The longing in my heart has stirred a faded memory. Of my young heart beating fast behind the willow tree. I was counting out loud, and I only peeked a time or two. And the only purpose in my life was finding you. Singing Ollie, Ollie everybody free!. Now was I chasing you or were you chasing me?</segment1>
		<segment2>We all grow up and put away our childhood games. But deep inside I wonder if we really change. Cause I'm still seeking, though. I've learned to hide so well. And I can still remember how it felt. Singing Ollie, Ollie everybody free!. Will I ever find someone pursuing me?</segment2>
		<segment3>And then you caught me by surprise. I found my tears are in your eyes. I hear my heart inside of you. At last I've found something somebody who. Can free my soul. And love me too</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't believe we hide so long and run so well. When all the while we're aching to be caught and held. But it's only in surrender that our freedom comes. And so I run abandoned to your waiting arms. Singing Ollie, Ollie everybody free!&quot;. I belong to you and you belong to me!</segment4>
		<segment5> Singing Ollie, Ollie everybody free!&quot;    </segment5>
