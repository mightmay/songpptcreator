		<segment1>No magistrate can legislate. Peace and love and hope. No song can end or sermon mend. The fatal flaws in our souls. Pen and paper, Whitehouse won. Will never do what we need done</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus:</segment2>
		<segment3>Can't give me. What I crave-. Can't give me. What I crave-. The end of tears and fears and war. Is what I'm craving in my core. Can't give me. What I crave. What I crave</segment3>
		<segment4>No millions spent can pay the rent. And get us into kingdom come. No atom bomb could right the wrong. Inside the veins of everyone. All the glitter, tanks and guns. Will never do what we need done</segment4>
		<segment5>Nothing here beneath the sun. Can make us holy make us one. Only Spirit, second birth. Can satisfy my constant thirst. To spill out heaven here on earth     </segment5>
