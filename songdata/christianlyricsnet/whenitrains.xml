		<segment1>And when it rains, On this side of town it touches, everything. Just say it again and mean it. We don't miss a thing. You made yourself a bed. At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole). And convinced yourself that. It's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore</segment1>
		<segment2>And no, oh, how could you do it?. Oh I, I never saw it coming. No, oh, I need the ending. So why can't you stay. Just long enough to explain?</segment2>
		<segment3>And when it rains, Will you always find an escape?. Just running away, From all of the ones who love you, From everything. You made yourself a bed. At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole). And you'll sleep 'til May. And you'll say that you don't want to see the sun anymore</segment3>
		<segment4>And no, oh, how could you do it?. Oh I, I never saw it coming. And no, oh, I need the ending. So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?</segment4>
		<segment5>Take your time. Take my time.</segment5>
		<segment6>Take these chances to turn it around. (take your time). Take these chances, we'll make it somehow. And take these chances to turn it around. (take my..). Just turn it around.</segment6>
		<segment7>No, how could you do it?. Oh I, I never saw it coming. No, oh, how could you do it?. Oh I, I never saw it coming. No, oh, how could you do it?. Oh I, I never saw it coming. No, oh I need an ending. So why can't you stay. Just long enough to explain?</segment7>
		<segment8>You can take your time, take my time.    </segment8>
