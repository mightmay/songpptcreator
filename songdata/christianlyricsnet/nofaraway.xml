		<segment1>When I ran from You. I ran to You. And when I tried to hide. I found You there. When I told You no. You knew right where Id go. So when I ran from You. I ran to You</segment1>
		<segment2>Theres no way to get far away from You. Theres no way to get far away from You. Theres nowhere I could go. That Youre not already there. Theres no way to get far away from You</segment2>
		<segment3>There is no height or depth. To hold you back. There is no tower veil. To hide your face. 'Cause you tore it down. Now we see You all around. So when we run from You. We run to You</segment3>
		<segment4>Theres no way to get far away from You. Theres no way to get far away from You. Theres nowhere I could go. That Youre not already there. Theres no way to get far away from You</segment4>
		<segment5>I fell so far. I was so far gone. Then I saw You. Yeah I saw You. Ive climbed so high. That I could not breathe. Then I saw You there. You called me close and my heart gave in. Then I saw You yeah I saw You. Well what matters the most -. In the midst of my sin. I saw You there. I saw You there</segment5>
		<segment6>Theres no way to get far away from You. Theres no way to get far away from You. Theres nowhere I could go. That Youre not already there. Theres no way to get far away from You</segment6>
		<segment7>When I ran from You. I ran to You     </segment7>
