		<segment1>I know there's hope in anger. And tenderness in shame. Sometimes I find you. On the other side of pain</segment1>
		<segment2>But sometimes in the heat of day. When I close my eyes to pray. It seems like you are far from me. My prayers are all in vain</segment2>
		<segment3>In my hour of hopelessness. In my deep despair. The noonday devil whispers in my ear</segment3>
		<segment4>I know that you are with me. But I can't feel a thing. The noonday devil. Has come around again</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh Lord, make me angry. Oh Lord, make me cry. Oh Lord, please don't leave me here. To fall into the devil's lies</segment5>
		<segment6>Father, you have called me. To live a life that's true. That all my labors and my words. Would speak my love for you</segment6>
		<segment7>But walking through this desert. Life is empty and mundane. The noonday devil. Has come around again</segment7>
		<segment8>Oh Lord, make me angry. Oh Lord, make me cry. Oh Lord, please don't leave me here. To fall into the devil's lies</segment8>
		<segment9>Oh Lord, make me angry. Oh Lord, make me cry. Oh Lord, break my cold, cold heart. So I can know your love inside. Your love inside.     </segment9>
