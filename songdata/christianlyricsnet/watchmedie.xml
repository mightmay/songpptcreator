		<segment1>I lay as this sacrifice to this unholy altar. The evil inside Satan; Satan sit and watch me die. Demented screams, tortured beings, where's your hope, where's your smile, there was none. Life of lies gone, gone no more. So upset, so distraught, I'm sorry, I'm Sorry.. I live for the Lord. Watch me die no longer I am alive. My purpose no more.. I live for Christ. Dead to sin, only begin, imagine what's for Soldier of Christ. Changed with a new beginning, blood of the lamb, white washed sins. Forgive me God for all of these years of my transgressions. I cry renewed, I cry renewed This world means nothing to me. My life changed I now see Crucified with Christ, the old self left with the rest of this world, rest of this world. Kneel before his throne, home now from this journey. I see my father in his arms finally found. This path I have chosen is hard. but I'll make it with my saviors help. I survive this hell till the end I'll stand true. Eternal life, ready for the fight that the evil brings. No giving in.. I'm free. The fire burns engulfing all the victims in it's path, no where to run. Over taken they give in to surrender to the Lord once, and for all. No longer keeping quiet, no longer standing still, no longer giving in, no longer going back. I stand strong praying for love always to be in my heart    </segment1>
