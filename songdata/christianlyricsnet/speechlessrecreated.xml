		<segment1>Words fall like drops of rain. My lips are like clouds. I've said so many things, trying to figure you out. But as mercy opens my eyes, and my words are stolen away. With this breathtaking view of your grace..</segment1>
		<segment2>And I am Speechless. I'm astonished and amazed. I am silenced by your wondrous grace. You have saved me. You have raised me from the grave. And I am Speechless. In your presence now. I'm astounded as I consider how. You have shown us a love that leaves us speechless.</segment2>
		<segment3>So what kind of love could this be. That would trade heaven's throne for a cross. And to think you still celebrate. over finding just one who was lost. And to know you rejoice over us. The God of this whole universe. It's a story thats too great for words..</segment3>
		<segment4>We are speechless. Oh how great is the love. The Father has lavished upon us, That we should be called the sons and daughters of God. We are speechless</segment4>
		<segment5>We stand in awe of your grace. (so amazed). We stand in awe of your mercy. (you have saved us). We stand in awe of your love. (from the grave). We are speechless</segment5>
		<segment6>We stand in awe of your voice. (in your presence now). We stand in awe of your power. (We're astounded as we consider how). We are speechless (You have shown us a love that leaves us speechless)    </segment6>
