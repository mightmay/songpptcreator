		<segment1>Convinced of my deception. I've always been a fool. I fear this love reaction. Just like you said I would </segment1>
		<segment2>A rose could never lie. About the love it brings. And I could never promise. To be any of those things </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: If I was not so weak. If I was not so cold. If I was not so scared of being broken. Growing old. I would be.. I would be.. I would be.. </segment3>
		<segment4>Blessed are the shallow. Depth they'll never find. Seemed to be some comfort. In rooms I try to hide </segment4>
		<segment5>Exposed beyond the shadows. You take the cup from me. Your dirt removes my blindness. Your pain becomes my peace </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>..frail     </segment7>
