		<segment1>Lately I'm alright. and lately I'm not scared. I've figured out, that what you do to me feels like. I'm floating on air. I don't need to know right now. all I know is I believe. in the very thing that got us here. and now I can't leave.</segment1>
		<segment2>Say anything, but say what you mean, cause I'm caught in suspension.</segment2>
		<segment3>Now, I'm wanting this for sure. and I'll beg for nothing more. I'll plan all day and drive all night. you'll love what's in store. I cant seem to stop this now. even if its not so clear, and I'll take what I can get. If you want me here (If you want me here)</segment3>
		<segment4>Say anything, but say what you mean. When you whisper you want this. your eyes tell the same. We are gaining speed. I can barely breathe. Cause I'm caught in suspension.</segment4>
		<segment5>It's enough for me to get excited, it's enough for me to feel..OH!</segment5>
		<segment6>Say anything, but say what you mean. When you whisper you want this. Your eyes tell the same. We are gaining speed (suspension). I can barely breathe (Oh please say what you mean). I'm caught in suspension (suspension)</segment6>
		<segment7>Say (say) anything (suspension). but say what you mean. (Oh, I can barely breathe). I'm caught in suspension. I'm caught in suspension. We are gaining speed, (suspension). I can barely breathe. (Oh I can barely breathe). Cause I'm caught in suspension. I'm caught in suspension. [2x].     </segment7>
