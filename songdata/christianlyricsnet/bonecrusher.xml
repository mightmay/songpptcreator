		<segment1>They're telling us how to live our live. Our lives I've been accused of a murder I've. Done worse I guess there's. Nothing to lose so teach me. I'm couting crows in the street that. Kind of motion you'd better get it RUN..CRUSH..BONECRUSHER..SHOCK you. Shocker I've done a lot of things. Wrong I can't set 'em right let's strike. A match we'll burn the night. I know you want it I know you. Need but you're always talking to the. Wrong man I know you want it it's what. You need but you're always talking. To the wrong man take me off. The stage because I'm good. For nothing and I'm here to say. Teach them my wicked ways call me. To the floor time's fading fast now. Tell the whole world it's over. Just don't forget they. Loved us oh man come on set it. Right they loved us oh man come on set it. Higher and higher higher than high you. Play the fool and I'll be the king. We'll sing a tune (tear this place down). No one's getting out alive. Put me in the ground. With the worse tell them there's no need for a. Hearse I'm causing those fires in. The street put me in the lions. Den teeth clenched and. Bones crushing I'm the man. With both eyes closed alright now I'm. Coming back Take me off the stage. Because I'm good for nothing. And I'm here to say teach. Them my wicked ways. Call me to the floor time's fading. Fast now tell the whole world it's over just. Don't forget they loved us. There's no regret </segment1>
