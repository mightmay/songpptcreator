		<segment1>I stumble to the mirror. Say everything's all right. But the man in the mirror. Never lies. The aged face I see. Staring back at me. Shows the years. Shows the miles. Now I'm no perfect husband. But I do so love my wife. And my kids are the greatest gift. I know. But some times when I'm alone. I still wrestle with my soul. And start feeling out of place. Like a lost boy. Trying to get back home</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: After all. The heartache and the pain. All the bridges I have crossed. And the ones I've left in flames. After all. The sorrow and regret. All the times I turned away. When you called. You still love me. After all</segment2>
		<segment3>The story of my life. I keep hidden deep inside. Like a book collecting dust. Upon a shelf. But it's there inside of me. That man that no one sees. The one that falls apart. But I'm strong enough. To never let it show</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I don't pretend to know. Why the truth has been so slow. To go the distance. From my head down to my heart. I know the journey's not that great. But for all the time it takes. I'd swear that we were worlds apart</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
