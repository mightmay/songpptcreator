		<segment1>I'm so scared that you will see. All the weakness inside of me. I'm so scared of letting go. That the pain I've hid will show</segment1>
		<segment2>I know you want to hear me speak. But I'm afraid that if I start to. I'll never stop</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I want you to know. You belong in my life. I love the hope. I see in your eyes. For you I would fly. At least I would try. For you I'll take. The last flight out</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm afraid that. You will leave. As my secrets. Have been revealed. In my dreams. You'll always stay. Every breathing moment from now</segment4>
		<segment5>I know you want to hear me speak. But I'm afraid that if I start to. I'll never stop</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>I cannot hold back. The truth no more. I let you wait too long. Although it's hard and scares me so. A life without you scares me more    </segment7>
