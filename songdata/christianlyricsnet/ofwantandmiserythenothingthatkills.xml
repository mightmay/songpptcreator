		<segment1>I watched you float away on a wave of want and misery. now I've got to find you. I watched you float away on whatever caught your eye. now I've got to find you. 'cause I've got to keep your head above the water. while the current pulls me under</segment1>
		<segment2>I will hang my life in the space between the noose and your neck. I won't let you die just yet</segment2>
		<segment3>I will love you even when you won't let me. and you will kill me by doing nothing. but I know it's not you, my dear, I know it's not you. I know it's not you, my dear, it's the nothing that kills</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't save you. control is something out of mine. no, I can't save you. control is something out of my control</segment4>
		<segment5>I can't save you but I will love you. no, I can't save you but I will love you. I'd like to think that this is love. lost in second chances without end. this is romance    </segment5>
