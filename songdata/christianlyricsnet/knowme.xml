		<segment1>Take five seconds, Think about my crew, Who am I..P.O.D. Listen my cry, what do you hear?. Live my breathe, how do you feel?. Look at my soul, Who do you see?. Imagine a moment, YOU DON'T KNOW ME!. Take five seconds &amp; listen, open your mind never met me face to face, but persist to talk behind my back, in fact, you ever even seen me never been where I'm from, Where I'm at, or ever be me so check me, test me, I ain't got nothing to lose been down since the beginning, still payin' dues so uh!. Drop what you're doing, stop &amp; stare at me not who you are, 'cause you're too scared to be. Listen my cry, what do you hear?. Live my breathe, how do you feel?. Look at my soul, Who do you see?. Imagine a moment, YOU DON'T KNOW ME!. Reap what I've sown, it all goes along with my past. It's not the first time I've struggled. and it wont be the last no class, when you talk about another how can you say, you love me, when you hate your brother you smother, but my faith keeps me driven. the only difference between me and you, holmes, is that I'm forgiven I got your back, if your down with my crew I looked to Him, so I don't answer you. Listen my cry, what do you hear?. Live my breathe, how do you feel?. Look at my soul, Who do you see?. Imagine a moment, YOU DON'T KNOW ME!. Who am I, I am you 8x. I'm just like you 4x. Listen my cry and tell me, I know you hear me Live my breath &amp; tell me, I know you feel me Look at my soul &amp; tell me, I know you see me I know you love me.     </segment1>
