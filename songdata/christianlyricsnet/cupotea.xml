		<segment1>&quot;KICK START&quot; - his overdue life as a star. waiting tables hadn't done that so far. &quot;SPOTLIGHT&quot; - a dream for many a year. the leather jacket, Jimmy's ever ready stage wear </segment1>
		<segment2>sorry I'm not your cup o'tea. but I don't mind. Yeah, I said I don't mind. at least I know you're thinking about me. yeah, I don't mind. yeah, I said I don't mind </segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;GOOD STUFF, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY HEAR!&quot;. Mumbled something `bout &quot;PEARLS IN A PIG'S EAR&quot;. &quot;OLD SCHOOL&quot; thirty two and knowing it all. who wants to listen to a single-sided phone call? </segment3>
		<segment4>sorry I'm not your cup o'tea. but I don't mind. yeah, I said I don't mind. at least I know you're thinking about me. yeah, I don't mind. yeah, I said I don't mind </segment4>
		<segment5>bring it all into perspective. the tongue will steer the ship ahoy. spark up a flame. feel the pain of habanero sauce. a word's forever. when we speak we set `em free. so watch your mouth. and you be careful what you say, Jimmy </segment5>
		<segment6>sorry I'm not your cup o'tea. but I don't mind. yeah, I said I don't mind. at least I know you're thinking about me. yeah, I don't mind. ahh, maybe I do mind    </segment6>
