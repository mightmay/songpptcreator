		<segment1>How I love Your works. My God, My King. How I love Your works. My God, My King</segment1>
		<segment2>Your Name rings on the plains. Like a not so distant train. And Love and history are near. In the flowers that you make. The flowers that you make</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS</segment3>
		<segment4>Because I'll never hold the picture. Of the whole horizon in my view. Because I'll never rip the night in two. It makes me wonder. Who am I, Who am I, Who am I. And great are you</segment4>
		<segment5>How I love Your Word. My God, My King. How I love Your Word. My God, My King</segment5>
		<segment6>Your love cuts through these pages to my heart. As you grieve our sins, right from the start. And sacrifice and paradise are in. The plans that you made, The plans that you made. Chorus (2x)    </segment6>
