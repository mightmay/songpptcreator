		<segment1>Pack a bag go let the world know how you feel about it. Hit the party let the people scream and shout about it. No doubt about it no reason for you to pout about it. If you don't get it then you probably live your life without it. So get it it and take a second just to think it through. It's not a secret you're on schedule for a rendezvous. But who knew the 'Who's Who of Voodoo'. Would be you the day you get your verdict asking for a redo</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>Get up, Get up we never get down. (KJ) We be seekin' freaks out from the underground. Stay up, Stay up we never let down. (KJ) We keep it rockin' 'til you all come around</segment3>
		<segment4>Ready or not here we come, come to seek you out. Cause you can only hide for so long in the underground. Until you're found and you scream aloud in the crowd. That you're down and you're never turning back around. So shut down the ways we'll call the days of old. And get down with the freaks that are livin' bold. Stay up we livin' life fortississimo. KJ we get the freaks gotta let 'em know</segment4>
		<segment5>KJ-52. Now excuse me. Now what I speak is for my freaks and when I come forth. And I get down like I'm jumpin' off the eighth floor. What's the dealy for realy what you ashamed for. You're the reason that He came for and His blood poured. So behold He stands at the door and just knocks. But you be standin' at the door with the door locked. So it's a sure shot that in the whole spot and whole. Lotta y'all need to take heed the words that we drop    </segment5>
