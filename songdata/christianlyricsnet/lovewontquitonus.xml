		<segment1>Verse 1: You've been hurt, and you're jaded. You're telling me that your faith is fading fast. You wonder what it's even worth. You've got doubts, and I get it. 'Cause I've been in the place you're livin'. Scared that love will only get you burned </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Don't quit on Love 'cause you're broken. Don't quit on hope. You're not hopeless. You know the sun will rise again. This is not the end. I know this complicated world gets you down, but don't give up. Don't give up. Don't quit on Love. 'Cause love. Won't quit on us. Love. Won't quit on us </segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: He's felt what you're feelin'. Feelin' like you'll only be defeated if you choose to let Him in this time. But do you really wanna have control, when everything's tellin' you to let. It go and give Him. Your plans. Your dreams. Your life </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: Don't quit on Love 'cause you're broken. Don't quit on hope. You're not hopeless. You know the sun will rise again. This is not the end. I know this complicated world gets you down, but don't give up. Don't give up. Don't quit on Love. 'Cause Love. Won't quit on us. Love. Won't quit on us </segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: Hold on. Hold on. Be strong. Hope is coming for you. Hold on. Hold on. Don't stop believing. Don't quit on Love 'cause He won't quit on you </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: Don't quit on Love 'cause you're broken. Don't quit on hope. You're not hopeless. You know the sun will rise again. This is not the end. I know this complicated world gets you down, but don't give up. Don't give up. Don't quit on Love. 'Cause Love. Won't quit on us. Love. Won't quit on us    </segment6>
