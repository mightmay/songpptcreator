		<segment1>I tried to live this life on my own. But emptiness was beating down the door. Yea I rose up like a flood. Until my dying days were done. They are no more</segment1>
		<segment2>Nothing makes sense without you. It's like waking up in the dark. I didn't have a song. Until you came along</segment2>
		<segment3>Falling in love with you was easy. You were always mean to have my heart. I was broken all to pieces. You were there to be the missing part</segment3>
		<segment4>Nothing makes sense without you. It's like waking up in the dark. I didn't have a song. Until you came..</segment4>
		<segment5>And I never wanna go back. To the way things were before. You saved me and you made me yours</segment5>
		<segment6>Now nothing makes sense without you. It's like waking up in the dark. I didn't have a song. Until you came along</segment6>
		<segment7>Now nothing makes sense without you. It's like waking up in the dark. I didn't have a song. Until you came along    </segment7>
