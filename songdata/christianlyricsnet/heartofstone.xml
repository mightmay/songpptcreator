		<segment1>All the blood in their souls pour out, look for something in the dark. Blinded they find nothing another lust given in, another trust shut within. Listen to him speak so holy, father God, I'm saved. That's fall that matters let the rest burn in hell. Preach false, a sin is a sin, doesn't give you the right to condemn then to hell. they know their wrongs you don't have to tell them their faults. Once you were a sinner how would you like it. if someone laughed at you because of your wrongs?. I'm not here to accept their sings but I'm here to show them love within. Listen to him speak so holy, Father God I'm saved. That's all that really matters let the rest burn in hell. No Matter how hard you try you can't convince me that you represent Christ. No more, I'm fed up with this.. you've already killed too many souls. It's time you wake up and see the truth Christian, I stand no afraid of my beliefs. Learn to love your enemies, to open their eyes you must be willing to die. Look at your own wrongs before you look at someone else's. You want to save souls or put souls to death. Giving our savior a bad name, giving me a bad name. You're so wrong with your beliefs, sit in church every week, but never do you help the weak. This is time to take back what's ours, not to give the world what's ours    </segment1>
