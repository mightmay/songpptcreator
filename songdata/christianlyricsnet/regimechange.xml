		<segment1>Build it up, I'll tear it down. My finger in the strings connected to your hands. I dance the mockery, a theme of decadence. Now I am sinking in this violence. This time, emancipation is my right</segment1>
		<segment2>This is what I want, for you to die. This is what I want, to be alive</segment2>
		<segment3>Scene of complacency, an apathetic mind. But when it's brought to light, I see a king on a borrowed throne. Right now, the violence taking over. This time, regimes are changing in my mind</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm so sorry, my old friend, I'm leaving you tonight. So caught in this moment, the last breath of your life.     </segment4>
