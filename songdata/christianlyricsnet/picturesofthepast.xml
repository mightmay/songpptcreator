		<segment1>I think it's time. That I forgive you. Oh, I've kept this inside. Long enough. Remember the 5th grade. And all the jokes you made. At my expense. Oh I've wanted to trip you in the hall. And watch your books fall ever since. And I can't remember your last name. But your first was Steven. If you ever hear this song. Do you think we could call it even?</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Cause love doesn't keep a record of wrongs. It lets go, it moves on. Oh cause time goes by too fast. To keep painting pictures of the past</segment2>
		<segment3>I've got one of those brains. That can't remember where I set my keyes. Oh, but I could recite every hurtful word ever spoken to me. I say I forgive and I try to forget</segment3>
		<segment4>But it's like getting caught in a rainstorm. And tryin' not to get wet. Oh, and I've weathered my share of wrongs. By God's grace I am slowly dryin' off. Yeah, yeah, yeah</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE: And I've carefully compiled. A list of names and faces. And I can point out the scars that each one gave me, yeah. And I've plotted my revence fueled by these mental images. But today I'm thowing all my pictures away. Yeah, yeah</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS: Cause love doesn't keep a record of wrongs. It lets go, it moves on. Oh, cause time goes by way too fast. To keep painting pictures of the past. Stop painting pictures of the past. Stop painting pictures. Stop painting pictures.. of the past. Yeah, yeah    </segment6>
