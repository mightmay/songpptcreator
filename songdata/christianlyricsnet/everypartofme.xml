		<segment1>The way You know me. The way You love me. It's so natural. Can't remember me. without You </segment1>
		<segment2>Show everybody. The You that I see. Every day with You. Is like a glimpse of eternity (because) </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. What I see through Your eyes. is the promise of forever. Look over my shoulder and You're always there. Come whatever. And I want You to know I never. Take for granted what I have. There's no (wherever I go). No mistakin' (now that I now). I'm sayin'. (There's a part of You) There's a part of You. In every part of me ( In every part of me) </segment3>
		<segment4>Ain't no deceivin'. Couldn't conceal it. Quick am I breathin'. Just gets better all the time </segment4>
		<segment5>The way I know You. The way I love You. Feels so natural. You reach me and I feel the fire </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus. What I see through Your eyes. is the promise of forever. Look over my shoulder and You're always there. Come whatever. And I want You to know I never. Take for granted what I have. There's no (wherever I go). No mistakin' (now that I now). I'm sayin'. (There's a part of You) There's a part of You. In every part of me ( In every part of me) </segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge. Being real and just kickin' back. I know in Your love there's no lack. And no one ever could argue that. They can try but they won't get nowhere. Fast as the earth turns around. Heaven stands still for right now. You in my heart and no other sound. Anyway, anyhow </segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus. What I see through Your eyes. is the promise of forever. Look over my shoulder and You're always there. Come whatever. And I want You to know I never. Take for granted what I have. There's no (wherever I go). No mistakin' (now that I now). I'm sayin'. (There's a part of You) There's a part of You. In every part of me ( In every part of me) </segment8>
		<segment9>The way You love me.     </segment9>
