		<segment1>I can only imagine what it will be like. When I walk by your side. I can only imagine. What my eyes will see. When your face is looking at me</segment1>
		<segment2>Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?. Will I dance for you Jesus?. When all of youll be still imagine hm.. I can only imagine</segment2>
		<segment3>I can only imagine all creations bow down. The whole universes saying your name out loud. I can only imagine. All of broken lifes resurrecting in the healing light</segment3>
		<segment4>Surrounded by your glory, what will my heart feel?. Will I dance for you Jesus?. When all of youll be still. Will I stand in Your presence?. Unto my knees will I fall?. Will I sing hallelujah?. Will I be able to speak it all?. I can only imagine. Oh, I can only imagine</segment4>
		<segment5>Surrounded by forgiveness, what will my heart feel?. Will I dance for you Jesus?. When all of youll be still. Will I stand in Your presence?. Unto my knees will I fall?. Will I sing hallelujah?. Will I be able to speak it all?. I can only imagine. Oh, I can only imagine. I can only I can only huu.. I can only imagine. I can only Imagine. Just imagine    </segment5>
