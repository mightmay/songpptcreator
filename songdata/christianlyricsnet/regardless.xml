		<segment2>I came to Jesus on my knees. Ashamed to lift my head&amp;#8232;. I tried so hard to find the words. This is what I said&amp;#8232;. There's so much wrong in my life. That I can not make it right.&amp;#8232;. I've been on this road so long. I can not see the light.&amp;#8232;. All I really need is someone who loves me. And can show me the way.&amp;#8232;. Before I could finish, I heard Him say</segment2>
