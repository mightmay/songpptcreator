		<segment1>All seems wasted now you comb your hair. While your eyes search for a backdoor to get out. All you could do was to leave your deeds at the door. As you entered this room of sickness and doubt</segment1>
		<segment2>But I saw you put down the memories in your coat just before. Now you want to drink but need someone to pour. To pour your heart out</segment2>
		<segment3>This time. You know this is real. When you're scared to reveal. This time. Could you leave this now. Even if you knew how. This time. Looking over your shoulder. You have become older. This time. Are you afraid to die?</segment3>
		<segment4>With nothing left the pressure is off. To become all you needed to survive. With a color black you would not be blessed. In a church that decides color and puts a price. On a paradise you now seem to know so well. But I know. I see Jesus in your eyes so kiss the sky and leave this now. Now I have seen what grace looks like</segment4>
		<segment5>This time. You know this is real. When you're scared to reveal. This time. Could you leave this now. Even if you knew how. This time. Looking over your shoulder. You have become older. This time. Are you afraid to die?</segment5>
		<segment6>We had an intimate talk. With God you and I. Me with my words. And you in silence. All you said was. I liked that. But I saw Jesus in your eyes</segment6>
		<segment7>This time. You know this is real. When you have nothing more to reveal. This time. Would you leave this now. Even if you knew how. This time. Looking over your shoulder. You have become older. This time. You're not afraid to die.     </segment7>
