		<segment1>You think I'm better off by acting just like you. I tell you what I wanna be and what I wanna do. But you say you don't care its not good enough for you. You think I should start over with something new. You think I'm better off if I act just like you. But I do what I want and I do what you hate. I make my own decisions do what I wanna do. And I do what I want and I do what you hate. You think I'm better off by acting just like you. I tell you what I wann be you tell me I'm a fool. and I say I don't care what you say. I'll do what I want to do anyway.     </segment1>
