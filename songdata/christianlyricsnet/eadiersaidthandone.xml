		<segment1>No one here is innocent as far as I can see. It happens each and everyday condoned by you and me. Is if right to take the very best only for yourself. Thinking of no other one only of yourself. </segment1>
		<segment2>I was lost then I was found. But my selfishness still brings me down. Was blind but now I see. This selfishness in front of me </segment2>
		<segment3>Now I'm thinking about doing the right thing everday. It's really hard to do but it's easy to say. By myself I fall but in him I stand. Everytime I doubt he shows me again    </segment3>
