		<segment1>Were not the first, wiping ice from the blinders eyes. We dont know how long this will tide us over. See results divide into very clear realities. You couldnt set them further apart and I. cant ever look far enough.</segment1>
		<segment2>Reach up to the highest point or brought down to the lowest level. The balance will allow. Split and substain in front of me. Build up the attainable, already set up to fail. The balance will allow. Split and substain in front of me.</segment2>
		<segment3>Im worn right out asking for solutions I dont need. See the answers just arent good enough, and of course. after a while Ive made a new realization. As mush as I gain today, spills out even in a different way. Well watch essentials dislocate, stripped away. Am I working in vain?</segment3>
		<segment4>The balance will allow losing unexpectedly. I know the balance will allow finding and recovering. Balance will allow. Resolutions finding me. Balance will allow. Resolutions finding me, finding me. Balance will allow. Balance will allow. Balance will allow. Resolutions finding me.</segment4>
		<segment5>When it rains it pours. See the floodgates opening. Desolate, dry spells. When theres nothing happening, The balance will allow. Split and substain in front of me. When it rains it pours. See the floodgates opening. Desolate, dry spells. When theres nothing happening, The balance will allow. Split and substain in front of me.</segment5>
		<segment6>Reach up to the highest point or brought down to the lowest level. The balance will allow. Split and substain in front of me. Build up the attainable, already set up to fail. The balance will allow. Split and substain in front of me.     </segment6>
