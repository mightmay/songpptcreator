		<segment1>it happened all so fast heavy with sleep my eyes closed. the next thing i remember was crawling out from the car and. seeing you lying there. holdin your head kissing you for the last time. the taste of blood on my lips. your clothes torn apart perfumed with gas. it seems like it was yesterday when the rain poured down. i can still hear your screams as if it was happening all over again. saturday, december 4th that night woudl become a grave. that would crush my heart. joy and laughter exchanged for grief and silence. searching for so long to fnd you and the moment. you were ripped from me. laying here on this empty shelf never to be read again. in these pages lies every memory of you. the wind blew your heart over my eyes and i slept for days. praying not to awake, but these dreams can only last so long. facing the day looking through these tears. i'll always look back and remember that night as you lay there. looking over that casket seeing your face times of past rushing. touching your cold hand wishing it woudl touch me back. you look so pretty lying thee just like the first day we met. it feels so real like olt times but it's nothing, it's nothing. i can taste the stale air on my tongue and death lights up the sky. hope finds itself it and end stopping at my thoughts. pictures of you help bring back the tears. walking in the present but living in the past. how much longer will i embrace sorrow?. from the moment you entered my life. my whole outlook on love would change. you brought out a happiness i didn't even know i had. and now you've gone leaving without a goodbye. that glass heart that rested in my chest has fallen and shattered. here on lord is the remains of a broken heart. for i have faith you can give me joy and life again. death has fallen but love covers me. heaven is now home to my angel of love    </segment1>
