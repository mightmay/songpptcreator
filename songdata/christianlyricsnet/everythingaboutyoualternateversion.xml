		<segment1>Be my light in the darkened room. I'm on my face and I'm calling you. I can't fathom all you've done for me. Everytim it finds me on my knees </segment1>
		<segment2>Like sinlight in the winter cold </segment2>
		<segment3>Everything about you, it takes my breath. Away..Hallelujah. I tried this once without you and it was my. Great mistake..Hallelujah </segment3>
		<segment4>Questions fade when you invade. You chase all my fears away. With your love in my atmosphere. All confusion disappears </segment4>
		<segment5>And nothing but your truth remains </segment5>
		<segment6>Questions fade, you remain. You are color on a page of white, bright. Like eyes beneath black lights. Like a glowing city on the plains, you call. My name </segment6>
		<segment7>Hallelujah     </segment7>
