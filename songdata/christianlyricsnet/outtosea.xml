		<segment1>Fourteen hours a day. Fourteen days in two weeks. A fortnight out to sea. I'm far from home, alright by me. Off the coast of Milan. Then the Ivory Keys. I put my back into. My distancing the distant seas</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll sail away, I'll sail away. Forever and forever. Hoist the jig, skip the rope. Do whatever you do. To get me into the blue. Alright by me</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey Mamasita. Ain't it good. Ain't it wonderful?. Hey Mamasita. Ain't it great. When you're worlds away?</segment3>
		<segment4>Getting further away. Putting distance between. Myself and all the shelves. Of smarmy, charmy human creeps. Interruptions are gone. Lost in a reverie. Nothing but wind, waves, and inspiration. For my peeps</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll sail away, I'll sail away. Forever and forever. Hoist the jig, skip the rope. Do whatever you do. To get me into the blue. Alright by me</segment5>
		<segment6>Hey Mamasita. Ain't it good. Ain't it wonderful?. Hey Mamasita. Ain't it great. When you're worlds away?</segment6>
		<segment7>Now I am guided by the stars. And by the red sun. I go where I want. For good or ill. Please winds blow whither you will. Whither you will. Whither you will</segment7>
		<segment8>Hey Mamasita. Ain't it good. Ain't it wonderful?. Hey Mamasita. Ain't it great. When you're worlds away?</segment8>
		<segment9>When you're worlds away. And things are great. When you're worlds away. And things are great </segment9>
