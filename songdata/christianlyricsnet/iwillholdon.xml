		<segment1>My times are in Your hands. I know Ill never understand. But Ill trust in You. Sometimes my heart grows cold. Im sorry when I take control. How Im needing You</segment1>
		<segment2>Even when I fall. You help me stand. Even when Im lost You take my hand. I will hold on. I will hold on. I will hold on. I can trust in You. My life is in Your hands. You hold the key to who I am. And Ill trust in You. Sometimes my heart is stone. Im sorry when I walk alone. How Im needing You    </segment2>
