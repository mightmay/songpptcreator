		<segment1>Father finally I'm broken. Stretched so thin that I can hardly move. And all that I have left are the promises You've spoken to me. Father finally I'm shattered. A hollow shell of what I once thought true. And there is nothing left of things that used to matter to me</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, take me now. Cause I have got to get away from here somehow</segment2>
		<segment3>Father don't be long tonight, I just need You by my side. I'm tearing out my insides and I've needed You alright. Let me look into Your eyes, All I need is You tonight. Hold me 'til I'm fast asleep and things will be alright</segment3>
		<segment4>Father finally I'm happy. Where my sin was great Your grace abounds. And all that I have left is the hope that You have given to me. Lord take me now. Cause everything's alright when I'm with You somehow</segment4>
		<segment5>And I'll wait for You tonight. I'll be still and know tonight, so Father don't be long tonight    </segment5>
