		<segment1>You're thinking, You're thinking. You want to do what's right. I'm waiting I'm waiting. Just trying to stay alive</segment1>
		<segment2>Here you go, I see you moving. Here you come, my hand is raised. Come and lift me from the pit and. Lead me on to better days</segment2>
		<segment3>You're thinking, You're thinking. You want to do what's right. I'm waiting, still waiting. Surely God's love is not blind</segment3>
		<segment4>Here you go, I see you moving. Here you come, my hand is raised. Come and lift me from the pit and. Lead me on to better days</segment4>
		<segment5>If you see me please don't walk on by. If you hear me calling, please don't ignore my cry. Will you cross the borders to save me . Will you cross the borders &amp; save someone like me</segment5>
		<segment6>Every action has reactions. Every star must shine it's light. You have seen what true love looks like. Now go and do the same likewise </segment6>
		<segment7>If you see me please don't walk on by. If you hear me calling, please don't ignore my cry. Will you cross the borders to save me . Will you cross the borders &amp; save someone like me    </segment7>
