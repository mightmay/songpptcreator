		<segment1>three sleepless nights. this isn't how it's supposed to be. but you're so good at taking your time. to give back to me</segment1>
		<segment2>I will wait for you forever. if you would just ask me. I thought that I could change you. but you changed me</segment2>
		<segment3>but it doesn't feel right. holding someone else's hand. together on phone lines. and living at two opposite ends</segment3>
		<segment4>it scares me to think that you could find takers. other than me and better than me. but your head is elsewhere. and I'm talking enough for both of us. when will you see it's not so easy for me</segment4>
		<segment5>you careless and whispered. insulting and bruising. and I thought that you said. things were improving. these laces are untied. but my feet are walking away. (I fall from your eyes. Your eyes I trusted. You said forever)</segment5>
		<segment6>I never thought you could say these words. is this really happening. (don't say that we can still be friends)</segment6>
		<segment7>erase my name from this page. how can you take all these days. (what is inside me, what have I done). and throw them away, (is this the only way that you will notice me). as I sit here waiting for you. (dead words for closed ears, all this is sung for you). I stay up nights. (if you are still pretending this is what's right). until stars leave the sky. (why can you look at me can you only see). knowing what my dreams can take away. (sides, your side, can take away)</segment7>
		<segment8>walk away from me. this night is done    </segment8>
