		<segment1>Dreaming comes so easily. 'Cause it's all that I've known. True love is a fairy tale. I'm damaged, so how would I know. I'm scared and I'm alone. I'm ashamed. And I need for you to know. I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say. And you can't take back what you've taken away. 'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me. I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say. And you can't take back what you've taken away. 'Cause I feel you, I feel you near me. Healing comes so painfully. And it chills to the bone. Will anyone get close to me?. I'm damaged, as I'm sure you know. There's mending for my soul. An ending to this fear. Forgiveness for a man who was stronger. 'Cause I was just a little girl, but I can't go back    </segment1>
