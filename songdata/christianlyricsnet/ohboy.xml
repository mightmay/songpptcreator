		<segment1>All my love, all my kissing. You don't know what you've been missing. Oh Boy - Oh Boy. When you're with me. The world can see that you were meant for me. All my life, I've been waiting. Tonight there'll be no hesitating. Oh Boy - Oh Boy. Stars are peering, shadows falling. You can hear my heart calling. A little bit of loving makes everything right. I'm gonna see my baby tonight. Oh Boy - Oh Boy.     </segment1>
