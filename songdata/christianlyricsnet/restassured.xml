		<segment1>I'm already sorry, for all of the harm that is to come. I'm already thankful for the man I know that you'll become. So, look up and laugh, we'll cross that finish line together. Sleep tight tonight child and I will be watching over you. Rest assured. God will be watching over you. All you need to learn. I'll keep you safe from harm. I'd do all it takes. I'd lay down my life as long as I know you'll be all right. I give you all my victories, cause without you I'm not quite me. Rest assured I said I'd never leave.     </segment1>
