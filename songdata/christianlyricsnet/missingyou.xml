		<segment1>I don't want to say goodbye. I can see the fear inside your eyes. It's so hard to walk away</segment1>
		<segment2>I know that this feels like the end. Life never seems to let you win. But I'll be back someday</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm already missing you. But I'm not even gone. In time we'll be together again. And it won't be long</segment3>
		<segment4>Now everything goes up and down. And the world keeps spinning round and round. And still you're waiting there</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll try to make it another night. And dream of you when I close my eyes. Cause I'll be back someday. Just hold it in. Don't let it go. You'll always live. Inside my soul    </segment5>
