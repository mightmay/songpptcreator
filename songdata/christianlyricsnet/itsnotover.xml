		<segment1>As we walk along the road. We laugh about the past and how quickly we forget. It's not exactly what we say. But the things that we had meant and let it slip away</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: It's not over it's not over. We are born again. Into creation an evolution of our spiritual way. A new day a place where we belong</segment2>
		<segment3>As we sit inside this room. Hoping something better soon. How badly I regret. It's not exactly what I did. But the things still left undone. It doesn't have to be too late</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>A place where we belong</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS x2     </segment6>
