		<segment1>(Verse 1). Listen, gather 'round. I found something that you can use. And if you listen, well, I'm here to tell you, you cannot lose. A simple song, simple melody, to remind you that you can be. The greatest ever, defeated never, even though sometimes you may lose</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Yes you can. you can do anything if you try, just try. Yes you can. but you have to believe. and rely on what you have inside. You can make it through your trials, for your trials will just make you strong. You can do anything, yes you can, oh</segment2>
		<segment3>(Verse 2). Teach your children well, it's time to tell them just who they are. Train them as they go. to let them know that they can go far. Oh my brother why do you wait, tomorrow might just be too late. For God gave the provision, made the decision, you can do all things through your faith</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>(Vamp). I can, I can, yes I can do anything. No matter what if you can just conceive it, if you believe it, then you can achieve it     </segment5>
