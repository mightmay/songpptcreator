		<segment1>You may find me in the midnight. Fallen down upon my knees. Or riding out another storm. Praying for some peace. Even when I feel alone. Jesus, this I know. You will never leave me. You will always be the one. Who calms the raging sea. You will never leave me. You will always be the one. Whos holding onto me. You may lead me to the desert. Where Im empty and afraid. Wandering this nothingness. Thirsting for the rain. I will not give into fear. Cause Lord, I know Youre here. You will never leave me. You will always be the one. Who calms the raging sea. You will never leave me. You will always be the one. Whos holding onto me. Though my heart is breaking. And my faith is shaking. Standing strong cause I believe. You have promised me, Youll never leave. You will never leave me. You will always be the one. Who calms the raging sea. You will never leave me. You will always be the one. Whos holding onto me    </segment1>
