		<segment1>Knocked off my feet. The earth moved beneath. The edge of a dream and a nightmare</segment1>
		<segment2>Open the door. Fell through the floor. Slipped through the cracks into nowhere</segment2>
		<segment3>So tell me where were you. When everything fell down like thunder. I begged you to pull me through. I couldnt get out from under</segment3>
		<segment4>I took the fall. I took it all. Last night was just an illusion</segment4>
		<segment5>Cut me, I bleed. Feel me in need. I finally broke in the pressure</segment5>
		<segment6>So tell me where were you. When everything fell down like thunder. I begged you to pull me through. I couldnt get out from under</segment6>
		<segment7>Left me for dead inside my head. Couldnt you see that I was still breathing?. Screaming, I reached for you. I couldnt get out from under</segment7>
		<segment8>Where were you?. I reached for you. The pressure broke me down</segment8>
		<segment9>Where were you?. I reached for you. The pressure broke me</segment9>
		<segment10>Where were you?. The pressure broke me. Where were you?. The pressure broke me. Where were you?. I reached for you</segment10>
		<segment11>Pressure [x3].     </segment11>
