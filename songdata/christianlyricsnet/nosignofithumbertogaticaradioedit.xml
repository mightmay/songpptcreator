		<segment1>It's a long wait at the gate. Just to glimpse your fate. Just to see whether it all works out. It's a long road, a heavy load. You gotta really want to go. And just let the others walk around, you now</segment1>
		<segment2>Up and down again but this time it's different. It took some waiting to straighten out the bend. In and out of luck, yeah at times it was difficult. I got a new life baby, it takes some getting used to but</segment2>
		<segment3>No sign of any rain. My skies are clear today. I keep bracing for that hit. But there's not sign of it</segment3>
		<segment4>No obstacles in sight. My skies are clear tonight. (My skies are full of light). I keep thinking, I might see that cloud arrive. Oh, but there's no sign of it, no sign of it</segment4>
		<segment5>And as I look around, it's all new ground. The leaves on the trees touch down. But I'm above weightless as a dream. It's been a long road, a heavy load. I just simply had to go. Had to get here hard as it's been</segment5>
		<segment6>In and out of luck, yeah at time it was difficult. I got a new life baby, it takes some getting used to but</segment6>
		<segment7>No sign of any rain. My skies are clear today. I keep bracing for that hit. But there's not sign of it</segment7>
		<segment8>No obstacles in sight. My skies are clear tonight. (My skies are full of light). I keep thinking, I might see that cloud arrive. Oh, but there's no sign of it, no sign of it.     </segment8>
