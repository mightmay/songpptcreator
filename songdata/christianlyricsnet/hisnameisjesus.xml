		<segment1>A world full of people. In a world full of darkness. Constantly searching. Searching for truth</segment1>
		<segment2>So shout it from the roof tops. The truth has come</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: His name is Jesus. And He loves you. If you listen you can hear Him call your name. His name is Jesus. He gave His life for you. And to know him is to never be the same</segment3>
		<segment4>So many choices. So much confusion. No sense of direction. Don't know which way to turn</segment4>
		<segment5>The Father paved the way for us. It's through his Son</segment5>
		<segment6>For the one who is broken. The one who is lost. There is life to be found. At the foot of an old rugged cross    </segment6>
