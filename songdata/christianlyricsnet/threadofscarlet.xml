		<segment1>In the garden when we fell. You were there covering our shame. You were there. In the desert wandering manna fell. Emanuel, O God when we fell. You were there</segment1>
		<segment2>The thread of scarlet, woven in time. For our redemption, the Son of David died. That we might live</segment2>
		<segment3>Willingly the sinless One took our sin. Upon Himself and we hid our face. &quot;Why have you forsaken me?&quot;. Was His cry before He died. Were you there?. Can you see?</segment3>
		<segment4>The thread of scarlet, woven in time. For our redemption, attired in Christ. A robe of splendor that is crimson and white. He paid our ransom that we might live. That we might live</segment4>
		<segment5>Holy Lamb of God. The Son of David. Holy Lamb of God. He paid our ransom. Holy Lamb of God. The Lord our Righteousness. Holy Lamb of God. Jesus did die that we might live. That we might live    </segment5>
