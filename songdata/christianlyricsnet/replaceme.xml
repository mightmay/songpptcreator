		<segment1>Broken. And so tired of myself. I just give up. Cause I won't make it in my own strength. I want you to be pleased with what I say and do. Lord I'm all yours. Cause you can do with me more than I can do</segment1>
		<segment2>So Lord here I am. I'm coming to you. I'm sick of my ways. I wanna be new. I'm asking you to replace me. Lord, replace me with you. Just as I am. I come to you. I'm sick of my ways. Make me brand new. I'm asking you to replace me. Yea, replace me with you</segment2>
		<segment3>I've seen all that can do. And its nothing in comparison to you Lord. Do so, impress me (you're amazing). You're all that I will ever need and more. Cause I've reached my potential. (claps) Bravo ( yes) I even got a standing O. But now I'm ready to be made over again Lord. Take me, replace me</segment3>
		<segment4>. Lord here I am. I'm coming to you</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm tired of my ways. I wanna be new. Lord replace me. Please Lord, replace me wiith you. Just as I am. I'm running to you. I'm changing my ways. Make me brand new. I want you to replace me. (Cause I don't wanna be me no more). Replace me with you</segment5>
		<segment6>No more ( no more of me). No more of me. But more Lord. More Lord. More Lord of you. (repeat)</segment6>
