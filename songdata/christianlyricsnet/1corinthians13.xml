		<segment1>What if I could move mountains. And gave all I had to the poor?. Would it mean a thing?. Would it mean a thing if I don't have love?. What if I used all the gifts. And gave my body to the flame?. Would it mean a thing?. Would it mean a thing if I don't have love? </segment1>
		<segment2>And when I pass through that veil. I know perfection comes. The chains will come off. The walls will fall down. The scales will drop. And I'll see Him face to face </segment2>
		<segment3>Love came to earth so we'd see. A different way to live and grow. Self-seeking in nothing. To show us what it means to walk in love. To show us how to always trust. To persevere and always hope. Give thanks in everything. To show us what it means to walk in love </segment3>
		<segment4>Love is patient, love is kind. It doesn't envy, doesn't bind. It means everything. It means everything when you have love     </segment4>
