		<segment1>You're down all the way down. Cant shake the feeling. Youve tried. You learned how to hide. Youve got your reasons</segment1>
		<segment2>I bet. Youre full of regret. Sweet and bitter. Please consider</segment2>
		<segment3>Sore eyes. Whats up with that face. Think we can trace these lines. Back to fine. Im sure. Youve been here before. Sore eyes. Such a sight to see. If I can bring that light. Back to your eyes to stay. What would you say. Instead of walking away</segment3>
		<segment4>No sign. of roses or wine. But youve got my attention. No lines. All out of rhymes. I just wanna hold you</segment4>
		<segment5>I bet. Ill make you forget. Loves not bitter. Reconsider</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Wipe away those sore eyes. You dont have to cry</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
