		<segment1>For so long I've been. Putting all my effort into you. My heart is bare. I've been looking everywhere for truth. You know.. Exactly what you're doing to me. But that's okay.. 'Cause I'm not playing anymore</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. I see what you're trying to hide. It didn't take me long to realize. You can't fool me with your disguise. I can see right through your lying eyes. You took your shot, pushed me around. You're never gonna take me down. So get out of my face.. With your masquerade</segment2>
		<segment3>Since I've moved on. Things are going everyway but wrong. It's a brighter day (across the sky). A new life, new friends. It's got me wondering where I've been. I was in a haze. I know.. That you're still bearing down on me. That's okay.. 'Cause I'm not running anymore</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>When it all comes down. You won't have control over me. You can shape it how you want. But you have been revealed</segment5>
		<segment6>You took your shot, pushed me around. You're never gonna take me down</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS    </segment7>
