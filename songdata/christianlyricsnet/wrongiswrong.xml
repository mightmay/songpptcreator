		<segment1>Did you ever sneak outside, when you weren't supposed to. Did you do those things you said you probably never would do. We all told white lies, and we've not been found out. Does it make a difference when your conscience giving you doubt. When do we draw the line,</segment1>
		<segment2>to say, what's wrong is wrong and nothing stands between. When did they take the line away?. What's wrong is wrong and nothing stands between. The things we often say, that make it seem o.k. When the possibilities are right there staring you down. No matter who you are, or what you're done so far, it's your responsibility our choice makes us who we are.     </segment2>
