		<segment1>Almost don't remember. The way it used to be. Where you used to whisper. You belonged to me. You belonged to me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I'm better off without you. Except for when I sleep. I'm better off without you. Besides the time I breath. I keep telling myself. Maybe one day I'll believe. That I'm better off without you. And I'd never think about you. I'm better off without you</segment2>
		<segment3>I saw you on the sidewalk. And I'd thought I caught your eye. And I wondered if you loved him. As I watched you both walk by. As I watched you just walk by</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Looking at a photograph of you, you're laughing. I'm standing by your side. I remember you were wearing my favorite perfume. How could you forget about the time you told me I was your only joy. Now when you want to smile, What do you do, what do you do</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
