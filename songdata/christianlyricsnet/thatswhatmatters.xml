		<segment1>I read about this guy once. He seemed to own the earth. As far as big shots go and people in the know.. well. He was definitely top of the list. Anything he wanted - he'd get it. Society's dream. Had lots of stuff - had lots of money. But you know what's funny?. He said it all was useless</segment1>
		<segment2>Meaningless - meaningless. He said &quot;Everything is meaningless.. A chase after the wind&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Don't wish for a better day. Be glad and use the one you're in. Fear God and do exactly what He says. That's what matters. All else fades like the flowers</segment3>
		<segment4>Well, he'd tried pleasure. But there was nothing in that. He built houses and gardens and parks. What good did it do?. Just got him more depressed. Meaningless - meaningless. He said &quot;Everything is meaningless.. But this is what I learned in all my years&quot;</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>Meaningless - meaningless. He said &quot;Everything is meaningless.. A chase after the wind&quot;</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>Meaningful - meaningful. Life holds new meaning. When God becomes the center of it all</segment8>
		<segment9>I read about another Man once. He came to save the earth. You know I got to meet Him, Jesus. He revolutionized my whole entire life</segment9>
		<segment10>CHORUS    </segment10>
