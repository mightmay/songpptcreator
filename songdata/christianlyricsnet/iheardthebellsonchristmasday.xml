		<segment1>I heard the bells on Christmas day. Their old familiar carols play. And wild and sweet the words repeat, Of peace on earth, good will to men.</segment1>
		<segment2>I thought how as the day had come, The belfries of all Christendom. Had roll'd along th' unbroken song. Of peace on earth, good will to men.</segment2>
		<segment3>Till ringing, singing on its way. The world revolved from night to day, A voice, a chime, a chant sublime. Of peace on earth, good will to men.</segment3>
		<segment4>In despair I bow'd my head: There is no peace on earth, I said, For hate is strong, and mocks the song. Of peace on earth, good will to men.</segment4>
		<segment5>I heard the bells on Christmas day. Yeah yeah. Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;. The wrong shall fail, the right prevail, With peace on earth, good will to men. Peace on earth, good will to men. Peace on earth, good will to men. Good will to men. I heard the bells on Christmas day. Peace on earth, good will to men.     </segment5>
