		<segment1>Believing the lies defines american. They don't realize their ignorance and sin. Democracy ain't real it's a fairytale. Anarchy now then spend the night in jail. I won't pretend that it ain't wrong. I won't just go along. Humanity is deseased. And the sickness has increased. For the people by the people. Who's considered people anyway?. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. So much for equal opportunity!    </segment1>
