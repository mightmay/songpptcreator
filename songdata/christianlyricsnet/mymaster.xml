		<segment1>The day You heard my plea, You looked right through me. You saw the pit I was in. And You came and pulled me out</segment1>
		<segment2>You set my feet upon a rock. And put a new song in my mouth. Then You called me Your own. And I'm never turning back</segment2>
		<segment3>I love my Master, I will not go free. I take Your name and live in liberty. My life is Yours forever. I'll serve You faithfully. I love my Master, I will not go free</segment3>
		<segment4>You're a love I've never known. And Your faithfulness has shown. No matter what I'm about. You always find me out</segment4>
		<segment5>And You lovingly remain. Age to age the same. And for all of my days. I will tell of Your ways.Your mighty ways</segment5>
		<segment6>Covenant Keeper. You are, You are. Merciful, Kindness. You are, You are. Passionate Father. You are, You are. Lifeblood redeemer. You are    </segment6>
