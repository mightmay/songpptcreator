		<segment1>Well, I was there when you were torn apart. Now, a piece of you is gone. Somehow, you wish that you could only find a little strength to carry on</segment1>
		<segment2>You've tried so hard to make it on your own. That your heart has come undone. So I am here to prove that I alone have the power to overcome</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't let your heart be troubled. This world will never keep you down. It will never keep you down</segment3>
		<segment4>So rise up, My friend. No, this will never be the end. So rise up, My friend. And live again</segment4>
		<segment5>I didn't want you to feel this way. It's not what life was meant to be. And so for you, My friend, I'll take your shame. You can give it all to Me</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause you've wrestled with demons everyday. And they've dragged you to your knees. But in your weakness, you will learn to find. That I will always be your strength</segment6>
		<segment7>In life or in death, through joy or regret. And all of the secret things you have done. No matter what comes, My friend. Nothing can keep you from the love of God.     </segment7>
