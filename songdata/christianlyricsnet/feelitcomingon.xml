		<segment1>Look at where we've come. a boy becomes a man. But for the first time in our lives. we come without a plan. Careful when you look. for my heart has leprosy. All I want is to see Jesus. just one touch and I'll be free</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, I feel, I feel it's coming on. When you call my name it feels like heaven</segment2>
		<segment3>Reach inside of me. deeper than before. Would you tear away this old man. bring peace to this old war. See your piercing eyes. burn me like a fire. If you have me I will run. to finish all that you've begun</segment3>
		<segment4>Hold me tonight, will you hold me tonight. Hold me tonight, it feels like heaven    </segment4>
