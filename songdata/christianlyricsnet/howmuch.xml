		<segment1>How much, how much. Do you really know. How much, how much. Well let me tell you. How much, how much. You are loved</segment1>
		<segment2>These words go out to anyone. Who's ever felt so unlovable. I'd just like to say to you. That lie is so not true. This message is for the broken down. They say you can't turn your life around. No matter what you do. Well that lie is so not true</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: How much, how much. Do you really know. How much, how much. Well let me tell you. How much, how much. You are loved</segment3>
		<segment4>Take the depths of the deepest ocean and go deeper. Take the top of the tallest tower and go higher. Take the best day that you've ever had. Try to imagine better than that. And it still don't come close. To how much you are loved</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't worry about what you've done. God's love goes out to everyone. And here's the wonderful, beautiful truth. That includes me and you. So let it find you where you are. Wrap it's arms around your weary heart. And all the love you're longing for. You'll find all that love and more</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: How much, how much. Do you really know. How much, how much. Well let me tell you. How much, how much. You are loved    </segment6>
