		<segment1>Pondering mysteries with a girlfriend over tazoberry tea. And an open Bible. There we were asking all the deep questions about. Life and love and God and and how it all came to be</segment1>
		<segment2>And why this and why that and why me and why not and why. And why do I think this way?. I wonder why</segment2>
		<segment3>I wonder, wonder, wonder why. I wonder, wonder why. All of these questions echo in my mind. I wonder, wonder why</segment3>
		<segment4>Throughout the rest of the conversation. I kept coming back to one thing I don't understand. Why would God leave all of heaven's glory. Just to come and live and die as a man?</segment4>
		<segment5>And why grace and why mercy and why. give it all for me, and why. And why does He love this way?. I wonder</segment5>
		<segment6>I wonder, wonder, wonder why. I wonder, wonder why. His love is so rich and deep and strong and wide. I wonder, wonder why</segment6>
		<segment7>I wonder, wonder, wonder why. I wonder, wonder why. All of these questions echo in my mind. I wonder, wonder why</segment7>
		<segment8>Every little thing that my mind can question. Just leads be back to one thing, God's love for me</segment8>
		<segment9>I wonder why Your love is so amazing. I just can't believe it. It's so rich and wide. I wonder why</segment9>
