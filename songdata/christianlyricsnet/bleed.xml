		<segment1>To every heart thats growing darker, colder and colder. The heart on the sleave is getting older and older. Harder and harder to beat. To every soul thats burning brighter and brighter. Riding the fire higher and higher. The heart on the sleave is growing darker and darker. Harder and harder to bleed </segment1>
		<segment2>And it won't be long now. And in time you'll find out. This heart is yours, let it bleed. And it won't be long now. And in time you'll find out. This heart is yours, let it bleed </segment2>
		<segment3>To every time i keep you waiting, holding and praying. The heart on that sleave is always building and breaking. Making it harder to see. To everything that doesn't matter, pulling you under, taking you over. The heart on the sleave is getting closer and closer. Just cut it open and bleed </segment3>
		<segment4>And it won't be long now. And in time you'll find out. This heart is yours, let it bleed. And it won't be long now. And in time you'll find out. This heart is yours, let it bleed </segment4>
		<segment5>Time.. Time takes away. Time gives you chances to come back again </segment5>
		<segment6>And it won't be long now. And in time you'll find out. This heart is yours, let it bleed. And it won't be long now. And in time you'll find out. This heart is yours, let it bleed.     </segment6>
