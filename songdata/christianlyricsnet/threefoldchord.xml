		<segment1>A thought of you and my heart swells;. A bond set in our eyes;. A simple peace from Jesus that always makes me cry. Maybe I'm just crazy or maybe you're the one. Ring around your finger, Three-fold chord has come undone, But I wanted you to stay. The reasons why you left, I'm not sure just why. The feelings were so cold as you said goodbye. Skin so pale and eyes so true, Your words are like a knife that cuts me through, But are we through?    </segment1>
