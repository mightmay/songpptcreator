		<segment1>poster child for the Christian single. dumped on more than a birdhouse shingle. tired of the same old crowd, she starts to. mingle where she don't belong. all God's bachelors hanging in a bunch. wolves in a Wool-lite beat 'em to the punch. score another knockout, barely bought her lunch. what went worng? </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. let's talk about real life. truth and consequences. and coming to our senses. and lies we'd best unlearn </segment2>
		<segment3>let's talk about real love. truth and propaganda. are you really gonna stand for. love that waits it's turn? </segment3>
		<segment4>I am the voice of the male agenda. sensitive, strong or shy, I tend to. act anyway that would possibly send you. somewhere we can be alone </segment4>
		<segment5>you're so sure I'm a would be Christian. suckered by the &quot;Untamed Heart&quot; condition. love that feminine intuition. seen that movie, too </segment5>
		<segment6>- Chorus - </segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge. Ok, ok, ok Â– you've got me figured out. I'm a sham. I never actually studied for the priesthood. I've had lots of destructive relationships, and I know I don't deserve someone like. You anyway. It's just, there's this. strange purity about You.. almost a. radiance. Maybe it comes from your. religious beliefs, I don't know. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you're unlike any woman I've ever met.. is it getting. hot in here? Can I help You. with that jacket? </segment7>
		<segment8>No, no, I know you've got to go.. oh! No, it's nothing, I've just got this. really bad kink in my neck.. you don't. suppose you could just massage it a. little, could you? </segment8>
		<segment9>- Chorus -.     </segment9>
