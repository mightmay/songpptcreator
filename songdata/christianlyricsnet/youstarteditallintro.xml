		<segment1>Im gonna believe. That we will see the kingdom come to earth. Im gonna believe. That signs and wonders follow hearts that burn. Im gonna believe. That sickness and inpoverty will cease. Im gonna believe. The power from the Heavens will release. Oh let your kingdom come on earth. And let your will be done. Yeah Light up the world with Your love. Rain down on our hearts like a flood. Our eyes will see the glory of God. Our eyes will see. Im gonna believe. That fathers and their children will unite. Im gonna believe. That marriage will not end without a fight. Im gonna believe. That churches will become your hands and feet. Im gonna believe. That acts of love and kindness will increase</segment1>
		<segment2>///As you light up///. As you light up the world. ////Send your glory, Send your glory////. Yeah Light up the world with Your love. Rain down on our hearts like a flood. Our eyes will see the glory of God. ////Our eyes will see the glory of God////    </segment2>
