		<segment1>There is a tremendous lover who would like to share. His wondrous love story with all those who would care. To listen to His still small voice He doesn't like to yell. and if you stop and take a chance I know you'll hear him tell </segment1>
		<segment2>I..your soul's friend. I..your soul's love. I..your soul's hope. I wanna be your soulmate, your soulmate </segment2>
		<segment3>The search it will continue leading you down many roads. it seems very attractive but in truth you're very alone. It's a trick of deception of clever placed distraction. leaving your spirit earth bound, never to soar </segment3>
		<segment4>I..your soul's friend. I..your soul's love. I..your soul's hope. I wanna be your soulmate, your soulmate </segment4>
		<segment5>There is a tremendous lover who would love to share. His wondrous love story with all those who would care </segment5>
		<segment6>I..your soul's friend. I..your soul's love. I..your soul's hope. I wanna be your soulmate, your soulmate     </segment6>
