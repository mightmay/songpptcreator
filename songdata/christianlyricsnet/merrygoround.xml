		<segment1>Didn't I just see your face. Last time that I was here. Eeren't you standing in that place. Was it you or me that disappeared. Did you tell me about your problem. Did I offer a solution. Maybe I could help you out. In the coming revolution</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). But I don't understand. When I reach for your hand. Why I can't hold it long. But you're hurting inside. So I'll get off this ride. Cause I don't want to be. Just another horse on the merry go round. I'm starting to see another course. Well it's time I got down</segment2>
		<segment3>Didn't know when I bought this ticket. To ride life's carousel. That I would be more than a minute. Gone away from the One I love so well. I was drawn to the main attraction. Mesmerized by it's appeal. Now it's all become distraction. how can I return to what is real</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). Still I don't understand... ... And it's time I got down. Time I got down. Time I got down    </segment4>
