		<segment1>Did you forget what's important in you life?. Somewhat confused, everthing is going wrong. Do you regret the decisions that you've made?. I don't expect a second chance to come along. You already found the book. With all the answers to all your questions. So take a closer look. You're in the turn land and I'm the intersection. Did you forget when you wakled out of my room. To turn off the light and say goodnight. Your answer's coming soon. I will admit in the end I'll be O.K. I think it safe to say, you don't know. If we're better off this way. Please don't forget how to laugh out loud. And be proud of yourself. I know you'll do what's right for you.     </segment1>
