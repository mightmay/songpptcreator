		<segment1>Chorus 1. Heaven and earth cry out Your name. Nations rise up and see Your face, And Your kingdom is established. As I live to know You more. Now I will never be the same. Spirit of God, my life You've changed, And I'll forever sing Your praise. I live to know You, Lord, I live to know You, Lord. </segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 1. Standing in Your presence, Lord, my heart and life are changed. Just to love You and to live to. See Your beauty and Your grace. </segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2. You've called me, I will follow. Your will for me, I'm sure.Let Your heart beat be my heart's cry, Let me live to serve Your call.    </segment3>
