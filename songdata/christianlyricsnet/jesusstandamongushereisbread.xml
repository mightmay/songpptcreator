		<segment1>JESUS, STAND AMONG US. At the meeting of our lives;. Be our sweet agreement. At the meeting of our eyes. O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here;. Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.</segment1>
		<segment2>So to You we're gathering. Out of each and every land;. Christ the love between us. At the joining of our hands. O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here;. Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.</segment2>
		<segment3>(Optional verse for Communion:). Jesus, stand among us. At the breaking of the bread;. Join us as one body. As we worship You, our Head. O Jesus, we love You, so we gather here;. Join our hearts in unity and take away our fear.</segment3>
