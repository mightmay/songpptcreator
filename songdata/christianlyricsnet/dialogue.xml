		<segment2>I'll Worship at Your Throne. Whisper my own love song. With all my heart I'll sing. For You my Dad and King. I'll live for all my days. To Put a smile on Your face. And when we finally meet. It'll be for eternity</segment2>
		<segment3>And Oh how wide You open up Your arms. When I need Your love. And how far You would come. If ever I was lost. And You said that all You feel for me. Is undying love. That You showed me through the cross</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll worship You my God. I'll worship You my God. I love You. I love You. Forever I will sing. Forever I will be with You. Be with You     </segment4>
