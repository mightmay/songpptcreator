		<segment1>crawling souls lost. inquisitive creep'n souls. but step check creep. but they mock me as they run around. i wont fall down to they ways of this world's lies. beneath your loving throne</segment1>
		<segment2>stop the voices in my head. cries of souls within dead lands. that try to stop this true love and joy. that spiritually surrounds me</segment2>
		<segment3>and as they mock yet they run. and as they run yet they mock. and as they mock yet they run. and i will never bow bow down</segment3>
		<segment4>hipocrites stab and mock back talk. deny true concepts of this walk. the bluff the bluff you can't even see inside. your so sick. deny refuse lies of retribution. no rewards within punishment. vision of his blood stains. and all i see is his face</segment4>
		<segment5>and as they mock yet they run. and as they run yet they mock. and as they mock yet they run. and i will never bow bow down</segment5>
		<segment6>but all i see crawlin' creepin' wayward souls. but this is what i see. that fits you so right. lies retribution on punishment in reward. but will never ever. never bow never bow down. you spiritually surround me    </segment6>
