		<segment1>Its the sun coming out when you didnt expect it. Finding your way when you needed direction. Everyday. We see it in so many ways. Its a cold glass of water when you feel thirsty. Things working out when youre in a hurry. It never ends. Like a faithful friend</segment1>
		<segment2>If you wanna know what Grace looks like. Let Love open up your eyes. Its not that far away. You might be amazed. Its all around, look and see. What God does for you and me. Seek and you will find. If you wanna know what Grace looks like</segment2>
		<segment3>Its a little bit of hope and sweet redemption. Maybe taking time to stop and listen. Just being there. Show someone that you care. Its living a life with your hands wide open. Giving all you got to a heart that is broken. For heavens sake. Whatever it takes.     </segment3>
