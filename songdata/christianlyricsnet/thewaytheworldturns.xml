		<segment1>Empty moments when I feel hopeless. Have left me restless inside. Doubt and sadness have kept me in fragments. Longing for a better life</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, its the way the world turns. The way, the way. And I feel the current pulling me down. Can keep the world from turning around. So I keep turning to You. I keep turning. Cuz Youre the hope of a new sunrise. Breaking over our desperate lives. And I keep on turning to You. I keep turning to You</segment2>
		<segment3>Im so distracted by senseless passions. Tempting my wandering eyes. But every person brings me closer to the truth. That only You can satisfy</segment3>
		<segment4>When I feel the current pulling me down. Can keep the world from turning around. Though I keep on turning to You. I keep turning. Cuz Youre the hope of a new sunrise. Breaking over our desperate lives. And I keep on turning to You. I keep turning</segment4>
		<segment5>From where were hurting. Keeps us turning to You. To You</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, its the way the world turns away. The world turns. Oh, and I keep on turning to You. Oh, its the way the world turns away. The world turns. Oh, and I keep on turning to You</segment6>
		<segment7>Cuz Youre the hope of a new sunrise. Breaking over our desperate lives. And I keep on turning to You. I keep turning to You    </segment7>
