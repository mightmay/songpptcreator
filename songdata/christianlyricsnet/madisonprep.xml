		<segment1>Give up what you think you have to say. Formalities weaken the meaning that you'd convey. In truth hidden in the veiled insults, have failed results for everyone that lived that way.</segment1>
		<segment2>The training spent on all your words. was obvious in all we heard. was repetition. Representing your best interests. while wishing us. &quot;the very best&quot;. when that is something. that you would never give.</segment2>
		<segment3>And some things are better stressed. when unexpressed, cause silence can be overwhelming</segment3>
		<segment4>We'll find some way to prove you wrong    </segment4>
