		<segment1>So here I go again, again. Ive let myself get spread so thin. I can see right through my skin. And I dont like what Im finding in my heart. So many different voices call. And I try hard to please them all. I run in circles til I fall. So Im falling on my knees and praying</segment1>
		<segment2>Please, please, please only You, only You. Please, please, please take my heart and make it true. Let everything I say and everything I do. Please, please only You. Please only You</segment2>
		<segment3>For every moment of my time. For every thought that fills my mind. For every melody and rhyme. This is the prayer that Ill be praying</segment3>
		<segment4>Please, please, please only You, only You. Please, please, please take my heart and make it true. In everything I say and everything I do</segment4>
		<segment5>This is what it means to be. The reason why I live and breathe. To know that I am totally existing for Your pleasure. Im still learning but I know. As this becomes my only goal. The more I find my heart and soul is filled up with joy when I. Please only you. Please only you</segment5>
		<segment6>Please, please, please only You, only You. Please, please, please take my heart and make it true. Let everything I say and everything I do. Please, please only You. I want to please only You. You, you, you, you, only you. Please, please, please take my heart and make it true. Let everything I say and everything I do. Please only You </segment6>
