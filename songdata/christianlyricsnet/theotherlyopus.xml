		<segment1>Clusters spring from the mounds. Assembled acorns form shapes of crowns. All the fair folks sing. Unto the wise who know to listen. Sleeping creatures revive. Woke by the faintest pinch of the pines. My own lyric ceases as a song arrives</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh oh, oh oh. Otherly Opus</segment2>
		<segment3>Autumn calls down the leaves. Tells the maple Drip from the trees. Sends out invitations. To unwrap the gift of seasons. What may come after these?. Age of sciences and of dreams. Medicines, inventions, and philosophies    </segment3>
