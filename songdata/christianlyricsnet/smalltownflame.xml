		<segment1>What a day it must have been. Finding out that you'd be rolling in. The driveway again. People calling up to say hello. Wondering why you never just said so. We thought we'd never know</segment1>
		<segment2>Well, maybe I could call you. I wonder how you'd be. Did you get the letters or ever think of me</segment2>
		<segment3>People always coming up and saying to me. She's thinking about bringing up a family. You know it's harder than it used to be. They say sometimes you bring up my name. You wanna catch a spark from a small town flame</segment3>
		<segment4>Well, maybe I could hide, but then I'd be cruel. Tell you that I love you but then I'd be a fool</segment4>
		<segment5>But maybe all I am is a lonely fool. Foolishly in love with a woman who. I never really knew. When I needed you, you were gone with the wind. I never really knew how the story began. Or if it would ever end. But the wind blows strong tonight. And you small town flame. He's out like a light</segment5>
		<segment6>Maybe I could hide but then I'd be cruel. Tell you that I love you, but then I'd be a fool</segment6>
		<segment7>But maybe all I am just a fool. Foolishly in love with a woman who. I never really knew. When I needed you, you were gone with the wind. I never really knew how the story began. Or if it would ever end. But the wind blows strong tonight. And you small town flame. He's out like a light    </segment7>
