		<segment1>I open my eyes just to close 'em again. From the horrors that I see before me. On the edge of depth I stand and stare down below. At something never ment for a man to behold</segment1>
		<segment2>I stand upon the mountainside of my mind. And stare the walls inside - I'm Icebound</segment2>
		<segment3>Harsh cold walls of ice in my mind. Lock me deep inside - I'm Icebound</segment3>
		<segment4>Falling from the edge of depth. Deep in to a tragedy. Thrown into obscurity</segment4>
		<segment5>I opened my eyes again to look into the eyes of end. But there was nothing for my eyes to see. Deep inside I had a new belief and took another view into. My soul that used to be icebound</segment5>
		<segment6>Falling from the edge of depth. Deep into a tragedy. Thrown in front of divinity. Thought I even heard the angels sing. With eyes open wide I now stare into depth. As all my demons are gone for a while. And I still can hear the echoes of the angels singing. What I thought a tragedy became essence of my life</segment6>
		<segment7>I stand upon the mountainside of my mind. And witness the meltdown - of Icebound</segment7>
		<segment8>Cold walls of ice fall down in my mind. Freeing me from inside - of Icebound</segment8>
		<segment9>Standing on the edge of depth. Staring into divinity. I threw away my vanity.     </segment9>
