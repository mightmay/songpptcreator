		<segment1>Just a small town girl. Livin' in a lonely world. She took the midnight train goin' anywhere</segment1>
		<segment2>Just a city boy. Born and raised in south Detroit. He took the midnight train goin' anywhere</segment2>
		<segment3>A singer in a smoky room. A smell of wine and cheap perfume. For a smile they can share the night. It goes on and on and on and on</segment3>
		<segment4>Strangers waiting. Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlight people. Living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night</segment4>
		<segment5>Working hard to get my fill. Everybody wants a thrill. Payin' anything to roll the dice. just one more time</segment5>
		<segment6>Some will win, some will lose. Some were born to sing the blues. Oh, the movie never ends. It goes on and on and on and on</segment6>
		<segment7>Strangers waiting. Up and down the boulevard. Their shadows searching in the night. Streetlight people. Living just to find emotion. Hiding somewhere in the night</segment7>
		<segment8>Don't stop believin'. Hold on to that feelin'. Streetlight people</segment8>
		<segment9>Don't stop believin'. Hold on. Streetlight people</segment9>
		<segment10>Don't stop believin'. Hold on to that feelin'. Streetlight people    </segment10>
