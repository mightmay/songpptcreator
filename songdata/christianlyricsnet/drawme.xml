		<segment1>Draw me, oh, draw me, please draw me, my jesus. Into your presence, where I cannot lie. My soul is so thirsty, I cannot endure it. And if I can't get closer, I surely will die.</segment1>
		<segment2>Take me, oh take me, please take me, my jesus. Quickly, before I forget that I'm lost. For so many times, my mind has deceived me, That I really don't have to carry the cross. That I really don't have to carry the cross.</segment2>
		<segment3>I just need to know how to pray. My wicked desires block the way, Sometimes I have grieved you away, I don't want to do that today.</segment3>
		<segment4>Help me, oh help me, please help me my jesus. Save me from sins that I thought were all gone. Kill me with kindness, and break through my blindness. I know till I'm dead, I can never live on. I know till I'm dead, I can never live on.</segment4>
		<segment5>I just need to know how to pray. My wicked desires block the way, Sometimes I have grieved you away, I don't want to do that today.</segment5>
		<segment6>Draw me, oh draw me, please draw me my jesus.    </segment6>
