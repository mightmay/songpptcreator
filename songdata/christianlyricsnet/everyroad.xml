		<segment1>There you go makin' mountains out of such a little hill. Here I go mixin' mortar for another wall to build. There's a struggle in this life we lead it's partly you it's partly me</segment1>
		<segment2>But every road that's traveled teaches something new. And every road that's narrow pushes us to choose. And I'd be lyin' if I said, &quot;I had not tried to leave a time or two&quot;. But every road that leads me, leads me back to you</segment2>
		<segment3>Here we stand in the middle of what we've come to know. It's a dance, it's a balance, holding on and letting go. But there is nothing that we can't resolve. When love's at stake, when love's involved</segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause every road that's traveled teaches something new. And every road that's narrow pushes us to choose. And I'd be lyin' if I said, &quot;I had not tried to leave a time or two&quot;. But every road that leads me, leads me back to you</segment4>
		<segment5>Every road that's traveled teaches something new. And every road that's narrow pushes us to choose. And I'd be lyin' if I said, &quot;I had not tried to leave a time or two&quot;. (Time or two). And every road that leads me, leads me back to you</segment5>
		<segment6>Every road that leads me, leads me back to you. Every road leads more, leading me back to you. Leading me back to you    </segment6>
