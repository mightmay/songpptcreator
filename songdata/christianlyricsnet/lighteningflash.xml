		<segment1>I sat and watched the waves. Beat yesterdays into the ground. Like through an hourglass. The hours passed without sound. Circling above me the sound of wings. The earth shakes my feet. And she starts to sing</segment1>
		<segment2>Then I saw the lightning flash. Heard the thunder in the sky. Then I saw the lightning flash. Heard the thunder in the sky </segment2>
		<segment3>Now time stands still in space. The cloud-like lace surrounds Him. The perfect love affair. His bride to carry is home. Longing to tell her the love He bore. Was worth His whole life. And there's nothing worth more</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
