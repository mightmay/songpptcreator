		<segment1>Woke up this morning, went to the window, saw a rainy day. Feeling the pressure from all the things I gotta face today. All of my days, are totally crazy can't do nothing right. It's an ordinary day. </segment1>
		<segment2>Every minute feels like an hour slowly creeping by. All of this stress but I do my best to keep it all in stride. I need to decide. I need to unwind. All these things are on my mind. It's an ordinary day. </segment2>
		<segment3>[chorus]. Things are crazy but it's all right. You make me feel alright again. When it rains you are the sunshine. That lights me up from deep with in. I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure. You given me the pleasure of an ordinary day </segment3>
		<segment4>Pounding the pavement. Another engagement. Gotta make it there on time. Hitting the side walk. Hearing the small talk of people passing by. Wondering why. Gotta rewind. Think I gotta clear my mind. It's an ordinary day. </segment4>
		<segment5>What are the chances I've locked glances with a passer by. Oh, a stranger must be an angel cause he smiled. I wonder if he knows anything I know that there is life. In an ordinary day. </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus]    </segment6>
