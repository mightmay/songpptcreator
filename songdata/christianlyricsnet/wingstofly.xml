		<segment1>As I open my eyes Lord, It's a brand new day. Your glory shines like the sun on a hot summer's day. I lift my hands to you Lord. Forgive me, oh Lord forgive me. I am so weak, But you are strong. You are the Son high in the sky. Draw me near and give me wings to fly. I wanna be where you are, Lord where you are. Now the time has come to pick up my cross. And run to the everlasting grace you give. You hold a promise. Come and take my hand. And guide me to your loving hand, Lord. You are the Son high in the sky. Draw me near and give me wings to fly. I wanna be where you are.    </segment1>
