		<segment1>A barren land and a barren wife. Made Abraham laugh at his wandering life. A cruel joke it seemed then to call him the father of nations. A heavenly prank, a celestial joke. Cause grey hair and babies leave no room for hope. But hoping is something this hopeless old man learned to do</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: They called him laughter. For he came after. The father had made an impossible promise come true. The birth of a baby to a hopeless old lady. So they called him laughter. Cause no other name would do</segment2>
		<segment3>A cry in the darkness and laughter at night. An elderly couple sat holding him tight. An imporbable infant, a punchline, a promise come true. They laughed til they wept then laughted at their tears. This miracle baby they've wanted for years. Would make a messiah who'd give us impossible joy</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus(X2)    </segment4>
