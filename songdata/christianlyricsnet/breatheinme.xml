		<segment1>Verse 1: Mercy, in your tender mercy. Look on me (x2). Frailty, even in my frailty. Welcome me (x2)</segment1>
		<segment2>Bridge: Father this my own vocation that you would come and lead me once again</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Breath in me breathe of God. Mend in me this wounded heart. That I may know youve made your peace with me. Breathe in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: Burden take away this burden. Set me free (x2). Calling, I have heard you calling. Out for me you shout for me</segment4>
