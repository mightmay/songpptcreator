		<segment1>The worst time, to hit you with my first line, no. Everything seemed fine, when I hold you like you're one-of-a-kind. You said you were a sure sign, it's feeling like the last time. Play it back, it's going over and over. Give it up and pull me through, all of this to tell you..</segment1>
		<segment2>I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far. Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are. This could be my last goodbye. You could stay, I'll be alright. I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far</segment2>
		<segment3>If I might say, all of this seems to float away from.. Your lips when they're kissing me, and your hips when leaving me for. The last time, I'm thinking of the first time, ohh. The first time, I'm thinking of the last time. Play it back, it's going over and over</segment3>
		<segment4>You're trying me so I'm moving on, all of this to tell you..</segment4>
		<segment5>I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far. Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are. This could be my last goodbye. You could stay, I'll be alright. I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far</segment5>
		<segment6>This is where we left off and I'm trying hard to let go. This is where we left off and I'm still waiting to see if you'll show</segment6>
		<segment7>The first time, I'm thinking of the last time. The last time, I'm thinking of the first time</segment7>
		<segment8>I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far. Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are. This could be my last goodbye, You could stay, I'll be alright. I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far    </segment8>
