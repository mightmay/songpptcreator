		<segment1>they shine like dawn on an open Psalm. a knowing smile from something You said. I hunger for the daily bread of Your ways. ah, the bread of Your ways. they glow like blue in a field of black. illuminating the runway ahead. I love to follow the angel tread of Your ways. ah, the tread of Your ways </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I love Your ways (Your true, Your perfect ways). I love Your ways (so beautiful to me). lovely always (and faithful to restore). I love Your ways </segment2>
		<segment3>and when I tire, they bring a second wind. a word in season, a gleam in Your eye. I love to feel the runner's high of Your ways. ah, the high of Your ways. I lived so long under basement floors. the flickering lights, the windowless gloom. I'm here to stay in the upper room of Your ways. ah, the room of Your ways </segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus - </segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: I need Your good word speaking. when there's nothing to say. I need Your Spirit here. breathing on me every day. every night I need Your love's pure light. and I've learned forever to trust. ever to follow. ever I'll praise Your everlasting ways. (Your everlasting ways. Your everlasting ways) </segment5>
		<segment6>- Chorus -. I love Your ways    </segment6>
