		<segment1>Even though, I wasn't bold. I didn't doubt the Lord. I didn't know what to think when He came. And said, Speak to them all my words. But my Lord, I speak so horribly. And I feel like I'm far too young. Somebody else should take my place. You know that God told me to move along. Whoa! Be bold, Jeremiah. Don't let them see you are afraid. Whoa! Be bold, Jeremiah. Let them hear what Ive got to say. Prophesied to all my friends and foes. Prophesied to people I'd just met. They all threw me out and said go away. It might be 'cause I prophesied their destruction. But my Lord keeps callin' me back there. As I get on with servin' my sentence. Prophesyin' -- got tears in my eyes. You know that God said, Go and tell them all to. Get repentant. CHORUS. Dungeon bound they threw me in the ground. Until the king pulled me out. Ive got to keep on preachin' on. They all said, Big deal, he's a prisoner now!. And I'm hopin' for some visitation. You know but I can surely see. That I don't want to get cut off whenever. Punishment's comin' down on this city. CHORUS 3X. Be bold, Jeremiah -- Carry the news I spoke. Be bold, Jeremiah -- And prepare them for Babylon    </segment1>
