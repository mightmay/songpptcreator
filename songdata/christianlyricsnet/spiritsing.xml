		<segment1>All grown up with nowhere to go. How come nothing feels quite like home?. Sometimes it hurts to be awake. What's the plan when we've got no plan?. A costly piece of paper in hand. But that's not what it takes</segment1>
		<segment2>Spirit, sing out a little louder. My flesh is so weak. But it screams with all its strength. Spirit grow up, into a flower. My flesh is like a weed. That strangles out the seed. And blocks out the sunlight</segment2>
		<segment3>You could say we're living on prayer. Boomerangs that fly in the air. We're back where we started from</segment3>
		<segment4>Spirit, sing out a little louder. My flesh is so weak. But it screams with all its strength. Spirit grow up, into a flower. My flesh is like a weed. That strangles out the seed. And blocks out the sunlight</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't we need something, need something to live for? It's You. Don't we all need something, need something we'd die for? It's You. That's all I know to do, so please</segment5>
		<segment6>Spirit, sing out a little louder. My flesh is so weak. But it screams with all its strength. Spirit grow up, into a flower. My flesh is like a weed. That strangles out the seed. And blocks out the sunlight    </segment6>
