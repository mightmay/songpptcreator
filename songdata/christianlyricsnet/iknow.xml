		<segment1>Though I'm walling through the valley. Of the darkest hour I've known. Lord don't You leave me all alone. When I'm surrounded by the shadows. That seem to feed my fear. I will trust You. Though I may not feel You here</segment1>
		<segment2>But I know that Your love is unfailing. O I know Your grace is so amazing. O I know even though my faith be shaken. O I still know Ill never be forsaken. Cause Youre always faithful. I know</segment2>
		<segment3>When my bed has been floating. On the flood of all my tears. Seems as though my joy has disappeared. Still I will not put my hope. In what I feel or see. I will cling to You. And Trust Youre holding me</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause I know that Your love is unfailing. O I know Your grace is so amazing. O I know even though my faith be shaken. O I still know Ill never be forsaken. Cause Youre always faithful. I know</segment4>
		<segment5>. I worship You. I look to You. I trust You with m life. I worship You. I look to You. Come lift my head up high</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord I dont know where Im walking. But Ill take it day by day. And Ill hold Your hand. And You will lead the way</segment6>
		<segment7>And I know that Your love is unfailing. O I know Your grace is so amazing. O I know even though my faith be shaken. O I still know Ill never be forsaken. Cause Youre always faithful. I know    </segment7>
