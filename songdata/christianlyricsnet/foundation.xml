		<segment1>Inside my mind where thoughts reside. my point of view, my life, nothing can change. my fight for what I know is right. I will fall to my knees a humble servant, my spirit is willing but my flesh is weak. Weak against the pressures of this world. which drag me down and shove my face in my mistakes. To let me know that I can break, break but never break apart. For no one could ever. change my heart. Trials, tests of faith to challenge your beliefs. to test if your stand is weak, never shame to stand up for your cause. a foundation strong, suffer not a loss.    </segment1>
