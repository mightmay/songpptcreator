		<segment1>I have a dream that I will be someone. You can call on when the darkness falls. That I will be strong for You. I have a dream that You will see me. Shining brightly like a thousand stars. But I will go far for You</segment1>
		<segment2>I may seem small, with no hope at all. But this heart of mine still dares to dream. May love come by this hold on life. But I'm still hopeful for so many things</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause I'm standing tall and I am. On Your shoulders. The stars don't seem so far at all. With You, it seems I could be. Someone who one day might be there for You too</segment3>
		<segment4>I have a dream that I'll be a teacher. Maybe a husband, and a father too. I dream for two. And one day maybe I will be famous. You'll see my name where the heroes lie. I can only try for You</segment4>
		<segment5>I may seem small, with no hope at all. But this heart of mine still dares to dream. May love come by this hold on life. But I'm still hopeful for so many things</segment5>
		<segment6>'Cause I'm standing tall and I am. On Your shoulders. The stars don't seem so far at all. With You, it seems I could be. Someone who one day might be there for You too. I am a dreamer</segment6>
		<segment7>Help me be there for You, Lord. Let me be there for You. I wanna be there for You. I wanna be there for You</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm standing tall and I am. On Your shoulders. The stars don't seem so far at all. With You, it seems I could be. Someone who one day might be there for You too    </segment8>
