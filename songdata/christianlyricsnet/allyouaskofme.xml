		<segment1>Somehow I always seem to do. The very thing I hate. And I can't find the strength to change. Feels like I'm getting in your way. And now I'm living with the pain. Of knowing that I let you down</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord you've seen my darkest hour. Still you know my hearts desire. And I .</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't want to fall short of. All you've made me to be. And I.. I don't have to cause I know you. Made a way for me to be. All you ask of me</segment3>
		<segment4>You don't see me as I am. I know you have a plan. To complete your work in me. You've gone and named me as your own. It's like a hope I've never known. Because you're mercy covers me</segment4>
		<segment5>Lord you've seen my darkest hour. Still you know my hearts desire</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. There on Calvary you took the nail and thought of me. You bore the shame of fallen man. There on Calvary you paid my debt and set me free. And now I'm free to live again.     </segment6>
