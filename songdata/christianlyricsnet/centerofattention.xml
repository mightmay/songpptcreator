		<segment1>Why do some of you think you're better than everyone who is around you?. We all live, love, bleed, die. Why do some of you think you're better than everyone who is around you?. Your pride will bring you down</segment1>
		<segment2>Your pride will bring you down, keep your head up in the clouds. I'll knock your fight back to the ground. Your pride will bring you down</segment2>
		<segment3>And now you'll learn, that you're no better than me. And I'm not better than you. You'll learn this all right now</segment3>
		<segment4>Christian or not, you're forgiven    </segment4>
