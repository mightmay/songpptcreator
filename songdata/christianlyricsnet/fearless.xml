		<segment1>When you see your breath in the frozen night. When your hope is on the guard. There's a rushing breath, there's a new design. When the poison fills your heart</segment1>
		<segment2>Broken from the shattered hopes and breathless from the stare. Standing in this phony room I can see you there</segment2>
		<segment3>Lights from the waters have swept me away. So say your goodbyes now, this will say. Drink from the water that swept me away. So say your goodbyes now, this will say</segment3>
		<segment4>Let the tide pull and the neon lights. Let them spill across this place. Like a deepened hole from your glossy eyes. There's a flame that marks the race</segment4>
		<segment5>Broken from the shattered hopes and breathless from the stare. Standing in this phony room I can see you there</segment5>
		<segment6>Lights from the waters have swept me away. So say your goodbyes now, this will say. Drink from the water that swept me away. So say your goodbyes now, this will say</segment6>
		<segment7>Can you hear, whispering aside. Dream the fear, are you listening?</segment7>
		<segment8>Lights from the waters have swept me away. So say your goodbyes now, this will say. Drink from the water that swept me away. So say your goodbyes now, this will say</segment8>
		<segment9>Drink from the water that swept me away. So say your goodbyes now, this will say</segment9>
		<segment10>*&lt;em&gt;These lyrics may be incorrect and will be updated when the album is released&lt;/em&gt;*    </segment10>
