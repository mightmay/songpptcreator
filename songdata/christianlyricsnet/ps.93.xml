		<segment1>
The LORD reigns, he is clothed with majesty; . The Lord has gold and girding himself with strength.. Indeed, the world is firmly established, . It will not be moved, . It will not be moved. </segment1>
		<segment2>And Thy throne is established from of old. . Thou art from everlasting. . And Thy throne is established from of old.</segment2>
		<segment3>The floods have lifted up, O LORD, . The floods have lifted up their voice, . The floods lift up their pounding waves,. More than the sound of many waters.</segment3>
		<segment4>They're the mighty breakers of the sea. The LORD on high is mighty. Their testimonies this wholly confirm.  . Holiness befits your house, O LORD, for evermore.. Holiness befits your house, O LORD, for evermore.
