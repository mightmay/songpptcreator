		<segment1>&quot;it has done me good to be somewhat parched by the heat. and drenched by the rain of life.&quot;. -henry w. longfellow</segment1>
		<segment2>when you opened up your mouth. did it appear to be. a final falling out. with what is left of me. hear the laughter on the hill. when everything is still</segment2>
		<segment3>naturally it makes me angry. i'm overwhelmed with hate and worry. i've been lying on the floor for hours. with principalities and powers</segment3>
		<segment4>could it have ever been. but near the end. you open up your mouth. it all comes falling out. hear the crying on the hill. when everything is still</segment4>
		<segment5>naturally it makes me angry. i'm overwhelmed with hate and worry. i've been lying on the floor for hours. with principalities and powers</segment5>
		<segment6>don't you ever say to me again. it's all over now. and don't it feel. that's all too real. you saved my soul. but did you open up your head. and did you figure out again. that the redemption never ends. in spite of me</segment6>
		<segment7>come on over. it's all over. i'm on your good side</segment7>
		<segment8>i've been holding in to feel the same. if i could get into the game. it's all my fault. you said to me yourself to let it go. now i can feel it so much more. than i've known. well i heard about our friend. i hear he'll never hope again. it's all the same.     </segment8>
