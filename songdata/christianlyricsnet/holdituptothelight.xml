		<segment1>It's the choice of a lifetime &amp; I'm almost sure. I will not live my life in between anymore. If I can't be certain of all that's in store. This far it feels so right. I will hold it up hold it up to the light, Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light</segment1>
		<segment2>The search for my future has brought me here. This is more than I'd hoped for, but sometimes I fear. That the choice I was made for will someday appear. And I'll be too late for that flight. So hold it up hold it up to the light, Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light</segment2>
		<segment3>I said God, will you bless this decision?. I'm scared. Is my life at stake?. But I know if you gave me a vision. Would I never have reason to use my faith?</segment3>
		<segment4>Now as soon as I'm moving my choice is good. This way comes through right where I prayed that it would. If I keep my eyes open and look where I should. Somehow all of the signs are in sight. If I hold up the light</segment4>
		<segment5>It's too late to be stopped at the crossroads. Each life here and each a possible way. But wait and they all will be lost roads. Each path's growing shorter the longer I stay</segment5>
		<segment6>I was dead with deciding and afraid to choose. I was mourning the loss of the choices I'd lose. But there's no choice at all if I don't make my move. And trust that the timing is right. I will hold it up hold it up to the light. Hold it up to the light, hold it up to the light.    </segment6>
