		<segment1>(Verse 1). Send me a sign. A hint, O whisper. Fill me with life. 'Cause I am listening</segment1>
		<segment2>Come break the quiet. Breathe your awakening. Bring me the light. 'Cause I am fading</segment2>
		<segment3>Surround me with the rush of angels' wings</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus 1). Shine Your light so I can see You. Pull me up, I need to be near You. Hold me, I need to feel loved. Can You overcome this heart that's overcome?</segment4>
		<segment5>(Verse 2). You sent a sign. The hint, O whisper. Human, divine. Everyone is listening</segment5>
		<segment6>Death laid low. Quiet in the night is stirring</segment6>
		<segment7>All around the rush of angels</segment7>
		<segment8>(Bridge). O the wonder of the greatest love has come</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus 2). Shine Your light so all can see it. Lifted up, 'cause the whole world needs it. Love has come, what joy to hear it. He has overcome, He has overcome</segment9>
