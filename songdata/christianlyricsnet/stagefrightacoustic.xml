		<segment1>Every time when I close my eye. I catch a glimpse of the west coast sun-rise. And I can tell you, you're just as beautiful</segment1>
		<segment2>Overwhelmed by the fear and stage-fright. You're the only one in my spot-light. Even when you don't so beautiful</segment2>
		<segment3>We've got one chance, We've got one chance. We've got on chance to shine, to shine</segment3>
		<segment4>Still awake at the start of daylight. I miss you bad, but I swear I'm alright. I'll see you soon, when the leave turn colorful</segment4>
		<segment5>I see your face in my own reflection. Scan the crowd but there's no connection. With out you, nothing feels like home</segment5>
		<segment6>We've got one chance, We've got one chance. We've got on chance to shine</segment6>
		<segment7>We've got one chance to make things right. We've got on chance to shine, to shine, to shine, to shine</segment7>
		<segment8>We've got one chance to make things right. We've got on chance to shine</segment8>
		<segment9>We've got one chance, We've got one chance. We've got on chance to shine    </segment9>
