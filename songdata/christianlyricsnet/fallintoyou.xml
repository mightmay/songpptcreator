		<segment1>Time stand still. In this moment. Dawn arise. From nights keeping </segment1>
		<segment2>All my love. Stored up treasure. Heart awake from your sleeping</segment2>
		<segment3>And all I really want to say is I love you. And all I really want to do is be next to you </segment3>
		<segment4>Here on the edge. Of what lies ahead. Ready to fall into you. Fall into you</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm not afraid. Of change or of pain. Ready to fall into you. Fall into you</segment5>
		<segment6>Searching heart. Search is over. Peace has proven you real. Guarded heart, Guard this love now. As faithfulness is revealed</segment6>
		<segment7>And all I really want to say is I love you. And all I really want to do is be next to you</segment7>
		<segment8>Here on the edge. Of what lies ahead. Ready to fall into you. Fall into you</segment8>
		<segment9>I'm not afraid. Of change or of pain. Ready to fall into you. Fall into you.     </segment9>
