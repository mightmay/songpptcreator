		<segment1>I'm running a race that I'm not gonna lose. 'Cause everything changed when I met You. So I'm laying all my tomorrows in Your hands. I'm standing on every word You've said. I'm holding onto Your promises. And I know my hope and my future are found in You</segment1>
		<segment2>With everything that You've started in me. I believe that You will be faithful</segment2>
		<segment3>And I receive. Everything that You're doing in me. And I believe. That the rest of my life. Will be the best days of my life</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm waking to find Your mercies new. I'm walking upon Your grace and truth. And I know Your Spirit will lead me. On my way. I'm giving away this life I have. I'll give it my all Lord I won't hold back. 'Til I stand before You in heaven. Finally home</segment4>
		<segment5>You pulled me out from where I was. And You set my feet on a solid rock. You've given me a brand new song to sing. So I won't fear You'll see me through. The darkness is as light to You. And I know You're gonna make the night shine like the day. And I believe it (that)</segment5>
		<segment6>I know You're coming back for me. And the rest of my life. Will be the best of my life</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh I receive. Everything that You're doing in me. And I believe. That the rest of my life. Will be the best of my life. I know You're coming back for me. Yes I know You're coming back for me. I'm living for eternity. And I know that the rest of my life. Will be the best days of my life    </segment7>
