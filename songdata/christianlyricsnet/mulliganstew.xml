		<segment1>Friday night is coming so you're saving all your money. Cause you need to buy some buds and some beer. You won't be doin nothing cause you spent up all your money. So you smoke until you choke and drink your beer all alone</segment1>
		<segment2>You drank up all your beer and you're feeling fine. You look up at the clock, it's only quarter till nine. So you woof a bunch of munchies cause there's nothing to do. But when you find they don't mix, you're chunkin' mulligans stew</segment2>
		<segment3>Now you're moving up. Smoking major league base balls. Your price is getting higher each hit. The night keeps getting longer, a couple hits will make you stronger. So ya smoke another 8-ball and get deeper in debt</segment3>
		<segment4>You've got this young blonde. Who's as thin as a dime. She's inhaling all your blow and leaving nothing behind. As your debt keeps coming with the rising sun. When you look for what you want you know that she'll be gone. (You got it)</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus Christ is coming. So we've got to get ready. For broad is the road to death. Jesus hasn't come to call the righteous (but the sinners). For all have fallen short of the glory of God    </segment5>
