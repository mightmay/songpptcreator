		<segment1>i have been swept away. you have been pushed aside. iive been so consumed with me. you havent crossed my mind. but even if i ran away. and even if i cross the street. one thing will remain. you will always follow me</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus:). and i will.i will not be caught without you. seasons will come and go. and life will not be the same. and yet may that be true for me. that i will grow along the way. (chorus)    </segment2>
