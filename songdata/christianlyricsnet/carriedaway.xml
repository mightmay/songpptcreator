		<segment1>You're standing right behind me. I feel you breathing down my neck. I try to catch you, but you're gone. You whisper words that draw me. Into your web of influence. Your sweet illusion's like a song. You say my name. Like I'm the only game in this town. But just the same. You know you gotta stop hangin' around </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I'm carried away. A full-on freak display. I've got so much to say. No you're never gonna get my crown. No you're never gonna shut me down </segment2>
		<segment3>You're such the fallen angel. You're such the villain in disguise. Tellin' dark and lovely lies. I dove right into your ocean. Tasted the salt of murky seas. I've seen beyond your mysteries. And I'm to blame. Thought I was the only game in this town. But you're so vain. That you're never gonna figure it out </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause I'm carried away. So carried away. I'm carried away, so carried away </segment5>
		<segment6>Sticks and stones from you lofty throne. My soul's been set free    </segment6>
