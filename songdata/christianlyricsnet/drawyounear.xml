		<segment1>When the world loses it's luster. And you're feeling sad and lonely. And you need someone to be there in your time of need. You can turn your eyes to the heavens. And their Creator's watching on you. With arms of love to hold you, and draw you near</segment1>
		<segment2>I woke up on this morning and misery surrounds me. And I am forced to face a day I didn't even want to begin. God knows I'm going through it. It's hard to imagine I can make it this time. As my sadness mounts I pray that this day would end. Cry myself to sleep and then start again</segment2>
		<segment3>You're in the midst of heartache. Perhaps you've lost a loved one. Lost all your faith can barely pray. Well darling, don't give up now. I know that inevitably this too shall pass. Trouble doesn't last always, hold on through the pain. I believe the sun will outlast your rain</segment3>
		<segment4>Just to take the pain away, so you can see a brighter day. I know you can find the strength that you need. To get you through what you're going through. So when the world seems to crash down on you</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't worry, no matter, He hears you, keep praying. Don't worry, no matter, He hears you, keep praying    </segment5>
