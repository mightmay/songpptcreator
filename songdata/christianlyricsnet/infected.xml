		<segment1>I still wonder when the medicine will take it's effect. And The injection they made, it's all just left me the same. I'ts hard to concentrate with echo's of your voice in my head. From all you said, im still paralized. But i'm almost out of breathe from saying things that i'll regret. My time is over, i cant do this alone. I'm infected with you, pull the plug already. Tell me before i go, that your infected with me. I cant remember if i ever took a minute to say. That if it had to be now, i'm glad it had to be me. I cant recuperate, i'm never going to leave here alive. Just help me throu this, dont let me die here. But i'm almost out of breath from saying things i'll regret. My time is over, i cant do this alone, i'm infected with you, pull the plug already. Tell me before i go, that your infected with me. I'm killing time just trying to find the words that fall so short of you. I'm loosing sleep, i cant compete, i'm giving out, i cant do this alone.    </segment1>
