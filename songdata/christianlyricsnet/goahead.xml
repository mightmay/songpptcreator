		<segment1>Yesterday. I heard Your voice. Whispering through. All the noise. I pretended. I couldn't hear You. But You kept. On pursuing me. And You began. To move in me. And I just. Couldn't hide any more. I won't fight You</segment1>
		<segment2>Go ahead. Take what You want to. Take what You need to. Don't let me hold You back. Go ahead. Do what You have to. Cuz I want to know You. Don't let me hold You back</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll my wear heart. Out on my sleeve. If it brings You close to me. Help me leave the life. I knew before You. Come inside, erase the shame. Call me by different name. I won't be the same anymore. God, I trust You</segment3>
		<segment4>God, I was so wrong. To stay away so long. Oh, how I need You    </segment4>
