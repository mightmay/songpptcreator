		<segment1>My pain and problems keep me chained. And my troubled heart makes me weak. I'll wait for You to comfort me. And in You, I know I'll find my strength</segment1>
		<segment2>I will soar on the wings of eagles. I will learn to fly high above this world. And I will soar on the wings of eagles. I will learn to fly. I will learn to fly high above this world</segment2>
		<segment3>I tremble with this heavy weight. And I'm buried underneath my grief. I'll run to You and not grow faint. And I'll lay my burdens at Your feet</segment3>
		<segment4>.     </segment4>
