		<segment1>Wherever you are tonight girl. I'll see you in my dreams. Wherever I go tomorrow. You'll be here next to me</segment1>
		<segment2>And though we are a world apart. I know you'll never be that far</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: 'Cause here in my heart. There's a picture of us. Together forever. Unfaded and unbroken. Wherever you are. Your love covers me. Forever more you'll be. Here in my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>Whenever I miss you so much. It's more than I can bear. I won't cry, I'll just close my eyes. And know you'll be there</segment4>
		<segment5>Your kiss and your touch. I'll never forget. 'Cause you're as close. As my very next breath</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>And though we are a world apart. I know you'll never be that far</segment7>
