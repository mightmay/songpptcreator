		<segment1>And it hurt just to touch. On the words I said too much. I was just a kid. I thought that I could not be caught and much less by a moment. But the words came flooding from my mouth</segment1>
		<segment2>Some things will never surface. They capsized so long ago. I didnt want to still be sinking. But the anchor, wont let me go</segment2>
		<segment3>Those things that we thought, were never there. Those ghosts we brought with us everywhere</segment3>
		<segment4>From your birth you were born in to this. Never knowing when the walls would crack. In your defense you were so unprepared you. Said the things that you cant take back</segment4>
		<segment5>Those things that we thought were never there. Those ghosts we brought with us everywhere</segment5>
		<segment6>I want to explain this. But nothings making sense. Theres poison in my blood. (Theres poison in my blood)</segment6>
		<segment7>It claimed both of our lives. That world we thought important. Crumbled into nothing</segment7>
		<segment8>Will words define me? I am more than a moment. Will words define me? I am more than a moment. That day behind me, but I cannot shake it. I am more than a moment, more than a moment</segment8>
		<segment9>And the beauty left my eyes. I was standing there with the rest of my life. Knowing I would never be the same. Knowing I had changed. I had become more than what I had dreamed. The look of the youth but with hands stained. The look of the youth but with my hands stained</segment9>
		<segment10>Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I'm sorry. Does she know I'm sorry?. Guilty, guilty, I am guilty</segment10>
		<segment11>How were those words in my head? (I am so sorry for what I have done). For somebody else, somebody else. I wish that I could have said (they all asked me why and I know). Anything else, anything else (I know I still cant stop myself)</segment11>
		<segment12>I want to explain this. But nothings making sense. Theres poison in my blood. (Theres poison in my blood)</segment12>
		<segment13>It claimed both of our lives. That world we thought important. Crumbled into nothing</segment13>
		<segment14>But the bitter treasures so elementary    </segment14>
