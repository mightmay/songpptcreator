		<segment1>The choices, even though you knew the lines. You'd have to cross for me. You made them anyway. Voices, as you knelt there in the garden. 'Neath the olive tree. You heard me call your name. I cannot pretend to understand it all. But heaven knew the reason you were there </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. It was all about a man. It was all about a cross. It was all about the blood that was shed. So I would not be lost. It was all about the love. That was bigger than a life. It was all about a freedom that was given. Through your sacrifice. 'Cause you would rather die. Than to ever live without me </segment2>
		<segment3>Helpless, that's humanity without your saving grace. So misled. Selfless, you could have called ten thousand angels. Down to take your place. But you took mine instead. I cannot pretend to understand it all. But heaven knew the reason you were there</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>A greater love has no one than this. That he will lay his life down for his friends</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus </segment6>
		<segment7>.     </segment7>
