		<segment1>Never reaching what I want to reach. Never being who I want to be. Blaming me when I fall and fail. All my dreams splintering. Under my fingernails. Under my fingernails </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm empty, lonely, and accused. Accused without a word. My fingernails are chipping down. From clawing in the dirt. I'm so lost, lost and confused. I threw it all away. How can I be beautiful. When I am so afraid </segment2>
		<segment3>Never reaching what I want to reach. Never being who I want to be. Blaming me when I fall and fail. All my dreams splintering. Under my fingernails. All my dreams out of reach. Under my fingernails </segment3>
		<segment4>I watched it all slip through my hands. My brokenness revealed. I'm so proud, I'm so proud. I'm crying to be filled. I'm killing, destroying the plague. That's killing me away. I've got to live, I've got to love. Like I am unafraid </segment4>
		<segment5>Never reaching what I want to reach. Never being who I want to be. Blaming me when I fall and fail. All my dreams splintering. Under my fingernails (2x) </segment5>
		<segment6>All my dreams out of reach. Under my fingernails </segment6>
		<segment7>I'm wasting, wasting every moment. I want to be tasting. Tasting every moment with you. I'm suffering, I'm bleeding, on my knees. Who's going to save me?. Suffering, bleeding. Save me from this pit of frailty </segment7>
		<segment8>Never reaching what I want to reach. Never being who I want to be. Blaming me when I fall and fail. All my dreams splintering. Under my fingernails (2x) </segment8>
		<segment9>All my dreams out of reach. Under my fingernails </segment9>
		<segment10>Never reaching me </segment10>
		<segment11>    </segment11>
