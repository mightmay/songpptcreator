		<segment1>I was born with no chance at life. Dead before I took my first breath. I was born with no family ties. Alone before I knew where I lived</segment1>
		<segment2>They called me broken, worthless, and a shame. They called me wasted, used up, and chained. But you made me Your child. And You called me Your own. Now they can call me, But they've got to use my new name</segment2>
		<segment3>I walked miles and couldn't find a home. There was no place that I belonged. I walked for days and days and weeks and years. Couldn't find a melody for my song</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't need money, I don't need fame. I don't need the love that this world can bring. I don't need this prison, I don't need these chains. I needed a Father, and Child is my new name    </segment4>
