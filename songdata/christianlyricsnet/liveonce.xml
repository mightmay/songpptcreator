		<segment1>I don't speak often cause I don't speak well. so every song I write has a story to tell. of all I've learned living with myself. so these are my pearls of wisdom in a nutshell</segment1>
		<segment2>oh you only live once so you'd better think twice. this day will go before you know so don't waste your time. and when you're standing on a cloud or when you've fallen on the ground. you've gotta have something, something to sing about</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't know much, that much is true. the queries are endless, my answers are few. but life has caused me to conclude. I can face what I don't know. by singing about what I do</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh you only live once so you'd better think twice. this day will go before you know so don't waste your time. and when you're lost inside yourself and you can't find your way out. you've gotta find something, something to sing about</segment4>
		<segment5>the world has a way of wearing you down. and time's not afraid to take its toll, oh no. but you can sing through anything as long as you know. what awaits you at the end of the road. because you only live once</segment5>
		<segment6>yeah, you only live once so you'd better think twice. this day will go before you know so don't waste your time. at the end of the day, when you lay your head down. you've gotta have something, something to sing about    </segment6>
