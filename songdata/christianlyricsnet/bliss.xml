		<segment1>I feel lonely when it's you I miss. I feel crazy when I dream like this. I've travelled all this way for just one kiss. Is it bliss? Is it bliss? Yes it is. Rock 'n roll is everything. Everything to a lonely man. And never will I bow to you</segment1>
		<segment2>I, I'm not backing down. I, I'm not backing down</segment2>
		<segment3>Take me to the place where eagles fly. Where my love for you I never can deny. If I'm right then you are wrong. If I'm wrong then I really lived. And if I die with no reward. Then I know I had peace cos I carried the sword</segment3>
		<segment4>I, I'm not backing down. I, I'm not backing down</segment4>
		<segment5>It's the simple thing that satisfy. Keep my feet on the ground and my head in the sky. I love you more than I can say. And I won't change my mind on the choices I made    </segment5>
