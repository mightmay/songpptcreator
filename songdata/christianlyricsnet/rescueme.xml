		<segment1>When im alone the world is such a different place. Sometimes its hard to keep the smile upon my face. It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down. Its taken so long but now theres one thing that Ive found</segment1>
		<segment2>When everyting starts crashing down. When all I know falls to the ground. When darkness comes and I can't see. You're always there to rescue me</segment2>
		<segment3>Just when I think that Ive got it figured out. You open my eyes and let me see that theres no doubt. But you've got it all within the power of your hand. It seems like the more I know the less I understand</segment3>
		<segment4>When everyting starts crashing down. When all I know falls to the ground. When darkness comes and I can't see. You're always there to rescue me. When all my strength has turned to fear. When I wonder if you're near. When I dont know how to break free. You're always there to rescue me</segment4>
		<segment5>I wonder if Ill make it through this darkest night. I need to know your strength in me gonna win this fight. Im reaching out wont you take my hand show me to the light. I know you're by my side</segment5>
		<segment6>It seems like I try so hard and still I let you down. Its taken so long but now theres one thing that Ive found</segment6>
		<segment7>When everyting starts crashing down. When all I know falls to the ground. When darkness comes and I can't see. You're always there to rescue me. When all my strength has turned to fear. When I wonder if you're near. When I dont know how to break free. You're always there to rescue me. You're always there to rescue me. You're always there to rescue me. You're always there to rescue me. You're always there to rescue me    </segment7>
