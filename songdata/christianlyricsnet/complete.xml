		<segment1>Incomplete it all began. The broken state that I was in. I wished that I was someone else. Cause' I was lost inside myself. I started seeing who I am. The day my life with you began. You clearly solved the mystery. That finding you meant finding me.</segment1>
		<segment2>God, I've fallen to my knees. I'm bowing at your feet. I give you all of me. In you I am complete. It's all because of love. I'm not who I was. I'm who I meant to be. In you I am complete</segment2>
		<segment3>God who doesn't need at all. I heard your voice I felt your call. It's echoing I cannot shake you off. The stars that shine they bear your name. They sing the song that gives you praise. You've captured me. My heart is lifting off</segment3>
		<segment4>God, I've fallen to my knees. I'm bowing at your feet. I give you all of me. In you I am complete. It's all because of love. I'm not who I was. I'm who I meant to be. In you I am complete</segment4>
		<segment5>I've got to tell the world about the things you've done. I want to shout it out, I'm gonna live it now. Amazing grace is why I'm singing</segment5>
		<segment6>God, I've fallen to my knees. I'm bowing at your feet. I give you all of me. In you I am complete. It's all because of love. I'm not who I was. I'm who I meant to be. In you I am complete </segment6>
