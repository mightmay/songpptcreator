		<segment1>I wanna be a rock star. But, I ain't got what it takes. The drive and the determination. And the lucky breaks. I wanna be a rock star. But, I ain't got the face. I wanna be a rock star. But, I ain't got what it takes</segment1>
		<segment2>Seeing my face up on the TV. Hearing my songs on the radio. People waiting all day in line to see me. Doing my pose for Rolling Stone</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, it's alright, yeah it's alright</segment3>
		<segment4>Living lifestyles of the rich and famous. Turning all heads in the music scene. Flying in my own jet plane to Vegas. Riding in a big black limousine</segment4>
		<segment5>Well, it's alright, yeah it's alright</segment5>
		<segment6>No, I ain't got nothing. But, to you I'm something. Something so much more    </segment6>
