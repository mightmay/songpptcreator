		<segment1>Our house wrapped in disrepair, a small mouse peeked out from a hole beneth the stairs. nearby to where my dad sat in his favorite chair, thinking about the gov't and muttering a prayer. so I scattered some oats in hopes she'd stay. and sat still to stop from scaring her away-. but she hurried on her little way. and scurried around my mind. ever since, every day </segment1>
		<segment2>open wide my door, my door, my Lord. (open wide my door). to whatever makes me love You more. (open wide my door). while there's still light to run towards </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm water, you're the dry wood. equal parts misguided and misunderstood. but all the neighborhood. watched a fire burn from where they stood. as the smoke said. &quot;we're not half as bad as G-d is good&quot;. still there's a whisper in my ear, the voice of loneliness and fear, so I say: </segment3>
		<segment4>&quot;devil, disappear!. I'm still (ehh.. technically..) a virgin. after 27 years-. which never bothered me before, what's maybe 50 more?&quot; </segment4>
		<segment5>she came back for the oats. but she brought along a &quot;friend&quot;. (this never ends). the harder the rain, the lower the flowers in the garden bend. (this never ends). I'd rather never talk again. than to continue to pretend. that this never ends.     </segment5>
