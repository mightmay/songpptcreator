		<segment1>Verse 1: Now's the time for all good men. To get together with one another. We've got to iron out our problems. And iron out our quarrels. And try to live as brothers. We've got to try to find peace witihin. Without stepping on one another. And do respect the woman of the world. Remember, we all have mothers</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You gotta make this land a better land. In the world in which we live. We gotta help each man and each woman be better. By the kindness that we give. I know we can make it, I know real well. We can make it, yes we can, can.. Yes we can, I know we can, can. Yes we can, can, a why can't we if we wanna. Yes we can, can</segment2>
		<segment3>I know we can make it work. I know we can make it if we try. Yes we can, I know we can, can. Yes we can, Great God Almighty. Yes we can, I know we can, can. (We can make it work I know we can). (Well)</segment3>
