		<segment1>God of Glory, God of Might. King of Heaven, Lord of Light. Though my ways are less than wise. I come to praise You</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, Master, Savior, Friend. Your mercy seems to have no end. And though all I have to bring is sin. I come to praise You</segment2>
		<segment3>And my righteousness, is as filthy rags. But You exchange them for the good things that You have</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: Lord I want to sing.. I wanna sing you a song, I wanna lift up my voice. As I lift my hands, Lord I make my choice. That from this moment on until the end of my days. I want to offer up my life as a sacrifice of praise, As a sacrifice of praise</segment4>
