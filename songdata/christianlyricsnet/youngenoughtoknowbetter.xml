		<segment1>YOUR INNOCENCE IS ON THE LINE. AND YOU'RE HEADED FOR THAT FRUIT OUT ON THE VINE. TEMPTATION IN YOUR REACH. WHEN YOU TASTE BEFORE IT'S TIME, IT'S BITTER SWEET</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEARN THE HARD WAY. TO CARRY YOUR MISTAKES. THROUGH YEARS OF REGRETTING THE CHOICES THAT YOU MAKE. WHAT YOU DECIDE TONIGHT, WRONG OR RIGHT, COULD. CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER. YOU'RE STILL YOUNG ENOUGH TO KNOW BETTER</segment2>
		<segment3>FAST FORWARD THREE YEARS YOU GOT A HANDFUL OF DREAMS. THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED. IT'S A FULL TIME JOB, NO TURNING BACK. IT'S A LIFE BUT IT AIN'T THE ONE YOU COULD OF HAD</segment3>
		<segment4>REPEAT CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>TAG: I KNOW, YOU'RE NOT A CHILD. BUT IF YOU LOVE EACH OTHER ENOUGH YOU'LL WAIT AWHILE</segment5>
		<segment6>REPEAT CHORUS.    </segment6>
