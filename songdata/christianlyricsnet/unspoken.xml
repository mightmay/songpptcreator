		<segment1>I hear daily news. People cry out for their freedom. My eyes turn to You. Don't they know Lord. You can lead them</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. If we all pray for peace. Change will come I believe. As we face the unknown. God heals us when we're broken. He is there, use your voice. Reach for Him. Make a choice. None of us are alone. Don't leave your heart unspoken</segment2>
		<segment3>God heals us when we're broken. Don't leave your heart unspoken</segment3>
		<segment4>I pray, save our souls. Help us find a new direction. We're lost in the cold. Let Your arms be our protection</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>God heals us when we're broken. Don't leave your heart unspoken</segment6>
		<segment7>Out of the dark. Into the light. He is there for us. With all His might. He has the answers. He hears your prayers. Turn every corner and you'll find Him there</segment7>
		<segment8>Don't leave your heart unspoken</segment8>
		<segment9>CHORUS</segment9>
		<segment10>God heals us when we're broken. Don't leave your heart unspoken    </segment10>
