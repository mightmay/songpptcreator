		<segment1>(Your tradition). I'm getting so sick of creating this music to please you. The way it used to be is the very thing that blinds you.</segment1>
		<segment2>That's why you can't see my God move. Cause this is not then, and I'm not like you.</segment2>
		<segment3>(Damnation). Your excuse for good advice. Their mouths are wide, but you feed them lies. (Reputation). You're full of indecency. You are exactly the portrait they painted you to be.</segment3>
		<segment4>Stereo Child</segment4>
		<segment5>That's why you can't see my God move. Cause this is not then, and I'm not like you.</segment5>
		<segment6>You refuse to speak, and they'll listen.</segment6>
		<segment7>But I won't be predicted. I won't be your stereo. I won't be predicted, never.    </segment7>
