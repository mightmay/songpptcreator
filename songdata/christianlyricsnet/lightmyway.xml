		<segment1>I'll tell You everything I am. I'm lost and lonely. I'm afraid of not knowing when I've lost my way. and now I'm standing still. and I can feel you getting closer. I can feel Your love upon me. will You light my way</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). will You light my way. so I can see the path beyond the light of day. will I ever be the same. will You light my way</segment2>
		<segment3>A fear of losing what I've gained. will You help me let it go, let it go. giving everything I have. I part with nothing that is mine. does this cost outweigh the cure. is it more than worth the prize</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I surrender all and I seek Your face</segment5>
		<segment6>will You light the world. You can light the word. as long as You're in it. as You're in it</segment6>
		<segment7>(chorus).     </segment7>
