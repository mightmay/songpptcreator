		<segment2>Waste my time on lover's quarrels. Speed my breath and hope to stumble. Out of my distrain and still. You Remain </segment2>
		<segment3>My Wall, my Mighty Tower. Be my Shadow come cover me. Till all my enemies cower. Jealous of my King </segment3>
		<segment4>Though the day be laced with trouble. Be the stone o'er which I stumble. Straight into the arms and stay. Where You Remain </segment4>
		<segment5>They said to me I would fall by the wayside. Answer me now. Answer me now </segment5>
