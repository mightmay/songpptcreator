		<segment1>My back hits the concrete. Cold to the nerves. The clouds stretch black and white. Photographs onto the blanket. Of gray that rests above me. Content lying here, I feel so small </segment1>
		<segment2>One moment, silence fills the air. One moment, I can feel you there. Your fingerprints are everywhere. With life on mute, time passes so fast </segment2>
		<segment3>Back to reason. Yet unable to compute the equation. A silhouette of what came before lies beside me </segment3>
		<segment4>One moment, silence fills the air. One moment, I can feel you there. Your fingerprints are everywhere. With life on mute, time passes so fast </segment4>
		<segment5>Whispering crows into the night. Disrupting the cumulus at work </segment5>
		<segment6>One moment, silence fills the air. One moment, I can feel you there. Your fingerprints are everywhere. With life on mute, time passes so fast     </segment6>
