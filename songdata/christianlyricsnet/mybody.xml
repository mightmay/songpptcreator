		<segment1>Who do you think I am I don't play these. games. Not goin' out like that let me explain. Tryin' to save myself don't pressure me. My spirit leads me to celibacy. I have to just be real and I know it's fair. I wanna please my God and I don't care. You can just leave now but if you stay. There's gonna be no other way</segment1>
		<segment2>If this is love then you can take it. If this is not then don't ya fake it. My body is the Lord's temple. Don't mess with me God's property. It ain't that bad if you try to see. His perfect will is all that I need. My body is the Lord's temple. Don't mess with me God's property</segment2>
		<segment3>What part of no don't you seem to. understand. I just can't move that fast it's not His plan. I'm not ashamed to do what I know is right. His yoke is easy and His burden's light. Momma sat me down and she would say. Just trust in the Lord and Him only. No disrespect but I can't be with you. And try to serve the Lord in honesty too</segment3>
		<segment4>My body is God's body. No it ain't your property. Jesus died on Calvary. Just to save someone like me. Who am I to betray His love. Tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna pray fo you    </segment4>
