		<segment1>I can't say what brought me down this far. It's complicated. Face down and bleeding from this war. Could you forget about figuring me out. And be glad I made it. From face down and bleeding from this war. From this war, from this war</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. And it feels like winter. On a perfect summer day. If I convinced my heart to believe my mind. It might just go away</segment2>
		<segment3>I can't say the last time I really smiled. It takes a lot now. When you're face down and bleeding from a war. Well I know exactly where I've been. And I can't go there again. I need a lot more, I need a lot more than thoughts. I need your touch in my war</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>When it feels like winter. Would You come and save the day. When You touch this heart. I know You really love me. And You'll never go away</segment5>
		<segment6>And it feels like winter. On this perfect summer day. 'Cause You convinced my heart to know You really love me. It might just go away. Might just go away    </segment6>
