		<segment1>Maybe I want to take a step. The golds lost its shine but I know. through cracks and the holes theres a shimmer below. Hazy glimpses force me to stay. It all becomes real the moment I say. that Im finally willing. The moment I say Im open. Ive opened up.</segment1>
		<segment2>When I give a little, it sure takes a lot. and its taking everything Ive got.</segment2>
		<segment3>The last straw, final effort made. to manifest what I cant explain. I didnt want to believe. Now its all that I can see.</segment3>
		<segment4>The last straw, final effort made. to manifest what I cant explain. I didnt want to believe. Now its all that I can see.</segment4>
		<segment5>Now open up a piece of me. Ive exposed myself to everything, everything. and rising up infecting me. Im gonna get it right. Im gonna let it all right in.</segment5>
		<segment6>Someone open the gates and let me in. The persistent grinding, now an accommodating fit. Someone open the gate and let me in. Ive been looking for something, and maybe this is it. Cause we just want to find a place in it all. Cause we just want to find a place in it all. Well I just want to find some space in it all. I want to find some space in it. I want to find some space in it all.</segment6>
		<segment7>The last straw, final effort made. to manifest what I cant explain. I didnt want to believe. Now its all that I can see.</segment7>
		<segment8>The last straw, final effort made. to manifest what I cant explain. I didnt want to believe. Now its all that I can see.</segment8>
		<segment9>Now its all that I can see.     </segment9>
