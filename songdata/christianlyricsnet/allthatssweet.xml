		<segment1>I will strike the chord. That's honey to your ears. All that's sweet is yours. I will hum a verse. Of melodies rehearsed. And all that's sweet is yours</segment1>
		<segment2>So here is my offering. Just a downbeat and a string. But to you it's a beautiful thing. And here is what I bring. Only downbeats and a string. And to you. It's beautiful</segment2>
		<segment3>I will strike the chord. That's honey to your ears. All that's sweet is yours. Loveliness you bring. I can't help but sing. All that's sweet is yours</segment3>
		<segment4>When it seems I've broken down. When these chords are frail. You look with a smile and you say it's beautiful    </segment4>
