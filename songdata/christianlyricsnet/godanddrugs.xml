		<segment1>I scrape the glass for crumbs and ask the mirror for some truth. I loaded my body with chemicals, it was no use. Cause retribution's coming for the years of this abuse, And I can't get away and still I can't get close enough to You.</segment1>
		<segment2>You won't go away, But every hit is just a taste. Something scares me in this place. I self destruct for days.</segment2>
		<segment3>It's a constant reminder of what I can and cannot have. The smell, the taste, it's all just fake, the truth is what I lack. So I will keep on running and keep my head above the ground, And I will look for you in places you cannot be found.</segment3>
		<segment4>You won't go away, But every hit is just a taste. Something scares me in this place. I self destruct for days. You won't go away, But every hit is just a taste. Of all the things I need to face. But it's all so fake.</segment4>
		<segment5>&quot;It's okay,&quot; a voice says, &quot;We all look elsewhere.&quot;. It's true, that I look elsewhere, for you.</segment5>
		<segment6>You won't go away.</segment6>
		<segment7>You won't go away, But every hit is just a taste. Something scares me in this place. I self destruct for days. You won't go away, But every hit is just a taste. Of all the things I need to face. But it's all so fake.</segment7>
		<segment8>You won't go away, But every hit is a taste. You won't go away, Still I've been gone for days!.     </segment8>
