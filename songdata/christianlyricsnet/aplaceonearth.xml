		<segment1>Find me a place on the earth. Where a weary man can rest. And listen for your voice. In the turning seasons </segment1>
		<segment2>A quiet place in the world. Where I can bow. And confess that I fear. Where you have brought me, Mysterious God </segment2>
		<segment3>All of my life. You have been with me. My comfort in loneliness. My hope in the dark. All of my life. Lord, please stay with me. Be my sustaining breath. Guardian of my heart </segment3>
		<segment4>My days are passing by. Like falling stars. That blaze across the night sky. Then they are gone </segment4>
		<segment5>But Father, at your side. I will never be afraid. For you have held all my days. In the palm of your hand </segment5>
		<segment6>All of my life. You have been with me. My comfort in loneliness. My hope in the dark. All of my life. Lord, please stay with me. Be my sustaining breath. Guardian of my heart </segment6>
		<segment7>All of my life. You have been with me. My comfort in loneliness. My hope in the dark. All of my life. Lord, please stay with me. Be my sustaining breath. Guardian of my heart </segment7>
		<segment8>Be my sustaining breath. Guardian of my heart </segment8>
		<segment9>Be my sustaining breath. Be my sustaining breath. Be my sustaining breath    </segment9>
