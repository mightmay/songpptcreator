		<segment1>[Verse 1]. Call me crazy but what if we learn. To love our brother for nothing in return?. Oh how the rules would change</segment1>
		<segment2>Reaching out to the ones who need help. Treating them as you first would treat yourself. Now that would be insane </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS]. It may just be crazy enough. To work if we could only love. What if we somehow changed the world?. It may just be crazy enough</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 2]. Is it so strange to think that one day. we will truly see everyone the same. Oh good we be so kind? (could we be so kind?) </segment4>
		<segment5>To sing along when life's playing their tune. And cry with them when their hearts broken in two. Have I lost my mind? </segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]. It may just be crazy enough. To work if we could only love. What if we somehow changed the world?. It may just be crazy enough</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, have I gone mad. Believing that love still has a chance? </segment7>
		<segment8>[CHORUS]. It may just be crazy enough. To work if we could only love. What if we somehow changed the world?. It may just be crazy enough</segment8>
		<segment9>It may just be crazy enough [repeat]    </segment9>
