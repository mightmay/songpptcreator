		<segment1>Our concentration it contains a deadly flaw. Our conversations change from words to blah, blah, blah. We took prescription drugs. But look how much good that did. Well I think I had a point, But I just got distracted</segment1>
		<segment2>Lately it just seems to me. Like we've got the letters A.D.D. Branded into our mentality. We simply can't focus on anything</segment2>
		<segment3>Because its. 17,18,19 routine. And here at 23 it's the same old me. And that one thing of the moment. That we all happen to like will. Only very temporarily. Kinda break the cycle. Of the double edged sword. Of being lazy and being bored. We just want more and more and more. Till it's all we can afford</segment3>
		<segment4>To keep out eyes open for just one more day. To keep on hoping that we'll stumble on a way. To keep our minds open for just one more day. Cause its completely up to us. To maintain consciousness</segment4>
		<segment5>Well no one can possibly listen to this. More that 4 reps is just monotonous. We're losing interest, Losing interest, Losing interest.     </segment5>
