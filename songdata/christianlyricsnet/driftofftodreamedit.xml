		<segment1>As I sit here surrounded, By people and lights. Along with my drink at the bar. Youve been here forever, So clear in my mind. I just dont know where you are. But I know Ill find you, But girl till I do. This is my love song for you</segment1>
		<segment2>Lets hold hands on the porch swing. Under the moon. While the wind through the willows. Plays us a tune. We can lie on a blanket, Out back in the yard. And wish for our future. On a far away star. And youll feel the passion, As time after time. I press your sweet lips to mine. We can dance to the radio, Right up till dawn. Till you drift off. To dream in my arms</segment2>
		<segment3>You might be hundreds, Or more miles away. Or you might be just down the street. But therell be a hunger, Deep in your eyes. That Ill recognize when we meet</segment3>
		<segment4>It might take hours, Or it might talk years. But this is the song you will hear</segment4>
		<segment5>Lets hold hands on the porch swing. Under the moon. While the wind through the willows. Plays us a tune. We can lie on a blanket, Out back in the yard. And wish for our future. On a far away star. And youll feel the passion, As time after time. I press your sweet lips to mine. We can dance to the radio, Right up till dawn. Till you drift off. To dream in my arms</segment5>
		<segment6>And youll feel the passion. As time after time. I press your sweet lips to mine</segment6>
		<segment7>We can dance to the radio, Right up till dawn. Till you drift off. To dream in my arms    </segment7>
