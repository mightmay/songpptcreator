		<segment1>Erase my thoughts. Cancel my subscription. To the things of this world. I open eyes of deliverance. I'm color blind waiting to see. Want to finally say no. And walk away with a smile. Time after time my call is game over. But again and again this cancer spread. Bleeding and spitting guilt and convictions. As I lay in this pit, pit of defeat. Pit of defeat. Time after time my call is game over. But again and again my cancer spread. Bleeding and spitting guilt and convictions. As I lay in this pit, pit of defeat. Once again to try to beat it out. Over and over again. So worn. To watch Him die and smile. At His dismay. His pain my deliverance. My cleanliness a gift of freedom. My walk purified. My peace given by God. Erase my thoughts. Cancel my subscription. To the things of this world I open eyes of deliverance. I'm color blind.    </segment1>
