		<segment1>Leah you can't see. You're frozen by your fear. I know just how you feel. You're running but nowhere. Leah believe me. You're closer than you think. I've painted this picture. And you're right on the brink. But when you fall. You know I'm right there beside you. I'll hold you tall</segment1>
		<segment2>Leah, Leah, believe me cuz I believe in you</segment2>
		<segment3>Leah you see change in everyone but you. But it's never the wrong time. For the perfect thing. So get out - Stop hiding. I know you can be so much more. Can you hear me knocking at your door?</segment3>
		<segment4>Leah, Leah. Jump from where you're standing. It's time to free fall. You already have wings now. Leah believe me cuz I believe in you</segment4>
		<segment5>One day you'll wake up and relize. You've arrived at a place. Too good to believe. You'll look at yourself. And see you are the person. You wished you could be</segment5>
		<segment6>Leah, Leah. Jump from you're standing. It's time to free fall. You already have wings now. Leah believe me cuz I believe in you    </segment6>
