		<segment1>Candle casts a growing shadow. on the carved wooden wall. I look the dark behind the window. and write the vision that I saw</segment1>
		<segment2>In my eyes the revelation. scene of end with glance of grace. Mankind crying for salvation. They are worth of all the prayers</segment2>
		<segment3>Worth of all the prayers</segment3>
		<segment4>Through the gloomy darkened night. I wandered without fear. My soul wrapped in shinning light. as His voice I could hear</segment4>
		<segment5>Like commands given in prayer. &quot;Write, therefore what you have seen. what is now and what will be later&quot;. The day of reconing is near</segment5>
		<segment6>The burden that I bare. Secrets of the prophecy. Divine messager. Reflector of doom</segment6>
		<segment7>Judgment's call I have heard. in the halls of secrecy. And it's name I have shared. the knowledge of my prophecy</segment7>
		<segment8>For all those who has wisdom. to interpret what I say. We are waiting for the Kingdom. and for their souls we must pray</segment8>
		<segment9>The burden that I bare. Secrets of the prophecy. Divine messager. Reflector of doom. Q    </segment9>
