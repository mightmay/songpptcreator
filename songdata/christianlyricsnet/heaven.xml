		<segment1>There are moments in this life. When it's hard to carry on. When I think about my father. And all the loved ones that are gone. Friends and close relation. Somewhere on the other side. They've passed into forever. But the love has never died</segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes this tired old world. Starts bringing my heart down. But I've got to bear the cross. If I want to wear the crown. I often get impatient. As the time keeps dragging on. I've waded through the darkness. Now I'm ready for the dawn. I'm ready for the dawn</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus I want to see Heaven. Where the faithful carry on. I want to see Heaven, Oh Lord. I want to see Heaven. Where the pain of sin is gone. In Heaven, Oh Lord. I want to see Heaven</segment3>
		<segment4>So if I'm living every moment. As if this day was my last. I'll put my treasure where my heart is. And forget about the past. And if Jesus comes tomorrow. I'll be ready to depart. As He leads me to my mansion. I'll be following my heart. Following my heart</segment4>
		<segment5>Repeat Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>I try to go the distance. But it's more than I can bear. They say there's no more crying. And no more dying there. I've held on to the promise. Whosoever will believe. Would have life that's never ending. Well I believe, I believe</segment6>
		<segment7>Repeat Chorus.     </segment7>
