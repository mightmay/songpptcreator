		<segment1>I checked the map to make sure that I got it right. But still I don't know where You're taking me tonight. And I've tried so hard to mix the old life with the new. But there's not in between if I'm gonna follow You</segment1>
		<segment2>There's gotta be a difference. It's gotta be significant. If You're really inside changing my life. You would shine, You would be evident. If there's a difference. There's a difference</segment2>
		<segment3>Here I am, I've got this baggage by my side. But I am ready now to leave it all behind. So I'm taking this moment to tell You I'm open. I'm taking this moment to give You everything</segment3>
		<segment4>We're not meant to be another face in the crowd</segment4>
		<segment5>There's gotta be a difference. It's gotta be significant. 'Cause You're really inside changing my life. And it's so evident that there's a difference. There's a difference     </segment5>
