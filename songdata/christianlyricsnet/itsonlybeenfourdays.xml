		<segment1>- verse 1 -. Im all alone, longing to see you. Cause this airport gray has got me blue. I want to go home. Cause these West Texas plains are far too plain a view. Compared to you.</segment1>
		<segment2>- chorus -. Youd be a sight for my sore eyes.</segment2>
		<segment3>- verse 2 -. Im all alone, longing to see you smile. But my heart knows as time slows, itll be a while. I watch the clock, and the minutes feel like days. So if my watch is right, then my flights still months away.</segment3>
		<segment4>- chorus -</segment4>
		<segment5>- bridge -. And theres an aching in my eyes, because they need to feel your gaze. They just dont realize its only been four days</segment5>
		<segment6>- chorus -.     </segment6>
