		<segment1>Got your freedom now boy. Who do you serve. Took for granted what you, should have preserved. No time left, no time left, to make amends. Keep burning bridges while you're buying your new friends. A day of reflection hits, you're a shell, skin and bones, counting costs. Is it worth your soul. A day of reflection hits </segment1>
		<segment2>It's funny how times can change, rearrange and distance makes. The pain fade away. So important then, doesn't matter now. Both feet on the ground. Come full circle, yeah, come full circle </segment2>
		<segment3>No access granted now boy, you've been denied. Jump a fence to see what's on the other side. Are you wanted, are you wanted. The question is, could second chances mean another impression. A day of reflection hits, your you're a shell, skin and bones, counting costs. Is it worth your soul. A day of reflection hits </segment3>
		<segment4>It's funny how times can change, rearrange, and distance makes </segment4>
		<segment5>The pain fade away. So important then, doesn't matter now. Both feet on the ground. Come full circle, we've come full circle </segment5>
		<segment6>I got one foot stuck in heaven, yeah. One boot stuck in hell. I looked at God, he winked at me. I made this mess myself. Don't be surprised and don't deny. Hear every word I say. Close the door and don't look back or you will fade away </segment6>
		<segment7>It's funny how times can change, rearrange and distance makes. The pain fade away </segment7>
		<segment8>It's funny how times can change, rearrange and distance makes. The pain fade away. So important then, doesn't matter now. Both feet on the ground. Come full circle, full circle, come full circle. We have come, full circle     </segment8>
