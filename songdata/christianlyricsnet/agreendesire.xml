		<segment1>I want to see your eyes. The light, the tunnel. I need to feel your love. This fight, my struggle. Which hand should I cut off? My life in shambles. I'll lose my life right here. But what for, I'm coming home.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I will meet you (there)</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm heading nowhere fast. I need your hands. Which breath will be my last? It's gone, my past. Love with a broken heart. I'm here alone. I'm getting taken away. I hope you're coming soon.</segment3>
		<segment4>And I will meet you (there)</segment4>
		<segment5>Grab my hand and take me home.</segment5>
		<segment6>Will you be there to grab my hand and take me away?</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to see your eyes. I need to feel your love. Which hand should I cut off?. I'll lose my life right here.     </segment7>
