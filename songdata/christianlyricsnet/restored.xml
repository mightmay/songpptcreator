		<segment1>All this time I've wandered around searching for the things I'll never know. I've been searching for this answer that only will be found in your love. And I feel it. My heart is being mended by your touch. And I hear it. Your voice that's shown my purpose in this world</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). You have restored me from my feeble and broken soul. You have restored me</segment2>
		<segment3>I've only come to realize my strength will be made perfect at your throne. Laying all reflections down to see the precious beauty that you've shown. And I feel it. My heart is being mended by your touch. And I hear it. Your voice thats shown my purpose in this world.</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge). Laying all these questions down youve answered what I need. Youve given more than I deserve your making me complete. You give me all these open doors I'm humbled at your feet. To show me what youve done for me.</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>All this time I've wandered around searching for the things I'll never know.    </segment7>
