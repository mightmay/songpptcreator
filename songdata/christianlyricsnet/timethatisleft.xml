		<segment1>What will you do with the time that's left. Will you live it all with no regret?. Will they say that you loved till your final breath?. What will you do with the time that's left?</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, Hallelujah!. Oh, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!. Amen</segment2>
		<segment3>What will you do with the time that's past?. Oh and all the pain that seems to last?. Can you give it to Jesus and not look back?. What will you do with the time that's past?</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, Hallelujah!. Oh, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!. Amen</segment4>
		<segment5>What will He say when your time has come?. When He takes you into His arms of love?. With tears in His eyes will He say well done?. What will He say when your time has come?</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, Hallelujah!. Oh, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!. (Lord be present in all my ways, help me follow You all my days oh Father God). Amen</segment6>
		<segment7>What will you do with the time that's left?. Will you live it all with no regret. Will they say that you loved till your final breath?. What will you do with the time?    </segment7>
