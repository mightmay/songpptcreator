		<segment1>On Monday he wouldn't trust we'd seen Christ. Today Tom saw Your spear-pierced side. Though his mind was not convinced. He couldn't doubt the evidence. He observed Your side and hands. Finding out the way we did. You're risen!. What You prayed about has come to be. It's what King David said in Psalm 16. Christ is risen; that's no myth. Just a mystery that's legit. The world says, the world says love and life are cheap. Maybe now the price will rise. Today Tom saw Ya. He set eyes on You. And the face he just made. It was quite a view. Thomas tried to talk and yet. &quot;My Lord and God&quot; was all he said. All he hoped for had just commenced. He knows graves are not permanent. But grace is!. And One You say's about to comfort me. Though some will say we lack sobriety. That's the witness. That's the gift. That's the Spirit. Class dismissed. The world is, the world is lost and like a sheep. They that have the Christ are wise. Exit the Lord and yet today Tom saw Ya. He set eyes on You and he'll never be the same. He'll get right onto the mission of the faith</segment1>
