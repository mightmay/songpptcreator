		<segment1>At the top of the world, It's so lonely. it's so lonely. Ever since that day we fell, we fell at the tree. And our eyes were opened forever forced to see.</segment1>
		<segment2>With hearts turned, turned away. With hearts turned, turned away.</segment2>
		<segment3>We're naked and so ashamed of it, How dearly we have all paid for this.</segment3>
		<segment4>And the woman's beauty. Wasn't enough to keep her from falling, Falling down from love. The man in all his strength. Stood and watched his blood so cowardly, oh so cowardly.</segment4>
		<segment5>With hearts turned, turned away. With hearts turned, turned away.</segment5>
		<segment6>We're naked and so ashamed of it, How dearly we have all paid for this. We're naked and so ashamed of it, We've been running from ourselves ever since.</segment6>
		<segment7>One day I'll stand before you, One day I'll stand before you.</segment7>
		<segment8>And joy will flood my soul, And all of me will know. I am made whole in you.</segment8>
		<segment9>We're naked and so ashamed of it, How dearly we have all paid for this. We're naked and so ashamed of it, We've been running from ourselves ever since     </segment9>
