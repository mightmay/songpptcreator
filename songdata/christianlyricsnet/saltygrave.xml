		<segment1>Surely death has found me, It has kept a hold of me all this far. My actions will reveal, only time will tell. These passions start to slip away. Memories flash like seconds in a day. I see the world from the outside. There is something to say about being desperate, down and love. Giving a chance to see what it all can mean. There is something to say about being desperate, down and low. Upon my arrival, I either learn to swim or drown. As I struggle for air I see only water. And I reach for anything as I cry for help. I feel my body growing weak. Slipping away, It occurs to me that my cries are worthless. Acknowledging death. I no longer mourn my own loss. And begin to sing praises to the one that has me here. As I sink to my salty grave I drown. No hand to reach for, no ear to listen. Let it be a sweet, sweet sound.. It your ear. I sink to my salty grave. Up to the light I will sing praises, surely we will all die. Up to the light I will sing praises because surely we will all die    </segment1>
