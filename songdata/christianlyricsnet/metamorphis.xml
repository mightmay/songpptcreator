		<segment1>Hello friend, it's been sometime. Since I've sat at your table, and drank your wine. Worldly lies, empty skies. But only you can satisfy</segment1>
		<segment2>Can I be somebody? Not what they want me to be. Just a pale reflection of what you want me to be</segment2>
		<segment3>Sticks and stones, skin and bones. My teflon coat is wearing thin. Worldly wise, synthesised. I'm on the outside looking in</segment3>
		<segment4>Can I be somebody? Not what they want me to be. Just a pale reflection of what you want me to be. That's what I'm gonna be. Can I be somebody? Can I be somebody?. I'm gonna be somebody</segment4>
		<segment5>I know one day, I will be free. My cynical clothing, will fall from me. Flying high in the blink of an eye. Mezzamorphisy    </segment5>
