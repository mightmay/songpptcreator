		<segment1>There is something more. Hello, We're going down the hallway to the door. We know there's something more. Our soul has got a hole, we know, but what's it waiting for?</segment1>
		<segment2>Scattered in the streets like dreams and gasoline. The things we wanna be, are scattered in the streets. And if we're coming clean, we seem to know we're incomplete</segment2>
		<segment3>How do we feel? How do we feel?. My Generation is aching for real. Dying for love, crying for truth. My Generation is aching for You</segment3>
		<segment4>A country of our own, is all we're asking for. A place to call our home, a country of our own. We know it must be close, our souls are searching through the cold, the cold, the cold..    </segment4>
