		<segment1>Someday I'm gonna go out to the country. I'll drive til the hightway ends. Chasing after picture perfect sunsets. To take my breath away. I'm tired of living in the city. The world's got me tied on a string. Wanderlust has overcome me. Like Lewis and Clark I'll dream. There's a million different ways to go. Only God can know where I will call my home</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Love lead me on. Where no one else has gone. Faith keep me strong. Love lead me on</segment2>
		<segment3>The open road can be so lonely. I'm longing for someone to love. If only I could share my new surroundings. Open the doors above. There's a million different ways to go. Only God can know where I will call my home</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Faith keep me strong. Love lead me home.     </segment5>
