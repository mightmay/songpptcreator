		<segment1>I see those hands. You see those hearts. Some are slow to believe. Give me rest from this world. It's going to kill me. Inside I'm falling apart, what will save me?. I never knew I was so dead until I met you. It's almost over. Dry these tears from my eyes. Breathe in me a new beginning. Never let this love fade away. It's almost over. This is the only thing were fighting for. We're gonna make it through the night. When all the hope we had is dead and gone. The only way to remain strong. I will never look back. Give me rest from this world. I never knew I was so dead until I met you. Give me rest from this world. Set me free from my darkness    </segment1>
