		<segment1>I've been picked when I was low. And I never have been left alone. I know it's true. Thanks to you</segment1>
		<segment2>I have had my burdens shared. There've been valleys. That I've been carried through. Thanks to you</segment2>
		<segment3>So I won't let another moment slip away. Right here, right now. I've got to stop and say</segment3>
		<segment4>Thanks to you. I've learned to laugh a little bit harder. Thanks to you. I never cry alone. Thanks to you. I know what it means to have a friend that's true. Thanks to you</segment4>
		<segment5>I remember all the walks. And all the crazy things that I got talked into. Thanks to you</segment5>
		<segment6>. And even now I'm amazed. When I think of all the ways God's voice came through. Thanks to you</segment6>
		<segment7>Through all the thick and thin. And places in between. We have been side by side. And that is why you hear me singing</segment7>
		<segment8>Thanks to you. I've learned to laugh a little bit harder. Thanks to you. I never cry alone. Thanks to you. I know what it means to have a friend that's true. Thanks to you. For never giving up. Thanks to you. For sometimes giving in. Thank you for always listening    </segment8>
