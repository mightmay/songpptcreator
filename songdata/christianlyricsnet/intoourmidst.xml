		<segment1>Let Your love come down into our midst. Let us slowly lose our grip. In the haven of Your grace. Let Your love come down into our midst. Falling sweetly on our lips. Give us more than just a taste</segment1>
		<segment2>Of the glory of Your face, light too bright to hide. When all is broken down to what You are: love personified. If love is sacrifice, and life is giving love. Then redemption is the sum of what You are. And what we're not worthy of. And so we cry</segment2>
		<segment3>Of the sweetness of your touch, unrelenting grace. Whenever you take hold of what we are. We can't be left unchanged. Let this be all we need, and this our one desire. A people who will never get enough. Of everything You are. And so we cry</segment3>
		<segment4>Let Your love come flowing down. Let Your love come flowing down. Will You meet us on the ground?.     </segment4>
