		<segment1>We need You, how we need You. We need You every hour. To see You in Your glory. To know Your spirit's power. There's healing in Your presence. There's mercy where You are. So meet us, won't You meet us. Living God</segment1>
		<segment2>No other God but You. No other God but You. No other God can satisfy. You are our great reward. It's You we're longing for. No other God but You most High</segment2>
		<segment3>Each trial and each temptation. Each enemy we fear. Retreats in resignation. When the living God is near. So we kneel again before You. O keeper of our hearts. And we ask for your deliverance. Living God</segment3>
		<segment4>No other God but You. No other God but You. No other God can satisfy. You are our great reward. It's You we're longing for. No other God but You most High</segment4>
		<segment5>We are leaning on Your everlasting arms. Lord we know You'll see us through. Great redeemer, be the song within our hearts. We'll have no other God but You</segment5>
		<segment6>One day we'll stand before You. When all our sufferings cease. And faced with all Your glory. We'll meet the Prince of peace. But Jesus in that moment. When every trial has passed. We will need You, still we'll need You. Living God</segment6>
		<segment7>No other God but You. No other God but You. No other God can satisfy. You are our great reward. It's You we're longing for. No other God but You most High    </segment7>
