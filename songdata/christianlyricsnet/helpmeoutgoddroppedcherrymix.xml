		<segment1>Help me out God. I need a little something. Turn the brights on. I can't see where we're going. 'Cause I don't know when things'll work out just fine. Or if this road we're on leads us up or is leading me on down. To my wishing well, where I might drown. 'Cause. I can't swim without You, God. Help me out God. I need a little something. Hold my hand. So I know that I'm not falling down or spinning round. Or am I really just fine in this vertigo I feel. Just simply fear or maybe real. It's a long way down. And I might fall. And I might fall. 'Cause. I can't stand without You, God. Help me out God. I need a little something. Just enough so I don't lose hope. Before morning comes. 'Cause in the sun things'll work out just fine. But this night's been extra long. I fear I won't make it to the dawn. 'Cause night is dark. And I might doubt. And I might doubt. 'Cause. I can't hope without You, God. Just enough for today. Get me through 'til tomorrow     </segment1>
