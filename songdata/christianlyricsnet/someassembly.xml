		<segment1>lifted limbs and digits cling to a cloak called. innocent simplicity and a rag doll. and thats all. youre obliged to say whatever. more or less just saving face. after all this time still in the same place. what you take lightly. what you dont care about. but it just might be something beautiful. something you cant live without. when in doubt dont start without taking issue. think again, my friend, on all this. well did you?. Im afraid to say I never. more or less confessed all that. Ive been going through, explained where Im at. it just hit me, some assembly    </segment1>
