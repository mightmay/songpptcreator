		<segment1>Maybe he'll change. Maybe things will get better. Maybe it would be nice. If he wouldn't always put you down. Maybe things will work out. But maybe they'll never. And I think that you've given him. The benefit of the doubt</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You need that boy like a bowling ball dropped on your head. Which means not at all. You have too much to give to live to waste your time on him. You need that boy like a bowling ball dropped on your head. Which means not at all. You have too much to give to live to waste your time on him</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe he'll change. If you could be better. But maybe it's not your fault. He's checking out the waitress now. But someday you'll change. One day you're stronger. And you will have changed enough. And it's time to get out</segment3>
