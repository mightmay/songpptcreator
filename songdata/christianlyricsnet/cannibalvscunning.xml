		<segment1>Im the sadist that reminds you of your blessing, And the reaper that takes them away. To a place where they can lay there, And wilt and rot away. </segment1>
		<segment2>And this cells just as cold as you left it, And Im scratching the walls to escape it. </segment2>
		<segment3>Leave it to the Cannibal now. Feed him whats left of us, the rest of us. Leave it to the Cannibal now. Feed him whats left of us. The Cunning wins again. </segment3>
		<segment4>Im the glorified liar sending you sentiment, And then posing as the innocent. You dont know about ignorance or pain, But you said you could take it away. </segment4>
		<segment5>And this cells just as cold as you left it, And Im scratching the walls to escape it. </segment5>
		<segment6>Leave it to the Cannibal now. Feed him whats left of us, the rest of us. Leave it to the Cannibal now. Feed him whats left of us. The Cunning wins again. </segment6>
		<segment7>You call this inspiration. I call this a charade. Driven by institution. Hell-bent on cleaning the stain. </segment7>
		<segment8>I should grab all these cannibals, lay them all in a straight line, And deny their requests for more, more, more. </segment8>
		<segment9>Leave it to the Cannibal now. Feed him whats left of us, the rest of us. Leave it to the Cannibal now. Feed him whats left of us. The Cunning wins again.     </segment9>
