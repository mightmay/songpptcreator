		<segment1>There must be something else that. all of this revolves around. I appear so small and barely make a sound. Still mysterious these frequencies they draw you out. Looking for some light, see what I'm all about</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: The rest of them are stars. I'm a quasar</segment2>
		<segment3>Passed constellations where so many. wishes have been caught. There you can find me incubating thought. Did you get consolation from a diamond in the sky. Or did he let you down don't stop there tonight. The rest of them are stars. The rest of them are stars</segment3>
		<segment4>Can they know for certain what I can become. I may let down a few or off and surprise some. And as the sun outshines it. seems like I've disappeared. Yet there are these sounds anyone can hear. You'll find me, you'll find me. Moving fastly to illuminate. And brightly and brightly. For the effort from so far away. From the rest of them</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS    </segment5>
