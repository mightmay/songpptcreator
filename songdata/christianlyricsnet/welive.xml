		<segment1>There's a cross on the side of the road. Where a mother lost a son. How could she know that the morning he left. Would be their last time she'd trade with him for a little more time. So she could say she loved him one last time. And hold him tight. But with life we never know</segment1>
		<segment2>When we're coming up to the end of the road. So what do we do then. With tragedy around the bend?</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: We live we love. We forgive and never give up. Cuz the days we are given are gifts from above. And today we remember to live and to love. We live we love. We forgive and never give up. Cuz the days we are given are gifts from above. And today we remember to live and to love</segment3>
		<segment4>There is a man who waits for the tests. To see if the cancer has spread yet. And now he asks, &quot;So why did I wait to live till it was time to die?&quot;. If I could have the time back how I'd live. Life is such a gift. So how does the story end?. Well this is your story and it all depends. So don't let it become true. Get out and do what we are meant to do</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Waking up to another dark morning. People are mourning. The weather in life outside is storming. But what would it take for the clouds to break. For us to realize each day is a gift somehow, someway. So get our heads up out of the darkness. And spark this new mindset and start to live life cuz it ain't gone yet. And tragedy is a reminder to take off the blinders. And wake up and live the life we're supposed to take up. Moving forward with all our heads up cuz life is worth living</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus (to fade)    </segment7>
