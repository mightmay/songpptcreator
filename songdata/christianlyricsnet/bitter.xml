		<segment1>Mother mother can you hear me, i keep trying. Just to find me all i know now, all you s how me, Endless questions, hopeless ending</segment1>
		<segment2>This bitter pill is pushing me away and now i feel. Like there's nothing left to say and i pretend to. Look the other way but in the end will i be okay, Will i be okay</segment2>
		<segment3>Father father will you be there as i cry out. Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper, Numb to this dream sleeing within</segment3>
		<segment4>Before i face another day, won't you let asleep, Lost among the dreams that always comfort me. And before i find my feet, won't you show me. What i need, what i need to walk again    </segment4>
