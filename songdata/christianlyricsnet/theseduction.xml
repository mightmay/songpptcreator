		<segment1>Where did she go I do not know. And which direction was it snowing?. I'll turn around again. Paint over pictures on the wall. I can't believe she gave me alcohol. I thought of Jessebell</segment1>
		<segment2>I hung from a wrecking ball to see a fashion show. I think you know me well</segment2>
		<segment3>Juliet! You know you want it!</segment3>
		<segment4>I've been receiving strange phone calls from the city. I will not extend my hand to the general. And I do not think the people will remember us</segment4>
		<segment5>I hung from a wrecking ball to view a fashion show. I think you know me well</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been jumping over buildings. I've been sleeping in the street. &quot;Mr. Jones&quot; will be right with you if you would just have a seat. Well I'll meet you at the river where we both can clear our heads. I think we would look great dead</segment6>
		<segment7>I've gotten too far to find the princess, she's in another castle. I'm dancing with the Capulet. We're so &quot;crazy in love&quot;</segment7>
		<segment8>Juliet! You know you want it!.     </segment8>
