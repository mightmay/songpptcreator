		<segment1>Anybody in their right mind. Would've given up their preaching and headed for home. They've been warned a hundred times. But something inside them keeps giving them hope. And just when you think they'd be crying. Instead of the tears, there's joy in their eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>What kind of joy is this. That counts it a blessing to suffer. What kind of joy is this. That gives the prisoner his song. What kind of joy could stare death in the face. And see it as sweet victory. This is the joy of a soul that's forgiven and free</segment2>
		<segment3>Anybody else with his pain. Would want to shake their fist at heaven. And give up the fight. 'Cause trouble had been Paul's middle name. Ever since he'd been captured by God's blinding light. But just when his hope should be dying. If you listen you'll hear him singing a song</segment3>
		<segment4>What kind of joy is this. That counts it a blessing to suffer. What kind of joy is this. That gives the prisoner his song. What kind of joy could stare death in the face. And see it as sweet victory. This is the joy of a soul that's forgiven and free</segment4>
		<segment5>What kind of joy is this. The Father has promised His children. What kind of joy is this. That Jesus has come to reveal. What kind of joy could give hope in this world. To someone just like you and me. This is the joy of a soul that's forgiven and free. I've found the joy for my souls is forgiven and free     </segment5>
