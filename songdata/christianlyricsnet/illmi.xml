		<segment1>Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I and you. Illuminati comin' thru. Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I, Ill-M-I and you. Illuminati comin' thru</segment1>
		<segment2>Flow like the Cassius, swing like the Clay. One day, Ima make the whole world pay. With k.o.'s and okay we bash clots-n-dot-dash. You got that right, Ima rock the Morse code tonight. Transmit 'n throwin' fits 'n paparazzi like zits. Get flipped out and squeezed fresh like juicy sun kissed. And if I miss with my missles youre still gonna sizzle. Cause I frizzle fry radiation style worldwide</segment2>
		<segment3>You got your pipeline clogged man get that puppy routed. You got the style down and since you don't know about it. Who's the loser (I am) because we come in numb love. And choicer and did I mention looser (no you didn't). Then I do sir, producer, hit me with the juice. Much obliged got the head of a moose. So mount me on the wall of your livin' room. Sure to bring the boom. Speakin' like a zoom deep into your tomb</segment3>
		<segment4>And if you feel the vibe glide true it's on you. And if you need to drive right through it's on you. And if your screamin' &quot;moi non plus&quot; it's like. What you tryin' to do when you can't fade the true one</segment4>
		<segment5>Eruption type volcanics I got the vocal spurtmatic. Suction cup hands upside the slammin' daily planet. I do windows (on school days) spill Jim Jones (type kool-aid). All these primrose (style bouquets) I clip those (for doomsday). Got succulent flavor, the uprisen Savior. Manifestin' thru these mics, blastin' out your graveyard. Savor every bite that TOBYMAC gave ya. Turn and tell your neighbor this ball-o-dirt is goin' into labor.     </segment5>
