		<segment1>How I long to be like a child again. Nothing to win. Enjoying You enjoying me. Yesterday is gone. Life won't stay the same. How I have changed. But You are and always will be</segment1>
		<segment2>How I long to be like a child again. Nothing to win. Loving You just loving me. Memories aren't enough. Oh how I long for You. And You long too. Right here, right now I believe. Hear me cry</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Please forgive me. Soften my heart I pray. Let me love You tomorrow. Even more than I do today</segment3>
		<segment4>If You willed You would. My aspirings get the best of me. I'm sorry I push You so hard. It's not by might nor power. Holy Spirit consume me. My food is to do Your will. So hear me cry</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS </segment5>
