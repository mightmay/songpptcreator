		<segment1>Who can enjoy being born just to die, I took it this far for love. My feet are hanging over the edge, so catch me so catch me. Take this gun from my hand, I'm giving up till the losing ends. Tears of blood in my eyes, I'm dying to be touched by this white fire. I've let myself fall this far, so catch me, so catch me when the losing ends..    </segment1>
