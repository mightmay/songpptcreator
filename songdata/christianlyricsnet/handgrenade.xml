		<segment1>I need your breath to stay alive and make me feel this way. And I need your eyes to look inside and watch how we collide</segment1>
		<segment2>One more time around and I don't think I'll be allowed. It's the time to tell you</segment2>
		<segment3>Take me, make me, break. Watch me get wicked and drop like a hand grenade. Take me, make me, break. Watch me get wicked and drop like a hand grenade</segment3>
		<segment4>What's up is comin' down. And I hope no one's around when it falls</segment4>
		<segment5>I find it hard to take, sometimes I feel like I could break. And I hope you hear my prayer tonight. Can you hear my cries?</segment5>
		<segment6>Take me, make me, break. Watch me get wicked like a hand grenade. Take me, make me, break. Watch me get wicked and drop like a hand grenade</segment6>
		<segment7>Hey you, tell me what you want me to do. Explode like a hand grenade. Hey man, telll me what you want me to say. I'll drop like a hand grenade. Hey!    </segment7>
