		<segment1>oppressor, homicide, soul destroyer. unmerciful, his goal is to corrupt hearts. breaking, where it hurts the most. targeting with intelligence. destroying the innocent. looking for the depressed. lying, saying there is no chance. he thinks he's the conqueror. but he's the one that's been defeated. so give the battle. by the grace of god. resist him and he will. escape from you    </segment1>
