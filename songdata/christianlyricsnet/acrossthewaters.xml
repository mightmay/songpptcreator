		<segment1>That day I woke up, screaming of emptiness. A thought crushed my mind. To all of them she's just a worn-out dress. They can seek but not find. Time pass please this day of rain. I'm in this world and she's in another. Her fragile voice of sorrow let my brain go insane. I'm in this world and she's in another</segment1>
		<segment2>And You must be my arms around her now</segment2>
		<segment3>We both agreed on this choice. To let me be helpless. And she to stick to your voice. Me to my knees everyday I guess</segment3>
		<segment4>Leave footprints on her/my/our floor tonight. To slumber in Your light. Let her/me/us sleep with angels tonight. Can't even breathe without holding you tight</segment4>
		<segment5>Trade my will against yours. Is something I'd rather say then do. I want to kick down some doors. For me to see through. But she believes in love. Makes this distance pass. She sees the dove. Makes me stay and not trespass</segment5>
		<segment6>And you must be her arms around me now</segment6>
		<segment7>I'll make you a promise. To bring her safe home    </segment7>
