		<segment1>When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll;. Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say, It is well, it is well, with my soul. </segment1>
		<segment2>It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.</segment2>
		<segment3>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come, Let this blessed assurance control, That Christ has regarded my helpless estate, And hath shed His own blood for my soul. </segment3>
		<segment4>It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.</segment4>
		<segment5>My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!. My sin, not in part but the whole, Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! </segment5>
		<segment6>It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.</segment6>
		<segment7>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;. The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend, Even so, it is well with my soul.</segment7>
		<segment8>It is well, with my soul, It is well, with my soul, It is well, it is well, with my soul.    </segment8>
