		<segment1>Guess it's in all those small things. Eyes closed or eyes wide open. Something in the corner of everyone's eye. See or look away again. This time I won't ignore. Not hesitate just adore </segment1>
		<segment2>And I think I'm starting to come alive. Life flooding my veins again </segment2>
		<segment3>Feel I'm coming back to life. I'm falling. Feel I'm coming back to love. This black crow becoming white dove. Feel I'm coming back to life. I'm falling again. I'm falling in love </segment3>
		<segment4>I guess it's in all those great important matters. We all like to bend around. We do our best to ignore. While our hearts is reaching for more. We are not synchronized. We are intellectualized </segment4>
		<segment5>Feel I'm coming back to life. I'm falling. Feel I'm coming back to love. This black crow becoming white dove. Feel I'm coming back to life. I'm falling again. I'm falling in love.     </segment5>
