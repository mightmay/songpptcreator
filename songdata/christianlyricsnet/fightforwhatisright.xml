		<segment1>do you want to get involved?. or do you want to just exist?. dye your hair and spike it up. be another shaking fist. those whiners criers everywhere. &quot;the scene is dead!&quot;. but you don't care. WAKE UP!. this is where it all begins. wasting time. wasting words. ACT NOW!. you'll be heard (x2). WAKE UP!. this is where it all begins!. its time to change. dont be ashamed. unite and fight for what is right. unite and fight for god has raised a mighty army. unite and fight for what is right. unite and fight for jesus christ!. unite!.     </segment1>
