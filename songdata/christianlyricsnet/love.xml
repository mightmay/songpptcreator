		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on 1 Corinthians 13</segment1>
		<segment2>Love is patient, love is kind. No eyes of envy, true love is blind. Love is humble, it knows no pride. No selfish motive hidden inside. Love is gentle, makes no demands. Despite all wrong, true live still stands. Love is holy, love is pure. It lasts forever, it will endure</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). Love knows when to let go. Love knows when to say no. Love grows in the light of the Son. And love shows the world that the Son of Love has come</segment3>
		<segment4>Love is loyal, believes the best. It loves the truth, love stands the test. Love is God sent in His Son. Love forgives all we have done</segment4>
		<segment5>In this world where hatred seems to grow. True love goes against the flow. And becomes so hard to show</segment5>
		<segment6>In this world where push turns to shove. We have strength to rise above. Through the power of His love. Lord, we need to know the power of Your love     </segment6>
