		<segment1>Sometimes things don't work out quite the way. that you wanted them to. Sometimes people don't do all the things. that you wanted them to. There are time when. the answers aren't easy to see. Sometimes we're on a road. going back to a place we never wanted to be</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Well that's alright. I'm just fine. Done made up my mind. that I'm livin for Jesus</segment2>
		<segment3>When I'm alone and feeling down. Now, down so deep in my heart. I turn to Jesus and ask Him. for a brand new start. He's the reason for my life. being something better and new. And now I've finally found a love. that is proven tried and true</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat chorus    </segment4>
