		<segment1>Still you can't win. But you paid and tried for love. So cool then why'd you bother?. Then why'd you stay?. These days are bad. So why'd you ask for the money from her. So cool then why'd you bother?. Then why'd you stay?</segment1>
		<segment2>If nothing at all, you hang, you ride on</segment2>
		<segment3>It'll be alright. With no one at all, it'll be alright. It'll be alright. When no one calls, it'll be alright    </segment3>
