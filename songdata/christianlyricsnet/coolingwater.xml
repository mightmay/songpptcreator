		<segment1>Verse 1</segment1>
		<segment2>My Soul Was Sinking, In A World Of Sin. But Grace And Mercy, It Took Me In. Took My Feet Out, Of The Marry Clay. And Placed Them On, On A Rock To Stay</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh What A Relief It Was. When God Rescued Me, He Loosed The Chains That Had Me Bound. And He Set Me Free</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2</segment4>
		<segment5>Sleepless Night, And So Much Pain. Could'nt See No Sunshine, Nothing But Rain. But God Said. Weeping May, Endure For A Night. But In The Morning, It Will Be Alright</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh What A Relief It Was. When God Rescued Me, He Loosed The Chains That Had Me Bound. And He Set Me Free</segment6>
		<segment7>L It Felt Like. C Cooling Water. L Cooling Water. C Cooling Water. L It Felt Like. C Cooling Water. L Cooling Water. C Cooling Water. C Cooling Water From Grandma's Well    </segment7>
