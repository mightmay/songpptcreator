		<segment1>You're the one who turns my head, You're my God and to myself I'm dead. You're the one by which I'm led, You're the one. You're the one who loves me more than I could see or ever ask for. You're the one that I adore, You're the one. CHORUS. By You, I'm amazed. By You, I'm dazed. By You, I'm crazed. By You, I'm saved. You came you led a sinless life, You suffered on the cross to take away all mine. For me alone You would have given You life, You're the one. I'm so amazed by You. Are you amazed are you?    </segment1>
