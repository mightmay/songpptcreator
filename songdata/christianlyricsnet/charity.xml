		<segment1>Love me. Forget me not. Hold me up Holy Rock. You, who'd passion never fades. Who will never pass away. We see the gifts You bring. How lovely! how lovely! </segment1>
		<segment2>Charity holds her head in different ways than i'd imagined it. In laurels of glory. In all of the things she says. I'm bound to hang my head. In laurels of glory </segment2>
		<segment3>Love me. Forget me not. Hold me up Holy Rock. You, who'd passion never fades. Who will never pass away. We see the gifts You bring. How lovely! how lovely! </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS </segment4>
		<segment5>Whisper. Say my name. All i've dreamed. Remain unchanged. From the heavens out to here. So inspired and so clear. I hear Your voice and sing &quot;how lovely, lovely!&quot; </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS </segment6>
		<segment7>Poke my finger in Your side. And give an eye to how the blood it drips. Who am i to ever doubt?. Open my mouth and hope to shout. Heyya! </segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS </segment8>
		<segment9>    </segment9>
