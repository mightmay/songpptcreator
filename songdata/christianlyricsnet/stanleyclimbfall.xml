		<segment1>quiet. seems like an honest world. you're begging for the baker's bread when the money's out. stand, climb, and fall. you carry the world. can't carry your hope</segment1>
		<segment2>when the world is falling down. and another breaks. and another falls. for losers always make the winner's day</segment2>
		<segment3>stand, climb, and fall. you carry the weight. can't carry it all</segment3>
		<segment4>are you falling. are you faking. are you killing. are you breaking. am I burning. am I only melting. these diamonds in the making</segment4>
		<segment5>when I'm at the end of myself. everything you want. when nothing seems to satisfy me. take anything you want</segment5>
		<segment6>quiet. a sound you know so well. you're living just to make it through another day. stand, climb, and fall. you carry the world. can't carry your hope</segment6>
		<segment7>are you falling. are you faking. are you killing. are you breaking. am I burning. am I only melting. these diamonds in the making</segment7>
		<segment8>when I'm at the end of myself. everything you want. when nothing seems to satisfy me. take anything you want. take anything you want. take anything you want</segment8>
		<segment9>quiet    </segment9>
