		<segment1>I don't know what I did to make you smile. but it's sure been a while since I've been able to pull that off. So when you coming down tonight?. Go out and have a good time. If we can find a little something to do. When everything changes it's nice to have something that stays the same. I don't know what I did to make you laugh. but it's sure been a while since I've been able to crack you up. There's just a lot we never talk about. And I don't know what to feel until I know what you think. And I don't think you are set on anything.     </segment1>
