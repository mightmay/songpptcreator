		<segment1>Given this day, my life as a sacrifice. To the God that reigns forever, I lift my voice, with my mouth I will praise you, for you are worthy to be praised. With my feet I will stand before you, and my hands I will raise. Oh God, I have left this world. Crossed Over, eternal life my reward. I sense your fight. Your pride comes before your heart, this world is not worth eternity in hell. But you're so proud, so proud of being lost. I choose to live for God, I have crossed. Hebron I have crossed over.    </segment1>
