		<segment1>There is freedom within, there is freedom without. Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup. There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost. But you'll never reach the end of the road. While you're traveling with me</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof. My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof. In the paper today tales of war and of waste. But you turn right over to the T.V. page</segment3>
		<segment4>Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us. We know they won't win</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum. And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart. Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof. Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief</segment5>
		<segment6>Hey now, hey now. Don't dream it's over. Hey now, hey now. When the world comes in. They come, they come. To build a wall between us    </segment6>
