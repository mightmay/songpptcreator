		<segment1>Whatever it takes. To keep me tender toward You. Whatever it takes, Lord. I beg You to do. Whatever You must lead me through. Whatever it takes, Lord .. do</segment1>
		<segment2>At times I hear your voice and try to hide. But patiently you draw me to your side. I may not always see. That Your words are life to me. So many times I've missed You. Help me, Lord, to not resist You</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes my heart gets hard and I can't see. That Your correction is protecting me. But as I look within. The darkness of my sin. Breaks my heart and leaves me tender. Gratefully I then surrender    </segment3>
