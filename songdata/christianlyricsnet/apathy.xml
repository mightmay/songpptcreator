		<segment1>Blind, blind to your apathy. Your spit straight from the mouth of God. You use God's grace to justify your sins. You sit complacent, letting your friends dies. Die. Sit on the couch, and watch the news. See all the wrong paths people choose. Keep to yourself, the answer in you. Not allowing Christ to work through you. Now is the time to make a difference. Be strong in the Lord, make the best of every chance. Never will we ever be strong, until we stand together, and help your friend move along. It's time that we have a burden for those that are lost. It's time we make a difference, planting your cross.     </segment1>
