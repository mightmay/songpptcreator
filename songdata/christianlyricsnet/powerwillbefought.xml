		<segment1>i rip the label off my forehead, the one that you conveniently placed, to keep me under your thought control, this time the enemy will be faced, there's no way this injustice will go unnoticed, i'm not a percent, i'm not a number, ignorance has become comfortable for you, close minded complacency, but, were bringing it down, tearing you out of your comfort zone, and standing up for what we know is right, you didn't expect independent thought, you never expected intelligence, were bringing it down and the whole system too, you've judged me ahead of time, it seems futile for me to fight, so i could accept the label that is mine, but i am not a stereotype, no, i'm not a stereotype, my strength comes from Jesus Christ, and my faith is as hard as rock    </segment1>
