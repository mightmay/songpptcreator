		<segment1>I'm walking a new walk. Never be the same again. Dancing a new dance. In Your Holy Spirit rain. Your breath of life has overwhelmed me. And set my spirit free</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm living a new life. Underneath Your morning star. Running a new race. In the shadow of Your love. Your love is immeasurable. Too deep to comprehend</segment2>
		<segment3>My Jesus, dream maker. My Jesus, life giver. I'm living under the kiss of heaven. And I'll never ever be the same again</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm singing a new song. In the presence of my King. Giving You my heart. That is all that I can bring. You lit a fire inside of me. That I thought would never burn again</segment4>
		<segment5>My Jesus, dream maker. My Jesus, life giver. I'm living under the kiss of heaven. And I'll never ever be the same again. I'm living in the embrace of heaven. And I'll never ever be the same again</segment5>
		<segment6>I thank You, my Father. For all You've done and all You are going to do. My past behind me, You before me. I press on for more</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm living in the embrace of heaven. And I'll never ever be the same again</segment7>
