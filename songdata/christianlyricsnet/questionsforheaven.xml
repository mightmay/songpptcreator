		<segment1>Feel the sun in my eyes. Swat that clumsy fly. Woke me up from a dream about Heaven. Smellin' coffee downstairs. Yawn a quick little prayer. And get up at a quarter to seven</segment1>
		<segment2>Mirror catches my stare. Got some nice pillow hair. And I smile all the way to the bathroom. Scratch my whiskery chin. Now my cranium swims. With questions I can't wait to ask You</segment2>
		<segment3>..Like why did You bother with so many stars?. Do You ever play tricks on the angels?. And what happened to all of those dinosaurs?. Where's the Garden of Eden?. And what causes de ja vu?</segment3>
		<segment4>I guess in Heaven I'll learn. I'll be waiting my turn. To ask about quasars and feathers. I hope the line isn't long. I hope Your patience is strong. It's a good thing forever's forever</segment4>
		<segment5>Do our jokes make You laugh?. What's Your favorite cartoon?. Can you tell me what's out past the edges?. And what about UFOs, taste buds, and tornados?. Why do we dream?. Oh, and what causes de ja vu?</segment5>
		<segment6>Time to call it a day. Time to turn off my brain. It's already half past eleven. Reach to turn out the light. And close my sleepy eyes. And save up the questions for Heaven. I'll save all the questions for Heaven. I'm saving up questions for Heaven    </segment6>
