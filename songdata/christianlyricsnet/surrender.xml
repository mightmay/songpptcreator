		<segment1>My hands hold safely to my dreams. Clutching tightly not one has fallen. So many years I've shaped each one. Reflecting my heart, showing who I am. Now you're asking me to show. What I'm holding Oh so tightly. Can't open my hand; can't let go. Does it matter?. Should I show you?. Can't you let me go?</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Surrender, surrender. You whisper gently. You say I will be free. I know but can't you see. My dreams are me, My dreams are me</segment2>
		<segment3>Say you have a plan for me. And that you want the best for my life. Told me the world has yet to see. What you can do with one. That's committed to your call. I know of course what I should do. That I can't hold these dreams forever. But if I give them now to you. Will you take them. Away forever?. Or can I dream again?    </segment3>
