		<segment1>Countless are the days, since I last heard your voice, but I still have this sound of your voice in my ear. And I ask myself when will I see you again. The only thing I have left are your letters, written (with love) in blood.</segment1>
		<segment2>Meanwhile my eyes are almost blind and my ears are almost deaf, I still hope that I will find you at the right time 'cause i know this for sure. You will deliver us from this time of sorrow, no matter what it takes.</segment2>
		<segment3>You fulfill your plan and you fill my heart with love.</segment3>
		<segment4>your intention is to bring us together, we don't know how that works. we ignored you, even after all you said, but now it's time to accept this masterplan.</segment4>
		<segment5>You fulfill your plan..</segment5>
		<segment6>Count on his words, he has never failed. Take this revelation, open this mystery.</segment6>
		<segment7>You fulfill your plan..     </segment7>
