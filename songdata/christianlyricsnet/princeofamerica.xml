		<segment1>Living a life, without any future. Just unending appetite, for petty amusement. And you with your woes. You've food on the table. You've cash in your pocket. So why are you crying. Prince of America, hay does your tears run so rampantly. Are you not satisfied, in your world without context?. Where everything's trivial, and nothing has meaning. Not even the throne you're heir to. Prince of the world</segment1>
		<segment2>So much to see, so much information. The people in Kosovo, the villages burning. It's all entertainment, quickly forgotten. It doesn't make any sense to me. So why are you crying. How could you know which rung you stand on?. You never had to make the climb. You never thought to look beneath you. Ignoring the throne you're heir to. Prince of the world Prince of America    </segment2>
