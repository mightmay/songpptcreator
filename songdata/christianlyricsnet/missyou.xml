		<segment1>vs1. he was her first love. she was his first heartbreak. she didnt trust him. that was her second big mistake</segment1>
		<segment2>she took a lover. she took the medicine. she took another. but all she thought about was him</segment2>
		<segment3>and the smile that was on his face. as she walked away</segment3>
		<segment4>ch. i miss you. i need to. cause when im back in your arms its twice as sweet</segment4>
		<segment5>vs2. she threw her hair back. in a prophetic turn. it was expected. it was a swift and lovely blur</segment5>
		<segment6>and compelled as she was to leave town. she was turning around</segment6>
		<segment7>ch</segment7>
		<segment8>bridge. love is calling my name. love keep calling my name. love    </segment8>
