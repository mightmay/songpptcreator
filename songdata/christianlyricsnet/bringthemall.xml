		<segment1>Shine into the darkness. Shelter all the cold. Father all the orphans. Give life to the old. Go into the cities. Harvesting the fields. Go seek out the hungry. Where the pain s real</segment1>
		<segment2>Bring them all to me. Call them by their names. Love them one by one. Do not be ashamed. Go and find my children. Go and set them free. Tell them that I love them. Bring them all. Bring them all to Me</segment2>
		<segment3>Go across the desert. Go across the sea. Go across the border. Walk across the street. Touch and heal the lepers. Search and find the lost. Show them what My love is. Go despite the cost</segment3>
		<segment4>Go proclaim salvation. Go and bring good news. Go and make disciples. Go without excuse.     </segment4>
