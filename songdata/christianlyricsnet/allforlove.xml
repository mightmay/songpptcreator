		<segment1>All for. Love. For love was crucified </segment1>
		<segment2>All for love a father gave. For only love could make a way. All for love the heavens cried. For Love was crucified </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh how many times have I broken your heart. But still you forgive if only I ask?. And how many times have you heard me pray?. Draw near to me </segment3>
		<segment4>Everything I need is You. My beginning, my forever. Everything I need is you </segment4>
		<segment5>Let me sing all for love. I will join the angels song. Ever Holy is the Lord. King of Glory, King of all </segment5>
		<segment6>All for love the Saviour prayed: Abba father have your way. Though they know not what they do. Let the cross draw man to you    </segment6>
