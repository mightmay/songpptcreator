		<segment1>Intro: isaiah 41:23 &amp; 24</segment1>
		<segment2>The roots deep of this wicked tree. They're reaching out seeking to change me. It's struggle enough not live for my &quot;self&quot;. Gotta lift up God for he is deserving so well. All this &quot;humanity&quot; and the power it claims. Has turned from God to pursure it's own way. To do what God does through it's own strength?. I see a storm coming - chaos this way</segment2>
		<segment3>The lies, distorted truths. So many lies. Surrounding you</segment3>
		<segment4>You look to yourselves. To bring you deliverance from hell. To lift yourselves into the place of God. Convince yourselves that you cannot be stopped</segment4>
		<segment5>You'll stop yourselves</segment5>
		<segment6>Environmental, racial conscience so high. Your claims are nothing when the fire has died. Starting off with that strong p.m.a. (positive mental attitude). Your education's only partial and then you fade. To make a change you gotta lay down your pride. Only God can make those changes inside. Pride is a fire that burns with no name. Careful now that you are not the moths drawn to it's flame    </segment6>
