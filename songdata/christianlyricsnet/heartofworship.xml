		<segment1>When the music fades and all is stripped away and I simply come. Longing just to bring something thats of worth. That will bless your heart</segment1>
		<segment2>Ill bring you more than a song for a song in itself. Is not what you have required. You search much deeper within through the way things appear. Youre looking into my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Im coming back to the heart of worship. Its all about you, all about you Jesus. Im sorry Lord for the thing Ive made it. When its all about you, all about you Jesus</segment3>
		<segment4>King of endless worth no-one could express. How much you deserve. Though Im weak and Im poor all I have is yours. Every single breath    </segment4>
