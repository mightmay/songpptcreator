		<segment1>To come around and lose yourself. To know a different life. To know that time will pass you by. We've learned to change but did we change to learn. Is this our so called imitation. To carry on with no convictions. We have the calling of another life. Another way to live. We are the ones We are the ones to blame</segment1>
		<segment2>So Wake Up! Now it's time, this is all we have. This is the sound of revolution. So Get Up! Get Up!. To the tune of the voice inside. This is the calling of a new life</segment2>
		<segment3>Now that we know familiar scribes. The motion of our lives. We realize our actions. Let's stop and make this happen. Here we are with so much confidence. But in the end will we be falling suddenly. And find our lives are nothing but the opposite. Of something confident. We are the ones. We are the ones to blame</segment3>
		<segment4>So Wake Up! Now it's time, this is all we have. This is the sound of revolution. So Get Up! Get Up!. To the tune of the voice inside. This is the calling of a new life</segment4>
		<segment5>Wake up there's no more time to waste. Today is the day</segment5>
		<segment6>We are the ones. We are the ones</segment6>
		<segment7>This is who we are. Now all rise. To who we are inside    </segment7>
