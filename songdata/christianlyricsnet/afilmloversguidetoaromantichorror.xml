		<segment1>These leaves fall as the trees burn to ashes. Another moment of second guessing. Interpretations. Every sentence. Every word. Every gasping cry. You, I, who, we die. </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm sorry darling because love will soon be dying. </segment2>
		<segment3>Your eyes. A bitterness of few disguise. Nothing better configured than you here with me. So thanks for your assistance on the new flesh wound. These tulips do catch up as I die for you. </segment3>
		<segment4>My Heart. You Hand. This love. The end. </segment4>
		<segment5>I'm sorry darling because love will soon be dying</segment5>
		<segment6>Just hold your breath. Breathing is easier when you're not conscious</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm sorry darling because love will soon be dying</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm dying now.     </segment8>
