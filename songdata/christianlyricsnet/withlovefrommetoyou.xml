		<segment1>Make the world new, Things you dream to do, With love from to you</segment1>
		<segment2>Well Ive had a thousand dreams, but never one like this. And Ive felt a million things, but. never felt quite, quite, like this. So tell me, whats your name?. And whats inside that heart of yours?. Tell me everything, just talk and Ill listen, Just talk and Ill listen.</segment2>
		<segment3>Come love, see the earth spin, Watch the colors collide, with hope at our side, All that is mine, with love from me to you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Girl, tell me whats your dream, and Ill be there, To serve your every need, yes, your every care, All I have is his, and all I have Ill give.</segment4>
		<segment5>Morning meets with songs, sung like Ive never heard, And all the smells, and sights, that bright my life, Cant contain this joy unheard. So tell me, whats your name?. And whats inside that heart of yours?. Tell me everything, just talk and Ill listen, Just talk and Ill listen.</segment5>
