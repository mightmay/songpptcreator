		<segment1>All the girls in the bathroom talkin. who they gonna take to the Sadie Hawkins. My ears are burnin but I kept on walkin. smile on my face and air guitar rockin</segment1>
		<segment2>The Sadie Hawkins Dance. in my khaki pants. There's nothin better. oh oh oh. The girls ask the guys. it's always a surprise. There's nothin better. baby do you like my sweater?</segment2>
		<segment3>Sittin in the back of my next class nappin. Got up, gave a speech, then bowed to the clapping. Told a funny joke got the whole class laughin. think I got a tan from the light which I was baskin</segment3>

		<segment5>Scan the cafeteria for some good seating. I found a good spot by the cheerleaders eating. The quarterback asked me if I'd like a beating. I said that's one thing I won't be needing. And since I'm rather smart and cunning. I took off down the next hall running. Only to get stopped by a girl so stunning. only to get stopped by a girl so stunning</segment5>
		<segment6>She said, &quot;You're smooth, and good with talkin. You go with me to the Sadie Hawkins&quot;</segment6>
		<segment7>The Sadie Hawkins Dance. in my khaki pants. There's nothin better. oh oh oh. The girls ask the guys. it's always a surprise. There's nothin better. baby do you like my sweater?</segment7>
