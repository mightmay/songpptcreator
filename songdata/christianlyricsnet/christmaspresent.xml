		<segment1>What a perfect ending. To this film we are watching. Cause she loves her boyfriend. Like he has loved his girlfriend.</segment1>
		<segment2>Just like the night sleeps on by, Just like the sun wakes the sky. They are so in love. Like we are so in love</segment2>
		<segment3>So hug it tight and embrace it. Dont let the world deface it. Just let it shout with amazement. As we dance tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>Just like the cold becomes spring. Just like the perfect day dream. Just like your pretty eyes gleam. We are so in love</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh-ho-whoa</segment5>
		<segment6>[Silence]</segment6>
		<segment7>Please mister spare some change. For a poor broken man in need. Im sick and dying walking barefoot. Please just buy me a drink</segment7>
		<segment8>The truth is that Id like to die. But I fear of where I could go, thats real. Cause take a look; Im so drunk, stupid, and worthless. For some Jesus you feel, thats real</segment8>
		<segment9>So let me get this straight. Cause I have a question. Youre saying hed listen if I were to speak. Yes thats what Im saying, in fact I was just thinking. Hes probably thinking of asking you the same very thing. He wants to say &quot;youre okay, be my friend. Let me help you and take you out of this lake that you are clearly drowning in. Make me yours and Ill make your mine</segment9>
		<segment10>So hey, listen up friends. Good news is coming, Soon is the end of all the worlds troubles. And all of its sin. I said hey, listen up friends. Oh, good news it coming, Soon is the end of all the worlds troubles. And all of its sin    </segment10>
