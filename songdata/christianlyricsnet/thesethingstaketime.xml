		<segment1>I wanna know why pain makes me stronger. I wanna know why good men die. Why am I so afraid of the dark ?. But I stray from the light</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna know why you gave me eyes. When faith is how I see. And tell me. Is it easier to doubt. Or harder to believe</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh theres so many questions stirring in me</segment3>
		<segment4>And I wonder why. Sometimes the truth aint easy to find. I wanna know all the answers. But Im learning that. These things take time. Yeah, these things take time</segment4>
		<segment5>How could success make us feel like failures?. And the harder we fall the harder we try. The more I have the more I need. Just to feel like Im getting by</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, theres so many questions and one short life</segment6>
		<segment7>And I wonder why. Sometimes the truth aint easy to find. I wanna know all the answers. But Im learning that. These things take time. Yeah, these things take time</segment7>
		<segment8>And we spend so much time. Chasing our tails, hoping to find. Every last answer. To everything in life</segment8>
		<segment9>So many questions. Not enough time</segment9>
		<segment10>But Im still. Wondering why. Sometimes the truth aint easy to find. I wanna know all the answers. But Im learning that. These things take time. Yeah, these things take time</segment10>
		<segment11>Hey!. We all wanna understand why. Evil lives and good men die. On the way to Heaven the truth unwinds. These things take time. These things take time. Yeah, these things take time    </segment11>
