		<segment1>by Bob Hartman. Based on Rom. 13:11</segment1>
		<segment2>One moment gone into the past. But here and now will never last. You made the most of your design. You've walked alone. You held the line. That's when you know you've passed. The test of time </segment2>
		<segment3>The time has come, the time has gone. The time is now, but not for long. Before you take a second glance. Redeem the time and take a chance. It's not too late to pass </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). The test of time. And the time is passing every moment that you take. The test of time. It's the test of choices that you have to make. It's what you're doin' and how you're livin'. It's how you're spending the time you're given. The test of time </segment4>
		<segment5>Tomorrow is a chance that may not come. Today is still the day God gives us. To see things done. Your own test of time has begun </segment5>
		<segment6>Time will slip away. Every moment passing by. The choices that we make will stand the test of time. Time will slip away. Every moment passing by. The choices that we make will stand the test of time     </segment6>
