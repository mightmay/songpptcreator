		<segment1>God of love You came to earthBorn in a manger, the incarnate WordFull of grace, and full of truthYou healed the leper, You made all things newReligion despised Your word of loveCondemned You to die in Your innocenceCondemned You to die in Your innocenceA crown of thorns and mockeryWere Yours my Savior, my precious KingStrained with blood and bruised with painThe Lamb of God on a cross of shameNever before and never againWas love so great, was death so grimThere on the hill You died for meYou took my sin gave me libertyI'll never boast but in Your crossAnd all my gains I now count as lossWhen sins they rob my heart of joyWhen condemnation seems to steal even moreThis I recall, You rose againAnd I rose with You, Hallelujah amen.So if I live in want, or die in shameTo live is You and to die is gainI in You and You in meMy God, my brother, my identityWere I tempted with the best of earthAll its pleasures and all its goldAnd if fame in all its kingdomsWas in my hands to holdI'd scorn it all for You've given meThe treasure of Your SonAnd now I'm richer than the richestFor You've given me Your love    </segment1>
