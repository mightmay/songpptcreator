		<segment1>Your hands held up the world, Your heart bled on a hill. And now there's no resistance. and I want to go where there's no resistance. I want to go into Your heart, I start to see where there's just You and there's no me. So into Your heart is where I'll be, into Your heart. He drew the world and colored it red. with the blood of His Son and the words that He said. And now there's no resistance. and I want to go where there's no resistance. I want to go into Your heart, I start to see where there's just You and there's no me. So into Your heart is where I'll be, into Your heart. I'm not here anymore, I'm leaving the ground. Now there's no esistance.     </segment1>
