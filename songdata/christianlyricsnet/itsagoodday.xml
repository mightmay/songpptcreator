		<segment1>However long our feet have walked on this world. We've all lived long enough to know. That sometimes life will go our way. And other times it won't. But still I've got this joy inside of me. With each new dawn I do believe to</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Say hey, it's a good day. Even if things aren't going my way. Jesus is Lord and I am saved. So, say hey, it's a good day</segment2>
		<segment3>Circumstance and situations change. You know life can turn on a dime. But there's a constant hope and peace. That I have come to find. And it's all because of who God is. And that He is alive and I am His, so</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>We are all as happy as we make our minds up to be. I have just decided that nothing's gonna take this joy from me</segment5>
