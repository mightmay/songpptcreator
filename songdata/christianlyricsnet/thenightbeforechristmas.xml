		<segment1>It was the night before Christmas and all through the world. Everything looked like business as usual. Shepherds sat on a hillside looking up at the stars. While the world fell asleep unware just how deep. Was the darkness the night before Christmas</segment1>
		<segment2>And the night before Christmas it seemed to be just a night. But the wind blew like something was coming. And like children with secrets that they're bursting to tell. The cedars danced in the breeze while all of nature it seemed. Held its breath on the night before Christmas</segment2>
		<segment3>And hope, hope long awaited. The hope of the ages. Would break with the dawn. And the song that all of creation was anticipating. Would start with a baby's first cry</segment3>
		<segment4>And on the night before Christmas Mary laid down to rest. While Joseph, he paced the floor praying. And in an everyday stable, in an everyday town. In the hours to come God would wrap Himself up. And come down from heaven and the world would forever be changed. After the night before Christmas</segment4>
