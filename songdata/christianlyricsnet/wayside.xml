		<segment1>In a time of doubt. pieces hidden so they can't be found</segment1>
		<segment2>i won't reward your whole life for this time. you can't afford to make claims that won't take they won't take</segment2>
		<segment3>if you're looking for my heart you're in the wrong direction</segment3>
		<segment4>hold tight, forget something that makes you feel nothing. that's right, you held on to whatever you wanted. you got stopped at the border without your family. shaken into order you backed down barely. pause at the nearest wayside, make it out with an honest face hide</segment4>
		<segment5>you've been warned your life till this night. bite your tongue to save face to displace. a note to self. the coat you wore well. your blurry eyes they can't decide who to follow.     </segment5>
