		<segment1>First class, the movie is boring. I look out over the snowy peaks. There's a passenger missing and. The flight attendants are acting rather strange. A stewardess is telling us everything is fine. &quot;Everybody stay calm everything is fine&quot;. Now the rumors rise without delay. Sheer speculation. But I'd really like to know. What's going on inside the plane. Mid-flight. Soaring into this winter night. While the captain keeps the lid tight. On what's really going down. Stowed away. A saboteur in the cargo bay. Carries a gun, he's lost his head. He's not afraid to go down. Snowstorm, bombarding the hilltops. We're caught in the mix-up. I look out into the fog. We're shrouded in a sheet, stuck shaking. And swerving off course. I hear the captain's voice. &quot;Please stay in your seats. We're experiencing turbulence, stay in your seats&quot;. Now the tension rises without delay. Sheer paranoia. But I'd really like to know. Who's in control of this plane. &quot;Attention!. Failure in two of the engines. I propose we abandon ship. 'Cause this one's going down&quot;. But the flight crew. Reports to the cockpit. &quot;Bad news, there's bulletholes in the parachutes. We're not getting out&quot;. Chaos in the sky. A rocky landing on a mountainside. Now we're buried in the snow. Wake up, most others are still unconscious. And things look hopeless. But at least I'm still alive and not alone. It's daybreak. I watch as the others slowly wake. To a desperate situation, then I hear someone call out. &quot;Look around us. There's silhouettes on the mountains. The choppers have finally found us. Now we're going home&quot;. We're going home     </segment1>
