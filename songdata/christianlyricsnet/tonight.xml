		<segment1>Starry, starry night. The silver beams the only light. Summer breeze, summer dreams. Float over me. The stars frame her silhouette. Beauty steals away my breath. This moment will last forever, forever. Forever </segment1>
		<segment2>There is no time but now. There is nowhere else but here </segment2>
		<segment3>Time has lost its grip tonight. Beautiful enchantment. I just might hold her, hold her close. Never let her go. The tenderness in her eyes. Her hair is drenched with silver moonlight. Half-spoken thoughts. Forget-me-nots. She's the jewel I've sought </segment3>
		<segment4>There is no time but now. There is nowhere else but here. When all else is cold. The warmth of holding her near </segment4>
		<segment5>Tonight the stars in her eyes. Outshine the stars in the sky. Tonight love is in her eyes. I'll hold, hold her close tonight     </segment5>
