		<segment1>Say it ain't so joe here we go so. Writing words that'll flow drop another verse til I'm old. Hit 'em with a fat groove make 'em jump back. Ain't givin' in 'cause we cut 'em no slack. 'Cause the reason that we're here. is to open up your ears. Make you face all of your fears through the years. Gonna let you know what we're all about. Gonna make you jump up, gonna make you scream and shout. But not yet cuz it's not time. So let me finish up this little rhyme. Cool, funk flow here we go step aside. Cause we got something to do here tonight. We've spent a lot of time, not knowing what we're missing. Picking up the pieces of a broken heart wishing. That we could be moving on up. to the best side, that's the heavens in the sky </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>I just wanna go. Jah will take me home. I just want to show this love that you should know</segment3>
		<segment4>Just waking up to a new day Got to step to the mirror 'cause I want to look the right way. Step back to the Word see what it has to say. Before I face another day. Ephesians 6:10-20 talks about putting on armor. You gotta wear it cuz the devil, he will harm you. So everybody take it to another level. Get 'em up and stomp the devil</segment4>
		<segment5>Bringing it back to the way love's supposed to be. We give you this song so you can clearly see. That your problems can be solved if you put your trust in Him. His oceanic love can take away your sin. So listen up Jah people if you wanna take the ride. You gotta feel the love, you gotta catch the vibe. A love that's never changing is what we came here to show. We're here to tell you all about a love that you should know     </segment5>
