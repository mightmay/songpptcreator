		<segment1>What makes you think you're fooling me?. Do you think I was born yesterday?. When I look at you all that I can see is what you try to be. Why can't you just stop acting like you care?. Cause you don't know what you're saying. Nothing keeps you up at night. Cause you don't know what you're saying, but you think it's right. You try to pretend that you're still my friend, but I know you're not. All those times you said you would be there. Just go lie to someone else now. I can see right through your shallow lies. You can't fool me no more.    </segment1>
