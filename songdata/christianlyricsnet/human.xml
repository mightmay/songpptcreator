		<segment1>Verse 1: Every life has a choice. To rise up to fill the void. Every heart has a mission. And we are called to be human </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: We gotta do better than this cuz we only got. One chance to make a difference. We gotta do better than this cuz we only got. One life that we've been given. A little love, a little kindness. A little light in this time of darkness. It'll be what makes us different. It'll be what makes us human. I'm human, you're human, we are human </segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: We are marked with His image. And we are scarred with indifference. Maybe now we should listen. Hear the cry of God's children </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: We gotta do better than this cuz we only got. One chance to make a difference. We gotta do better than this cuz we only got. One life that we've been given. A little love, a little kindess. A little light in this time of darkness. It'll be what makes the difference. It'll be what makes us human. I'm human, you're human, we are. We are human. I'm human, you're human, we are. We are human </segment4>
		<segment5>Gotta do better than this cuz I only got. One chance to make a difference. Gotta do better than this cuz I'm only. Just one </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm human, you're human, we are. We are human x2 </segment6>
		<segment7>It'll be what makes the difference. It'll be what makes us human    </segment7>
