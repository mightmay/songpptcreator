		<segment1>Record player spins. Takes us back to when. Passion first arrived. Everyone else is bored, everything is a chore. But I feel fine (just like you). Can you hear the rain. Tap the window pane. Just the way we like?. Everyone else is inside. Come on, lets go for a walk or </segment1>
		<segment2>Go for a ride, streets are. Calling our name. We are never afraid of what may chase us. We ride on </segment2>
		<segment3>A picture that you paint. Captures everything. Record player spins. Takes us back to when. Passion first arrived. Everyone else is bored, everything is a chore. But I feel fine (just like you) </segment3>
		<segment4>Maybe we should take it back. Everyday we take it back. Every time we take it back. This passion stays alive. Everyone else is inside. Come on, lets go for a drive. Every time we bring it back this passion stays alive    </segment4>
