		<segment1>I Will Be Here. Track #5 on the album &quot;More To This Life&quot;. (NOTE:  This format observes lyrical &quot;commas&quot;. and fits perfectly on an iPhone screen.)</segment1>
		<segment2>Tomorrow morning. if you wake up. And the sun does not appear. I, I will be here. If in the dark. we lose sight of love. hold my hand and have no fear. 'Cause I, I will be here</segment2>
		<segment3>I will be here. When you feel like being quiet. When you need to speak your mind. I will listen. And I will be here. When the laughter turns to cryin'. Through the winning, losing and trying. We'll be together, I will be here</segment3>
		<segment4>Tomorrow morning. if you wake up. And the future is unclear. I, I will be here. As sure as seasons. are made for change. Our lifetimes are made for years. So I, I will be here</segment4>
		<segment5>I will be here, And you can cry on my shoulder. When the mirror. tells us we're older. I will hold you. And I will be here. To watch you grow in beauty. And tell you all the things. You are to me. I will be here</segment5>
		<segment6>I will be true. To the promise I have made. To you and to the One. Who gave you to me</segment6>
		<segment7>I, I will be here. And just as sure as seasons. are made for change. Our lifetimes are made for years. So I, I will be here. We'll be together. I will be here    </segment7>
