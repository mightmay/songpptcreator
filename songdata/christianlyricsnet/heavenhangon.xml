		<segment1>He yells through the night. With a face full of fight. Stepping over the ring that she wore. She runs for the car. But she doesn't get far. His boots kicks her hand from the door. And there on her back. She let's go of the last. Remnant of hope that she's held. Heaven hang on. She can't hang on anymore. Heaven hang on. She can't hang on anymore</segment1>
		<segment2>Two houses down. There's a man pulling out. With a pistol pushed under the seat. And he's waving good by. To his boys and his wife. And ends that are too far to meet. He's got a plan. The insurance man. Sold him the way out they need</segment2>
		<segment3>Heaven hang on. He can't hang on anymore. Heaven hang on. He can't hang on anymore</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, surround them with angels. And send out Your saints. Shake us all loose. From our pulpits and pews. To hold and to help up the faint. Heaven hang on. (Use my hands, Jesus). We can't hang on anymore. Heaven hang on (Use my hands, Jesus). We can't hang on anymore. We can't hang on anymore. We can't hang on anymore     </segment4>
