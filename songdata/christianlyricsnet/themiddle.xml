		<segment1>It's as if you could find me anywhere. That I could go, to try to hide my thoughts from you, But just like some runaway I'm leaving here. With half a mind that hopes, of getting caught. So we can just drive home in the dark where we'll let our feeling fly. they'll cut like shame to break me down again. Until there's nothing left but for me to tell you I'm sorry</segment1>
		<segment2>But I dont wanna go home now. Stuck here in the middle alone now. Everybody's singing their song now. But I'm still reeling. I'm not trying to run away from. this beautiful life I've been given. I'm not looking for freedom. Maybe just a little meaning. Here in the Middle</segment2>
		<segment3>It's as if there's a word uncovered by the break of day all these miles away but for a better view. of what's left in the aftermath of all these years. It's just so hard to know who I am in you</segment3>
		<segment4>So I dont wanna go home now. Stuck here in the middle alone now. Everybody's singing their song now. But Im not ready for this. I'm not trying to run away from. this beautiful life I've been given    </segment4>
