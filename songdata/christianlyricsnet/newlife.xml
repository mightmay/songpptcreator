		<segment1>Seperation from this world. I'm sick of my ways. And there's only one cure. To live my life, for the one who died. Change my ways, live for Christ. Away from sin, be strong and win. My new life, this is my new life. Dead, I die to this world. To live my life, with the Lord. My rewards are great, in him I find my peace. My new life, this is my new life. Separation from this world. I'm sick of my ways. And there's only one cure. To live my life, for the one who died. Change my ways, live for Christ. Away from sin, be strong and win. My new life, this is my new life. This world has gave me nothing, to live for Christ I live for something. Changed my pace, and I'm winning the race. My goals in sight, I have seen the light.    </segment1>
