		<segment1>Come into my world. Come crashing through the ceiling. And find the messy rooms, the scattered pearls. If you are brave enough then come into my world</segment1>
		<segment2>Come into my world. So lovely from the outside. So dark in here the demons dance and twirl. And find their pleasure frightening this girl. If you are brave then come into my world</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). Cause I never saw the changes come. Or knew enough to run when this old house had come undone. And now Im buried in the walls. And no one comes to call but you. Come into my world</segment3>
		<segment4>Come into my world. I can not find the doorway. Its overgrown with vines that twist and curl. If you are brave then come into my world</segment4>
		<segment5>Come into my world. Therell be no other invitation. Not another sound another word. Nothing more than youve already heard. Please be brave and come into my world</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat Chorus    </segment6>
