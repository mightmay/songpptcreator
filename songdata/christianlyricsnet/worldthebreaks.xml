		<segment1>I see it everyday. We say its only living. Like life is only pain. I see heartbreak on every face. Hurt we cant erase. Dreams that fade away. Like were all just lost at sea </segment1>
		<segment2>We need, we need an answer, a hope. And an end to the searching. We need, we need a portrait of grace. Just one steady thing. In a world that aches. In a world that breaks </segment2>
		<segment3>Somehow before life began. You saw broken man. But You had a perfect plan. You would send your only Son. The Holy gift of love. And He would be enough. To erase all the pain of man</segment3>
		<segment4>You are, You are the answer, the hope. And the end to the searching. You are, You are the portrait of grace. Youre the one steady thing. In a world that aches. In a world that breaks</segment4>
		<segment5>You are, You are the answer. You are, You are the answer. You are, You are the answer. Jesus, You are     </segment5>
