		<segment1>Prop open the door I can actually see my breath tonight. But that doesn't mean I'm breathing. Crack a smile just for the sake of it. This could take a while. A long while</segment1>
		<segment2>Silence is golden especially in this case</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm not too sure that I want it to be this way. Open mouth closed eyes. No words are escaping</segment3>
		<segment4>It's all a blur. It's too dark to see. Ain't it pretty the way it all streaks together at night</segment4>
		<segment5>I think its time to turn around. I really want to go home tonight</segment5>
		<segment6>I feel like this is going nowhere. Try to think of something quick. And trust the direction of the driver</segment6>
		<segment7>No lights. No signs. I'm at a loss for words</segment7>
		<segment8>Now conversation sparks. What an easy way to break the ice    </segment8>
