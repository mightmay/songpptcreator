		<segment1>Can you feel the silent cries. Over solemn need. Underneath the city lights. They're altars in the street. Through the walls I hear the sound. Of a beggar's plea. Looking for salvation from. The altars in the street </segment1>
		<segment2>And it's so sad. People drifted away on a concrete sea. It's too bad. Faded lives </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Burn, won't you burn in me. Eternal flame won't you light my name. Burn in me. If God is grace then bless the child. Who's left alone tonight, Set him free, Free to fly </segment3>
		<segment4>Cause it's so sad. People wasted away in such a subtle display. It's too bad. Sacred lives </segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>If I stayed close to. Everything you once held onto. And I know, yeah I know. Sometimes you hurt </segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>Burn, won't you burn in me. You're my eternal flame why don't you light my name. Burn, burn, burn    </segment8>
