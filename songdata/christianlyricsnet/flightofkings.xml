		<segment1>Twenty two years have passed by. As I contemplate. I can recall you getting me out of every scrape. What comes first to my mind. Was the change that I so desperately needed to make. Day and night, frozen silent in blinding violent fear. A song for my fight. Comes spilling the words I so desperately needed to hear</segment1>
		<segment2>Do you know this song's for you?. My heart goes out to hurt you feel</segment2>
		<segment3>What hurts more than just dying. Is living barely alive. After all it's easier than falling short every time. I felt the pain and set fire. To the grace that I so desperately needed to take. Day and night, frozen silent in blinding violent fear. A song for my fight. Comes spilling the words I so desperately needed to hear</segment3>
		<segment4>Do you know this song's for you?. My heart goes out to hurt you feel inside. Do you know this song's for you?. My heart goes out to hurt you feel</segment4>
		<segment5>I was brought up through the ashes. Like a phoenix birthing wings. And I will fight for my disasters. I will take the flight of kings. And if your life is ever torched. Or if you know the pain I sing. Then will you sing with me this chorus. And we will cut through people's hearts and free them</segment5>
		<segment6>Do you know this song's for you?. My heart goes out to hurt you feel inside. Do you know this song's for you?. My heart goes out to hurt you feel    </segment6>
