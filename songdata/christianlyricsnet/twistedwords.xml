		<segment1>Have you ever noticed. How people twist the. Words that you have said. To them funny how these. Things occur taking it. Literally all the thins. You've said not looking. In to deep in the. Meaning of what they've. Read twisted words. Causes ignominy twisted. Words changes what. Things used to be it. Happens every day. Without it they would I. Just can't come to see. Why they aren't sick of it. All on and on they twist. The things tell me will I. End words will change all. The same with the. Messages you send.     </segment1>
