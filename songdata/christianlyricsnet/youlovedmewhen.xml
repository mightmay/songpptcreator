		<segment1>Call me prodigal. Call me anything You like. I've spent so long in the darkness. I'll do anything to step into the light</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't expect You to love me. I don't expect You to need me</segment2>
		<segment3>I tried my best to run away. But You say that none of it matters to You. You loved me when I lost my way. Cause You say that none of it matters to You</segment3>
		<segment4>Call me prodigal. Call me broken and ashamed. Call me anything that I deserve. Cause I don't deserve my name</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't expect You to want me. I don't expect You to love me</segment5>
		<segment6>And I'm lost without You. Cause I'm holding on to You. Just when I start to doubt. I find You waiting, You're still waiting    </segment6>
