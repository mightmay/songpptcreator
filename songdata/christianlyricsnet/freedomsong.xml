		<segment1>Praise to the Lord, our chains are gone. Cant help but sing our freedom song. Praise to the Lord, our chains are gone. Cant help but sing our freedom </segment1>
		<segment2>I am a child from a broken home. Where true love was torn apart. But then I met a Heavenly Father. Who made a home inside my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>I am a man with the chains of addiction. Dragging me down for way too long. But I came face to face with redemption. And now those chains are gone</segment3>
		<segment4>Can anybody hear me?. Does anybody know what Im talking about?. When youve been delivered like that </segment4>
		<segment5>Youve got to shout it out. Lift your hands up in the air. Shout Hallelujah. Lift your hands up in the air. I have been set free </segment5>
		<segment6>I am a sixteen year old daughter. Lost in the mirror, no self esteem. But God made me in His image. And that makes me a beauty queen</segment6>
		<segment7>I am a wife and the mother of three. Trading my dreams for a busy life. Searching for my lost identity. And Im happy to announce that I found it in Christ</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Praise to the Lord, my chains are gone. Cant help but sing our freedom song. Praise to the Lord, my chains are gone. Cant help but sing our freedom song</segment9>
		<segment10>Chorus</segment10>
		<segment11>. (Psalm 142:7, Psalm 149:1-5, Revelation 19:4-5)     </segment11>
