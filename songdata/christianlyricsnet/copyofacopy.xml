		<segment1>She told me dont let them in. Youre a copy of a copy. She told me dont come again. This is awful. This is all wrong. </segment1>
		<segment2>Now I feel it coming back again. Slide down the walls, on the floor. Oh, Ill pretend this isnt happening this time. </segment2>
		<segment3>She told me, stop listening to the voices, and what they said. She told me dont fall again. I am wretched, I am loathed. </segment3>
		<segment4>She told me, dont kill the villains. The pain is not escaping. She told me, dont kill the villains. Just let them feast on their own perfection. She told me, dont kill the villains. The pain is not escaping. She told me you cannot stay. But Im stable. Im okay. </segment4>
		<segment5>I said it, we all regret it. Now this room is cold and spinning. Give us cause to keep them breathing again this time. She told me dont let them in. Youre a copy of a copy.     </segment5>
