		<segment1>Well he's a chick magnet, if ya know what I mean. The way the girlies just go to him. Well ya should've seen. The guy yeah, he's got style and it's plain to see. Smooth shoes and cool tattoos. Hair pomped as tight as can be </segment1>
		<segment2>He ain't got a girlfriend. No one to sing this song to. He's gotta settle down. If he meets that special girl soon </segment2>
		<segment3>He knows just what to do. When it comes to the girls. He writes them poetry. And he picks them flowers. He knows just what to say. When it comes to the ladies. Knows how to make a girl smile. How to drive a girl crazy    </segment3>
