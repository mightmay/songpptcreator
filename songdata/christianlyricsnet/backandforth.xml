		<segment1>Late at night all alone in the bathroom. You're freaking out cause you just can't control everything. That happens around you. Set in stone with no proof of validity. Your so-called faith keeps you terrified in anything. That threatens your standing</segment1>
		<segment2>The eyes of the world, the eyes of the church, the eyes of your peers. The wagging of tongues, whispering shame, upon eager ears</segment2>
		<segment3>Have all the plans that you laid out so carefully. Fallen short of your neo-Victorian fantasy. You cling to so desperately. So look at all your hard work is coming to. Despite your effort you still can't buy security. So what is your money worth?. And maybe it's right and I should feel pain for bending the rules. But I'm not the one who's trying to choose between fools</segment3>
		<segment4>Back and forth the orchestra plays. But neither side is tuned to the other. Back and forth the orchestra plays. But neither side is tuned. . .</segment4>
		<segment5>Pull the shutters and tighten the blindfold. Turn away anyone who doesn't fit the mold. The story goes untold. Despite the righteous beliefs that you profess. You still can't cover the stain that marks your Sunday dress. No need to confess</segment5>
		<segment6>Back and forth the orchestra play    </segment6>
