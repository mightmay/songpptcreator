		<segment1>sometimes i feel so lost and so alone. just like the bird who cannot sing. i need the joy You bring. and ill wait for You til well be. going home. . fly away, flay away. oh how i long just to see the light. of day. just like the man who cannot see. i need You close to me. so ill wait for You, til well be. goin home. . holdin on, i keep holdin on. when morning comes. theyll look. and ill be gone. my longing heart wont be deceived. cause i know Youre coming back. for me. so ill wait for You, til well be going home. . so ill wait for You, til well be going home    </segment1>
