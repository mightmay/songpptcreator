		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman</segment1>
		<segment2>Long-distance run from darkness. Headed into the sun. And it seems like eternity. Till this race is won. Soul and spirit weak and weary. Strength was was almost gone. When a soothing gentle breeze carried me further on</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). I've got my second wind, Spirit's coming again. I've got a new revelation from the King of Kings. Found my second wind, feel my strength returning again. Returning again</segment3>
		<segment4>Through a desert night in darkness. Racing toward the light. There were too many hills to climb. And too many battles to fight. Then distant lights were calling. Beckoned me as a guest. When I found the oasis there. I entered into a rest</segment4>
		<segment5>Just when I thought I couldn't run any longer. I got my second wind. Just when I thought I'd never be any stronger. I got my second wind. Just when I thought that I would fall into darkness. I got my second wind. Just when I thought that I would fail every test. I got my second wind     </segment5>
