		<segment1>The message still the same. The prayers always change. A vivacious group of friends, one thing that we share. </segment1>
		<segment2>End result is life. Forever isnt long. when you cant measure time. Everlasting pride. </segment2>
		<segment3>Seems youve heard this message. a hundred times before. The point is that we need to live forevermore. No agony in discourse. No wallowing in dread. The choices that you make will matter when youre dead! </segment3>
		<segment4>Weve always got our friends. to gather in this fight. Theres pressure coming in, from every shape and size. </segment4>
		<segment5>Now is not the time. to fall bellow the mark. We have to be protective;. we have to stand up strong. </segment5>
		<segment6>The bridges that were crossing, will never be rebuilt, no time for resentment, or living with our guilt, for starings sake take a glance, at what we can adjust.    </segment6>
