		<segment1>Daydreaming again. Trying to get my mind together. Seeing what could be. Will it take forever</segment1>
		<segment2>Let me have this moment. Let me take this moment for myself. Silence oh so sweet. Silence shared with someone else</segment2>
		<segment3>Wanting to escape. I close my eyes. And all the day's confusion. Just passes by</segment3>
		<segment4>My only release. Is to call on You. A comforting conversation. A message is getting through</segment4>
		<segment5>This is my time this is my time. This is ours to share. This is my time this is my time. This is my time    </segment5>
