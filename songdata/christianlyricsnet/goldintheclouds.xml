		<segment1>Even when the rainbows seem to pass right by me. I'm still finding gold in the clouds. Through all the shadows and the patterns of doubt. I'm still finding gold in the clouds. There, I said it again </segment1>
		<segment2>Even when the eastern sky fills up with light. I don't see the sun 'till you're there. Even when the moon comes out to play at night. I don't see the light 'till you're there. There, I said it again</segment2>
		<segment3>I wonder if I were in someone else's shoes. Would I be like them, or would I still be me?. I wonder when I'm old if I will understand. Everything I say. I sure hope it's that way    </segment3>
