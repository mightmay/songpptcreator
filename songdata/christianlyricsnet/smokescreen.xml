		<segment1>I almost can't stand to watch, as we are made to suffer. In a scene run by fashion, and what label you are on. Wake up, look around, at what your living for. Wake up, look around, what are you living for. It's not a popularity contest for you to judge. It's about what's in your heart, and what you can believe in. I've seen your game, one thousand times before. You're nothing new, we know what you will do. You lie inside, you hide behind your girls, your money, they won't mean a thing. I won't play your game. I will never be like you. Lying to everyone, lying to myself. Now we are, right here, tell me what you believe. We won't let you, tell us who we really are    </segment1>
