		<segment1>Glory Baby, You slipped away. As fast as we could say baby, baby. You were growing, what happened Dear, You disappeared on us baby, baby. Heaven will hold you before we do. Heaven will keep you safe. Until we're home with you. Until we're home with you </segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). We miss you everyday. Miss you in every way. But we know there's a day. When we will hold you, we will hold you. And you'll kiss our tears away. When we're home to stay. We can't wait for the day. When we will see you, we will see you. But baby let sweet Jesus hold you. Â‘Til mom and dad can hold you. You'll just have heaven before we do. You'll just have heaven before we do </segment2>
		<segment3>Sweet little baby, it's hard to understand it. Cause we are hurting, we are hurting. But there is healing. And we know we're stronger people. Through the growing and in knowing. All things work together for our good. And God works his purposes. Just like he said he would. Just like he said he would </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>I can't imagine Heaven's lullabies. And what they must sound like. But I will rest in knowing. Heaven is your home. And it's all you'll ever know. All you'll ever know </segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus).     </segment6>
