		<segment1>I know it cuts you inside every time that you try. To take a pathway in life that leaves you so unobliged. Every promise is lies, every smile makes you cry. Leaves you so unalive, so unalive. I wish I could take the fall. Maybe by that I could solve. The problems we're all having. It's been a while since you've felt like you've been home. Your life's just flesh and bone </segment1>
		<segment2>Your heart is worth more than you know. The one thing that hurts more than your life. Is to wake up one more time alone. It's to wake up one more time alive </segment2>
		<segment3>So take us in, we'll stop you dead. We'll show you something you won't ever forget. This life's a road, no place is home. My heart's a hole. That needs to constantly be filled with love </segment3>
		<segment4>This time it's all that I've got. Words hit the page like gunshots. My stomach's left in a knot. My pride is left here to rot. It's been a while since I've felt this restless. By definition it's depressing but I'm alright. It kills to wake up one more time alone. It kills to wake up one more time alive </segment4>
		<segment5>So take us in, we'll stop you dead. We'll show you something you won't ever forget. This life's a road, no place is home. My heart's a hole. That needs to constantly be filled with love </segment5>
		<segment6>I know the feeling of being all alone. So let's drink to fact that we're not. I know the feeling of being all alone. So let's drink to fact that we're not </segment6>
		<segment7>So take us in, we'll stop you dead. We'll show you something you won't ever forget. This life's a road, no place is home. My heart's a hole. That needs to constantly be filled with love    </segment7>
