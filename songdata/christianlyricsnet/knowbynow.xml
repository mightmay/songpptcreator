		<segment1>So it all went wrong. I started singing that sad, sad song. So convinced that I was on my own. But God I know. That You wont leave. Guess I let it slip my memory. Fast as I could count to 1 2 3. Forgetful me</segment1>
		<segment2>Whoa, whoa, here I go again. Why do I forget, Youre always faithful. Whoa, whoa, how many times have I seen. You give me just what I need. Whoa, whoa, here I go again. I forget, Youre gonna work it out somehow. You think that Id know by now</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, Id like to learn to live by faith. As the flowers of the field might say. Worry doesnt add a single day. Oh, God I pray. Youll help me see. When Im looking at my history. All the ways Youve taken care of me. I want to believe but</segment3>
		<segment4>Whoa, whoa, here I go again. Why do I forget, Youre always faithful. Whoa, whoa, how many times have I seen. You give me just what I need. Whoa, whoa, here I go again. I forget, Youre gonna work it out somehow. You think that Id know by now</segment4>
		<segment5>That You are always in control. I should know by now. That Youre gonna work it out. But this shadow of a doubt. Wont let me go</segment5>
		<segment6>Whoa, whoa, here I go again. Why do I forget, Youre always faithful. Whoa, whoa, how many times have I seen. You give me just what I need. Whoa, whoa, here I go again. I forget, Youre gonna work it out somehow. You think that Id know by now.     </segment6>
