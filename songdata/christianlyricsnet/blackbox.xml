		<segment1>The plane is starting to smoke. I think that everyone knows. That this thing will soon be going down. Some people think that we'll choke. Some people think there is hope. Which will it be?</segment1>
		<segment2>When we know we see the ending. Quickly fading, we see that we're dying. I know it's a tragedy. That sometimes people can lose their wings. Now we're crashing down, what will they see?. When there's nothing left, who are we?</segment2>
		<segment3>It's going down like a flame. There's no one out there to blame. We made our choice and now there's no more time. The black box is hearing the hope and the fearing. What will it say?</segment3>
		<segment4>When we know we see the ending. Quickly fading, we see that we're dying. I know it's a tragedy. That sometimes people can lose their wings. Now we're crashing down, what will they see?. When there's nothing left, who are we?</segment4>
		<segment5>After all the smoke has cleared. There's only one record that they'll ever see. Our black box says it all, it tells them who we are. who we are..</segment5>
		<segment6>When we know we see the ending. Quickly fading, we see that we're dying. I know it's a tragedy. That sometimes people can lose their wings. Now we're crashing down, what will they see?. When there's nothing left, who are we?</segment6>
		<segment7>Who are we.. Who are we..     </segment7>
