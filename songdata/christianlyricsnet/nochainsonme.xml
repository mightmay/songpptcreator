		<segment1>This is the dream, a dream for the world to see You. A dream for the world to know You, to love Your name</segment1>
		<segment2>Lift up a shout, lift up a cry to shake the ground. Shout and the walls are coming down. Yeah, we're running after You</segment2>
		<segment3>Like a rolling stone, like a runaway train. No turning back, no more yesterdays. My heart is free, no chains on me. God, You raise me up, up from the grave. The cross before, I'm on my way. My heart is free, no chains on me</segment3>
		<segment4>Now is the time, now is the time for freedom. Abandoned by cold religion, my heart on fire. We hear the sound, the sound of revival coming. The sound of Your people rising. Yeah, we're running after You</segment4>
		<segment5>The walls are coming down    </segment5>
