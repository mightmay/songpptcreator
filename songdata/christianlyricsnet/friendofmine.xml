		<segment1>the boys are growing up too fast to realize. times are changing and some have thrown away their lives. little alex packed his hopes and dreams today. did he care at all no he threw it all away</segment1>
		<segment2>we used to say those were the days. you promised you'd never go away. you left it all behind without saying goodbye. where did you go oh friend of mine</segment2>
		<segment3>she was my best friend now i don't know where she went. i wonder did she care about the way i felt that day. a simple note she wrote were her last words to me. all i am to her is just an empty memory</segment3>
		<segment4>we used to say those were the days. you promised you'd never go away. you left it all behind without saying goodbye. where did you go oh friend of mine</segment4>
		<segment5>those were the days we long for and now we want them back. condescending on the past. and those were the days we thought that forever they would last. now you know i want them back</segment5>
		<segment6>so many heartaches so many broken hearts. another tear drops down as my mind goes ticking off. where the children playing in the streets today. remember where you came from don't let it slip away</segment6>
		<segment7>we used to say those were the days. you promised you'd never go away. you left it all behind without saying goodbye. where did you go oh friend of mine. where did you go oh friend of mine    </segment7>
