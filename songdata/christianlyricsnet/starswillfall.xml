		<segment1>When there's no breath in my lungs to scream. And there's no strength left inside of me. When there's no light that my eyes can see. I will say Your name, I will say Your name</segment1>
		<segment2>And stars will fall like rain. All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake. Every mountain will be moved and cast away. At the mention of Your name. At the mention of Your name</segment2>
		<segment3>When hope is a long lost friend. And the broken that was meant to bend. Lift the wounds that were never mend. I will say Your name, I will say Your name</segment3>
		<segment4>And stars will fall like rain. All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake. Every mountain will be moved and cast away. At the mention of Your name, oh. At the mention of Your name, oh</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus, I cry, Jesus. Jesus, I cry, Jesus</segment5>
		<segment6>And stars will fall like rain. All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake. Every mountain will be moved and cast away. At the mention of Your name, oh</segment6>
		<segment7>And stars will fall like rain. All the Heavens and the earth will start to shake. Every mountain will be moved and cast away. At the mention of Your name. At the mention of Your name. At the mention of Your name    </segment7>
