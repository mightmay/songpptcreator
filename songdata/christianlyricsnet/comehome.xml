		<segment1>All my hopes and dreams came true today. My life wont be the same. You opened up my eyes and let the healing begin. You brought me hope within.</segment1>
		<segment2>You took away the chains that once held e down. Now I can hear you say..</segment2>
		<segment3>Come home, come home. You're calling me into your arms. I've been gone for so ong. I can hear You calling out my name.</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't believe how much you sacrificed. You chose death to give me life. I wont cry for myself anymore. I've found what I've been looking for. You were with me all this time.</segment4>
		<segment5>You've been watching me for so long. I can hear you alling out my name.</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been waiting, anticipating, patiently waiting for you.    </segment6>
