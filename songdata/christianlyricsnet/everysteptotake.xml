		<segment1>Every debt you face can be removed through grace. Every law you break can be fixed through faith if you want them to. Every sinful way can be cured today. Every stain will fade -- they'll be wiped away if you want them to. Oh, can't you see? You'd be wrong to flee. While the good Lord waits till every soul is saved. If you move too late there's a price you pay. There's no time to waste -- get a clean, new slate cause He wants you to. Sinned so long Id be lost without His grace. cause Jesus Christ is the only way that saves. You're lookin' 'round for a truth you can embrace. He'll fill your soul with a strong enduring faith. At least try Him, baby, baby please. Oh, can't you see -- Second Peter 3?. How the good Lord waits -- till every soul is saved. If you use true faith, if you bow to pray. Use your mouth to say Jesus' name today cause that's what to do. He'll remove your shame, just confess His name cause thats what to do. Cause He wants you to.     </segment1>
