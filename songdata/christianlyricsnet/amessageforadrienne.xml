		<segment1>i tried so hard to be her day. but the night has already taken me away. shedding dreams under the maple tree. where i carved your name. nothing left, not even time. straight reads the line. his life had reached the end. wanting only to be loved by adrienne. latters explained his grief. but she would never read. his wrists would bleed. but she would never see. so he took his life at the age of 23. and she had always loved him. be he would never know. for she covered her love. like stars cover the sky. hiding her heart. fearing what he would find inside. years took her away. a widow she remained. holding him deep inside. wishing she too would die. time favors no one and if we wait. we too can fall in love. a second too late    </segment1>
