		<segment1>This world is a stage. Broken bones, no regrets. This world is a stage and everyone seems to have their opinion. Stick around, stay for a while. I am chocking on someone else's blood and the fingertips of God. So stick around and let me tell you about it because far too many don't say. </segment1>
