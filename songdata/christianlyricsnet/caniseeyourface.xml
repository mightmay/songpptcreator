		<segment1>Sitting in my room waiting for a train. What will bring me back to Your arms again. I've shuffled through them all and every time You won. Is there nothing new underneath the sun?</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't want to ask You for a sign. I don't need all my tears turned into wine. And even though I love You anyway</segment2>
		<segment3>Can I see Your face?. Can I see Your face?. Nothing's standing in Your place. Can I see Your face?</segment3>
		<segment4>Standing in the cold - searching the stars. Trying to figure out just where You are. Get me on my knees - shake me to the bone. Leave a message on my answer phone</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm sorry I strained my eyes to see. Some things should remain a mystery. But who put this desire in my heart?. Touch my eyes - fill my head. My brand new shoes, heavy as lead. I want to see Your face, want to touch those scars. Tell me where You've gone?!</segment5>
		<segment6>Can I see Your face?. Can I see Your face?. You the author of my faith. Can I see Your face?</segment6>
		<segment7>Can I See Your Face?</segment7>
		<segment8>Sitting in my room waiting for a train. What will bring me back to Your arms again. I've shuffled through them all and every time You won. Is there nothing new underneath the sun?</segment8>

		<segment10>Can I see Your face?. Can I see Your face?. Nothing's standing in Your place. Can I see Your face?</segment10>
		<segment11>Standing in the cold - searching the stars. Trying to figure out just where You are. Get me on my knees - shake me to the bone. Leave a message on my answer phone</segment11>
