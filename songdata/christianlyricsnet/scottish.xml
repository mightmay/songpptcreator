		<segment1>Twisting, turning, I beat my fist against my chest, Stretching, burning, I rage against the ugliness, Shake me, break me, Make me into something free, Make me complete, 'cause this is where I want to be.</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna be where he abounds, I wanna be where he abounds.</segment2>
		<segment3>Bleeding, burning, We're sharing in your death daily, We choose to learn, We set no stones for stumbling, Shake me, break me, Make me into something free, Make me complete for you.</segment3>
		<segment4>I wanna be where he abounds, I wanna be where he abounds. I wanna be where he abounds, (I wanna show you, I wanna know you, I wanna show how much I care). I wanna be where he abounds. (I wanna show you, I wanna know you, I wanna show how much I care)</segment4>
		<segment5>Searching for truth, Searching for you, Searching for truth, Searching for you.</segment5>
		<segment6>Wash me away, I wanna be where he abounds, Wash me away, I wanna be where he abounds, (I wanna show you, I wanna know you, I wanna show how much I care). I wanna be where he abounds. (I wanna show you, I wanna know you, I wanna show how much I care)</segment6>
		<segment7>So break me.    </segment7>
