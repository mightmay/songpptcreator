		<segment1>Hey taxi. Take me straight to the heart of it. The nucleus of politics where somebody started it. Cause they taxed me. With a scalpel piece by piece. They cut me deep and bled me dry until there was nothing left to bleed</segment1>
		<segment2>And this is how I choose to live. As if I'm jumping off a cliff. Knowing that you'll save me. Knowing that you'll save me. And after all the stupid things I did. There's nothing left there to forgive. Because you already forgave me. Yeah you already forgave me</segment2>
		<segment3>Just keep driving. Leave this defeat miles behind me. So far back I'd have to rack my mind just to remind me. I keep trying. To pick myself back up and then move on. And think about the life I'll have when this fragile one is gone</segment3>
		<segment4>Never forget. There's life after death and taxes. And forgiveness comes. Then all of the rest is what passes away. Death and decay can't touch us now</segment4>
		<segment5>Every breath that I inhale is followed by exhaling. Sure as the one who never fails, I know will never fail me    </segment5>
