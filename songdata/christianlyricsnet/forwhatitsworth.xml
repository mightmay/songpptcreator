		<segment1>For what its worth. Ill give all that I have. Without ever looking back Ill follow you. For what its worth. I will offer up my life. As living proof of what Your love can do. I will run and not grow weary, I will walk and not be faint. I cant sing loud enough. I could never earn Your love. Im just a glimpse of the hope You see in me. Hold my heart in Your hands. Jesus, help me understand. I can only give my life, for what its worth. For what its worth. I am standing here amazed. By the wonders that Your mighty hands have made. I dont deserve. To be covered by Your grace. So with every breath the least that I can say. I will run and not grow weary, I will walk and not be faint. I cant sing loud enough. I could never earn Your love. Im just a glimpse of the hope You see in me. Hold my heart in Your hands. Jesus, help me understand. I can only give my life, for what its worth. I will give my all to You my king. There is nothing more that you ask of me. I will lift will lift my voice, and I will sing. There is nothing more that I can give a king. I will lift my voice, I will lift my voice. I cant sing loud enough. I could never earn Your love. Im just a glimpse of the hope You see in me. Hold my heart in Your hands. Jesus, help me understand. I can only give my life, for what its worth. I can only give my life, for what its worth    </segment1>
