		<segment1>Just close your eyes. Take in the tune I send to you</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh my lullaby. Can soothe when yourfriends have moved to Neptune</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus:). It must be the way that I can hear you say this now. Don't be afraid. Just know that I'll be with you somehow. All of your cries. Soon they will drown in my lullabies. Just close your eyes. Just close your eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't be afraid. When the day has become your lion's den. It's pure concentrate. Your comforting words have marked a trend. I'm giving up. Wishing on the falling stars. I'm living up to something new. I've made a vow. It's taken me high. It's taken me far. I'll keep singing your rune. You'll hear it all around</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus x2)    </segment5>
