		<segment1>You say. With a mustard seed of faith. That I can make the mountain move. Sometimes. I am so afraid. Even though I know it's true. Because my faith feels just like doubt. I don't know what to pray right now</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh I believe. Please help my unbelief. Jesus give me grace. To trust what I can't see. Your ways are not my own. Some things I'll never know. But you say blessed are the ones who never see. They just believe</segment2>
		<segment3>So now. With a heart full of questions. I come to you just as I am. All my weakness. All my fears. All I've run from all these years. In the middle of my doubt. Some that still I'm finding out</segment3>
		<segment4>I believe. Please help my unbelief. Jesus give me grace. To trust what I can't see. Your ways are not my own. Some things I'll never know. But you say blessed are the ones who never see. They just believe</segment4>
		<segment5>When my faith feels just like doubt. I believe. Oh I believe</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh I believe. Please help my unbelief. Jesus give me grace. To trust what I can't see. Your ways are not my own. Some things I'll never know. But you say blessed are the ones who never see. They just believe. But you say blessed are the ones who never see. They just believe    </segment6>
