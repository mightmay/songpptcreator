		<segment1>You don't own me, But you wish you did. I feel that life is moving way too fast.</segment1>
		<segment2>You apologize, But I don't hear, You think its easy to make believe that I still care.</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus:</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes life brings you down, But there's no better way to make you understand, The truth will hurt, especially when your right, But mostly when your wrong.</segment4>
		<segment5>Sensitive, Thats what you are, There has to be a willingness to change on both our parts.</segment5>
		<segment6>You say you listen, But you don't hear. I'm sick and tired of trying to make my conscience clear.</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus 2x)    </segment7>
