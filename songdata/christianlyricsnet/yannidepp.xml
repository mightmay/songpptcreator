		<segment1>Blank stare. Smile, with teeth exposed. Novocain. All we are, are crocodiles. Black out. Blessed we come and blessed we go. But this world is full of white teeth and black lungs. The skin bares no scar, but it is gray. Your smile is so great, but your face is blank. Think not, don't think: suffice. The revolutionary fade..&quot;I get bored&quot;. You're drowning in ankle deep water.     </segment1>
