	<english>
		<segment1>Letting go of your hand. I walk alone again. On this path, in this pain. My flesh burned away. My body broken. Thought I was strong </segment1>
		<segment2>I see the perfect day. I won't walk away. [X2] </segment2>
		<segment3>I gave my faith to the wind today (wind today). I won't let you make the same mistake (same mistake). It seems so easy to walk away (walk away). Remember how it used to be. I'll never (never). I'll never (never). I'll never (never). I'll never. Make the same mistake </segment3>
		<segment4>And I'll never </segment4>
		<segment5>And I'll never make the same mistake. Of letting go of your hand. [X2].     </segment5>
