		<segment1>Today is not a good day. Stranded in the heartache. Watching all the world race. and pass me by</segment1>
		<segment2>Like a wave on the ocean. Comes a flood of emotion. And it cant go unspoken. No it cant go unspoken one more time</segment2>
		<segment3>We fall apart just to come alive. A broken heart can shatter all the lies. A brand new start and a goodbye. We fall apart just to come alive</segment3>
		<segment4>Yeah but this is still a good life. Standing in the sunlight. Scattering a long line. Of fear and shame. Cause underneaththe surface there's a heart and a purpose. And I swear that its just worth it. Yeah I swear that its worth it    </segment4>
