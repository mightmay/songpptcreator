		<segment1>I ask myself the question. What is wrong with me. Can't figure what it is or. Why it's never me they. Want when will my turn. Come about and when. Will justice see me why. All these stupid questions. They never help me you. Never notice me you. Never seem to see when. I'm walking by you never. Ever say hi I don't know. Nobody that I don't want. To know but I'd sure like. To know you and I'd like. To show you how the. Way I am and things that. Matter much to me how. I say I am I usually how. Those things don't seem.     </segment1>
