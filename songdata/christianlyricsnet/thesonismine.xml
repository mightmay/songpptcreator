		<segment1>Men of America, its time to stop being brainwashed. [..further lyrics for this part coming soon..]. Blind eyes and deaf ears are not welcome here. Blind eyes and deaf ears are not welcome here.</segment1>
		<segment2>Go.. In my desperation, Ill fight for your affection, to set.. to set me apart, to find.. to find who I truly am. Oh.. The Son is mine.</segment2>
		<segment3>Power corrupts definitely, conceit is a mask to insecurity. Your influence criticized by friends and enemies. I know that no matter how many bridges I burn, how many lessons I never fully learn, love is something all alone I would never.. I would never deserve. The Son Is Mine.</segment3>
		<segment4>This is my confession of my troubled soul. Renew me, and make my eyes shine. The Son is mine. (The Son is mine.) This is a conflict of two natures. In my body is both, evil and death. Who will set me free?</segment4>
		<segment5>Power corrupts definitely, conceit is a mask to insecurity. Your influence criticized by friends and enemies. The sun never sets on my life.</segment5>
		<segment6>The Son never sets, the Son is mine for life. The Son never sets, the Son is mine for life. The Son never sets, the Son is mine for life. The Son never sets, the Son is mine for life.    </segment6>
