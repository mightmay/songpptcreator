		<segment1>the day i left you was the worst mistake i ever made. was ready to become something i didn't need you dragging me down. thought your love just wasn't enough. my hair combed, nice shoes tied tight. was ready to conquer life. help unwanted i can do this on my own and then i found myself wounded. tripping over myself, falling and scraping my knee. sadness fills for i know i've failed. why did i leave scared to go back. hoping you'll take me in with open arms. but also know the hurt i've caused. the breeze of angel wings. standing there a midst of lowers of every being. tears grow and orchestra begins to play. what a beautiful day, why are you alone. run child it's time for you to go home. wounded spirit face in the dirt. i cry out for you to take me in. your heart holds me close, and. i look up to face this world which so scares me. faith in you loneliness just seems to fade. the man once inside now a child walking in your footsteps. hoping held leaves under feet from the trees of fall. listening to autumn's call. a deep breathe to continue on, fragile. depending on you Christ carry's me the rest of the walk    </segment1>
