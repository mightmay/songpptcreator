		<segment1>We walk hand in hand 'til life does us part. me and the world my scum sweetheart. We met long ago with a flirt and a stare. together ever since a lethal love affair. I tried to get out to get up and go. I was afraid of the fall the vertigo </segment1>
		<segment2>You made me suffer guilt was your game. you had control of what I became. A rotten romance if I'd stayed I'd die. t'was a fond farewell when I said goodbye. Now I'm free on solid ground. no more of you pushing me around me around </segment2>
		<segment3>You're my scum sweetheart. You're the world you broke my heart. You're my scum sweetheart. You're the world you broke my heart </segment3>
		<segment4>You're the world full of lies. how could I think of compromise?. It seems to me a solitaire affair. I was in need but you didn't care. Please stay away heartbreaker. you're not gonna be my soul taker. I've got friends that want to see you. they'd stay away if they had a clue </segment4>
		<segment5>You're my scum sweetheart. You're the world you broke my heart. You're my scum sweetheart. You're the world you broke my heart </segment5>
		<segment6>It's a black heart that I see. it's evil it'sbad and all in between. Whatever it is I'll do my part. to keep you from being their scum sweetheart </segment6>
		<segment7>You're my scum sweetheart. You're the world you broke my heart. You're my scum sweetheart. You're the world you broke my heart     </segment7>
