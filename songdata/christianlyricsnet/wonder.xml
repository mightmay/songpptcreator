		<segment1>Speak up sir and clearly state your name. Did you say you are the Son and came to save. How in my right mind should I believe. That a life exists beyond what I perceive</segment1>
		<segment2>Change all my fear to faith in you. I'm forgetting all I know and I'm leaning on your love. Yes, I see now.. All your wonder. My mind will now make room for all the truth that is in you. and I see now.. all your wonder</segment2>
		<segment3>Let me journey to the unveiled place. Where my selfish wills and ways become untraced. Suddenly my visions getting clear. When I see the answers reasons disappear.     </segment3>
