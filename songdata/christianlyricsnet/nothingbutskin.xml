		<segment1>I put on my stinking coat again. But that so much rain would come from inside. I didn't understand. I could always protect me. But I couldn't protect me from this. That all of this was just a death kiss</segment1>
		<segment2>Just one silent word and I'm whole again. You said it</segment2>
		<segment3>Look at me now. I'm hardly moving. It's only you and me now. It's only you. I scream but the walls suck my air</segment3>
		<segment4>I look at my arms resting on her back. They can't be mine they look more dead then alive. I hate that I own the ability to not get back on track. I wet her hair and they still look more dead then alive</segment4>
		<segment5>To be allowed to break into a thousand pieces. In her arms and in your hand. Can't even form my lips to say Jesus. But I thank you for knowing where I'm supposed to land</segment5>
		<segment6>People say I should eat more, boy they should see me now. I'm almost vanishing, skin so thin I can see right through. Makes you more visible inside me, you rise as I bow. Fight for every breath and breathe only you    </segment6>
