		<segment1>- verse 1 -. She sits in the back seat. Its like her face has transparency. Because we can all see exactly what shes thinking. And we all know she misses him. And we all know shes wondering. Just how things might have been. If she hadnt started noticing</segment1>
		<segment2>- chorus -. Everything else in everybody else. Thats making her forget about everything she loves. But everything else in everybody else. Could never replace everything she loves.</segment2>
		<segment3>- verse 2 -. Well she hates being lonely. But always wants to be alone. She thinks shes the only broken lover on this road. And we all know she misses him. And we all know shes wondering. Just how things might have been. If she hadnt started noticing</segment3>
		<segment4>- chorus -.     </segment4>
