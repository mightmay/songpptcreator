		<segment1>Over the mountains and the sea. Your river runs with love for me. And I will open up my heart. And let the healer set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth. And I will daily lift my hands. For I will always sing. Of when your love came down</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever. I could sing of your love forever</segment2>
		<segment3>Over the mountains and the sea. Your river runs with love for me. And I will open up my heart. And let the healer set me free. I'm happy to be in the truth. And I will daily lift my hands. For I will always sing. Of when your love came down</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). (Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, I feel like dancing. This foolishness, I know. But when the world has seen the light. They will dance with joy. Like we're dancing now</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus). (Chorus)    </segment6>
