		<segment1>Come back don't leave keep stalling. Come back to me I'm falling. In love</segment1>
		<segment2>But the last thing you said to me. Made it seem like those just won't last. Time and time again. Breaking all our plans from the past</segment2>
		<segment3>You'll find out. Hear me now. There's someone better out there</segment3>
		<segment4>You made me laugh. I mad eyou cry. It's time we said our last goodbye    </segment4>
