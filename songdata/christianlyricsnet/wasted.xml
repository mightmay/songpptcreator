		<segment1>Standing at the back door she tried to make it fast. One tear hit the hardwood, it fell like broken glass. She said sometimes love slips away. And you just can't get it back lets face it. For one split second she almost turned around. But that would be like pouring raindrops back into a cloud. So she took another step and said. I see the way out and i'm gonna take it</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting. To wake up one day and find. That i let all of these years go by wasted</segment2>
		<segment3>Another glass of whiskey, but it still don't kill the pain. He stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain. He said it's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday. Gotta face it</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: i don't wanna spend my life jaded, waiting. To wake up one day and find. That i let all of these years go by wasted. I don't wanna keep on wishing, missing. The still of the morning, the color of the night. I ain't spending no more time wasted</segment4>
		<segment5>She kept driving along til the moon and the sun. Were floating side by side. He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear. For the first time in a while,amen</segment5>
		<segment6>(Repeat chorus).     </segment6>
