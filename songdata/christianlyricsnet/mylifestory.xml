		<segment1>I was on my way. To be with you today. well you know it's true. Because I wouldn't lie to you</segment1>
		<segment2>First my car broke down. So then I had to hitch a ride. I was almost there. When the motor died</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't hate me forever. I'm better late than never. I failed you. I'm sorry. That's simply my life story</segment3>
		<segment4>I know it's much too late. To take you on a date. I know that it's no use. But this is my excuse</segment4>
		<segment5>I was in a plane. And it was falling from the sky. I knew I had to survive. So I could say goodbye</segment5>
		<segment6>You change your mind. Like I change the time. That I was gonna call you. Or say I was about to. You change your mind. Like I change the time. I said that I would be there. But then I didn't have a thing to wear    </segment6>
