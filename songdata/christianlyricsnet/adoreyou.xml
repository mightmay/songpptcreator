		<segment1>It's a mystery. That the maker of the universe. Calls me his own</segment1>
		<segment2>It amazes me. That the one who lets me wander. Always leads me home</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I. Have found me a place. In your heart. Where I. Forever will stay</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS: I adore you. Adore you. No one in this whole world. I love more</segment4>
		<segment5>I adore you. Adore you. No one in this whole world. I love more (no). No one in this whole world. I love more</segment5>
		<segment6>Deep inside of me. There's a holy sanctuary. A place full of dreams. There you speak to me. And I follow your sweet voice. To the refuge, of your peace</segment6>
		<segment7>Now I. Will not be afraid of the darkness. Cause I. Will whisper you name</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS</segment8>
		<segment9>There's a light that shines on my life. Comes straight from your heart. Down from above. These dreams that fill up my mind. They glide on your wings. They soar on your love</segment9>
		<segment10>(CHORUSx2)    </segment10>
