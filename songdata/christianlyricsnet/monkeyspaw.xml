		<segment1>i held the monkey's paw and put my wishes into play. to know the will of God, to show a motive for delay. i'm holding on to find myself. just one more wish</segment1>
		<segment2>i found a pot of gold or something shining anyway. and caught in my reflection a conviction held at bay. i crafted a cross to adorn my neck. and finally earned my due respect. and then a jewel encrusted crown. to complement my priestly gown. just big enough to weigh me down. and bring this temple to the ground. from inside out without a sound. i found a pot of gold today</segment2>
		<segment3>i held the monkey's paw today. and put my wishes into play. thanked heaven for the trophies. but i still had hell to pay. so i brought my spoils to the altar's edge. heard You say obey instead. for all of my labors and best laid plans. i'd only earned a reprimand. forevermore to understand. that dreams come true can kill a man. if never graced by sovereign hands. i held the monkey's paw.    </segment3>
