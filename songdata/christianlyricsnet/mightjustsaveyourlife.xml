		<segment1>Don't make a sound. Hold your breath. We gotta go because the Devil thinks your dead. Turn around. Face the door. Where you been sleeping isn't safe anymore. Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>I know you thought. Your faith was gone. But I'm as real as the fire that you're on. I'm not afraid. Know how to fight. And I aint leaving here alone tonight. Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. It might just save your life. Uh-huh, oh, yeah. It might just save you</segment2>
		<segment3>Just because you give up on yourself. Doesn't mean that I gave up myself, myself. Might just save your life</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't be afraid. Stand up and fight. Cause I aint leaving here alone tonight. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. It might just save your life. Uh-huh, uh-huh. It might just save your life. Uh-huh, uh-huh. It might just save your life. Uh-huh, uh-huh. It might just save your life    </segment4>
