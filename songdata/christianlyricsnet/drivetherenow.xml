		<segment1>Winter days make me say what the hey. Let's say what we needed to say. Since way back when we sailed our inhibitions. Hold on tight 'cause this is so the truth. This is so the truth</segment1>
		<segment2>I love the way that we laugh until we cry. Dance until we die. I love the smile with which you look at me and say. Get ready for this. Aaron get ready for this</segment2>
		<segment3>I hope this gets you harder. I hope you act so much stronger than I imagined. Honestly it gets you every time that I want it to. Honestly I think you're strong</segment3>
		<segment4>I love the way that we laugh until we cry. Dance until we die. I love the smile with which you look at me and say. Get ready for this. Aaron get ready for this</segment4>
		<segment5>I want you to remember me. When they tell you this is so easy. So easy    </segment5>
