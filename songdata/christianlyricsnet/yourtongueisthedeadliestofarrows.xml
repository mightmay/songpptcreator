		<segment1>Possessed by the pawn. Affect a secret smile. Challenge your poison. Your vigor is my trial. Weary when you wait. executive degree, process to restrain. The fate you have for me. </segment1>
		<segment2>You make sure what you're running to. You made sure what you're running from. Forces divine, they'll grow weak in time. </segment2>
		<segment3>The treasure we both came to find. Don't separate what falls in line. </segment3>
		<segment4>Your tongue is like a fire. Wish I could contain. With sharpened, poison words. I walk into this flame. Tinted by your ruse. Accustomed to your schemes. With wile and detriment. And still I let you be.    </segment4>
