		<segment1>Close call, that's all and now I crawl. From my hiding place. I'll hide my face while you stand by my side. While you stand by me. Did you know that what you said. never meant a thing to me. 'Cause I need something to see?. Close call, that's all and now I need you. It's all right, it's all right, and it's all right </segment1>
		<segment2>You stand by my side. So long my friend, today's your day. To be one in a million or. Just like the millions, my friend. So long, farewell, For you have chosen to save yourself. Save yourself again </segment2>
		<segment3>It's in you. Save me from myself. Speak to me, speak to me. I'm so far away. Speak to me, speak to me. Aren't you proud of me?. save yourself..you can't    </segment3>
