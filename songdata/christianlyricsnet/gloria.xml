		<segment1> wish I could crash like the waves. Or turn like the autumn leaves. In effort to praise you </segment1>
		<segment2>I wish I could smell like the forest. The fragrance lifting a mighty Chorus. In effort to praise you. In effort to praise you </segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: But I'm such a limited creature. And my words can only paint so many pictures. But somewhere I think I read that I am treasured over all creation. So I know that I must try </segment3>
		<segment4>I wish I could roll like the thunder. To leave the Earth below in wonder. In effort to praise You </segment4>
		<segment5>I wish I could fall like the summer rain. And every drop would sing Your name. In effort to praise You. In effort to praise You </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS </segment6>
		<segment7>Gloria..Glory in the highest. Forever I will hide myself in Thee. Gloria..Glory in the highest. Forever I will hide myself in Thee </segment7>
		<segment8>Every breath that I breathe. Every moment in my history. Is an effort to praise you. An effort to praise you </segment8>
		<segment9>Glory in the highest. Forever I will hide myself in Thee. Oh, Gloria. Glory in excelsis deo. Gloria, Gloria, Gloria. Gloria, Gloria, Gloria</segment9>
