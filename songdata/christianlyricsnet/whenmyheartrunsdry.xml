		<segment1>When my heart runs dry. And there's no song to sing. No holy melody. No words of love within. I recall the height from which. This fragile heart has slipped..</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: And I'll remember You. I will turn back and do. The things I used to do. for the love of You. Lord, I'll remember You. I will turn back and do. The things I used to do. for the love of You</segment2>
		<segment3>You are my soul's desire. You are the hope within. You bring my heart to life. You make my spirit sing. I recall the height from which. This fragile heart has slipped..    </segment3>
