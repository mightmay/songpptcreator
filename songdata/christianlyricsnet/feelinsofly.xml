		<segment1>You got me feeling so fly. There ain't a day that goes by. A supernatural high. Oh my goodness - people I can't deny. You got me feeling so fly</segment1>
		<segment2>Uh oh, here we go again. Talking 'bout that thing that so genuine. Uh huh, gonna make it known. So a freak like me get his cover blown. Can't help but glorify my Adonai. Gotta testify. Uh oh, here we go again. Talking 'bout His love, so genuine</segment2>
		<segment3>This ain't no fire drill. It hits like Holyfield. Break out your freak appeal. You think you know the deal. I'm gonna show you what's for real</segment3>
		<segment4>There ain't a day that goes by. That I'm not singing Your praise. There ain't a day that goes by. That I'm not lifting your name. A supernatural high. Your love is simply insane. You got me feeling so fly</segment4>
		<segment5>So fly when it's You and I. And the way we hanging in the morning time. And it's so dope I can barely cope. When you make my joy go and overflow. I can't help but glorify my Adonai. It's so fly that it's blowing minds. So fly that they can't deny</segment5>
		<segment6>There ain't a day that goes by. That I'm not singing Your praise. There ain't a day that goes by. That I'm not completely amazed. A supernatural high. Your love is simply insane. You got me feeling so fly</segment6>
		<segment7>Knock, knock. Who's there?. Well it's me, TMac. Feeling fly as a kangol hat. Insecticides can't steal this shine 'cuz. The fly I feel is straight divine.     </segment7>
