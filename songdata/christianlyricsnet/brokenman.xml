		<segment1>Thirteen, I only had a few songs to play. And big dreams to take the whole world on in a day. Oh I believe that everything that hurts has a way. To make you see in ways you'd never seen. God knows I'm a broken man. And I need him to change who I am</segment1>
		<segment2>I want to run. With all that I have. I won't let this go. You gotta know. And I want to say. Something the world can hear. Something more. You gotta know</segment2>
		<segment3>Some days its hard to feel the world over me. Stand alone believing in some things I can't see. Oh I believe that everything that hurts has a way. To make you see in ways you'd never seen. God knows I'm a broken man. And I need him to change who I am</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to run. With all that I have I won't let this go. You gotta know. I wanna say something the world can hear. Something more you gotta know. I wanna see things that I've never known. And never seen you gotta know. I want to run. With all that I have I won't let this go     </segment4>
