		<segment1>He wraps Himself in light. As with a garment, He spreads out the heavens. And walks on the wings of the wind.</segment1>
		<segment2>He sends forth the springs. from the valleys. The flow between moutains. The birds of the air dwell. by the waters, Lifting their voices in song-</segment2>
		<segment3>Singing glory, glory!. Glory to the Lamb!. All praises and honor forever.</segment3>
		<segment4>He made the moon for its season, The sun knows it setting. He looks at the Earth and it trembles, He touches the mountains. and they smoke,</segment4>
		<segment5>I will sing to the Lord all my life, I will sing praises to my God -. As long as I live, Praises to the Lord, oh my soul.</segment5>
		<segment6>Singing glory, hallelujah!. Glory to our God!. All praises and honor forever.     </segment6>
