		<segment1>Bored in a stable with nothing to do. We make a game of throwing our shoes. Lead me to water, but not to the track. Show me a saddle and I'll say, &quot;Hey get off my back.&quot;. All in favor (all in favor) say &quot;Nay!&quot;. We like the flavor of (we like the flavor of) hay. We're gonna graze all of our days. Until they take us away and turn us into glue. Like Mr. Ed always said.. May the horse be with you. May the horse be with you. May the Horse be with you everyday. I trot by the fillies (they like me of course). They all dig my band (yea I'm a rocking horse). You gotta take off your spurs to ride me you know. If you want me to stop then yell out &quot;Whoa&quot;. All in favor (all in favor) say &quot;Nay!&quot;. We like the flavor of (we like the flavor of) hay.    </segment1>
