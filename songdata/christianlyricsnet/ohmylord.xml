		<segment1>(Featuring The Fisk Jubilee Singers) </segment1>
		<segment2>I remember feeling like I was all alone. Couldn't ever give anybody else control. Heavy burdens always seemed to weigh me down. I called out, &quot;save me now&quot;. There You were to catch me when I couldn't stand. Â‘Cause I was falling, falling with no way to land. I'm amazed by Your everlasting love. Your strength lifted me up </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, my Lord, You gone and set me free. Oh, my Lord ain't nothing holding on me. Oh, my Lord it's a brand new day. Somebody raise your hands and sing, &quot;Oh, my Lord&quot; </segment3>
		<segment4>Since I met You, I have been forever changed. Let the water rise, I don't have to be afraid. You know I'll praise You every season of my life. My Jesus, I'll testify </segment4>
		<segment5>You saved me, forgave me, and now I believe. I belong to the King of kings    </segment5>
