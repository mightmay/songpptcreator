		<segment1>At times the woman deep inside me. Wanders far from home, And in my mind I live a life. That chills me to the bone. A heart, running for arms out of reach, But who is the stranger my longing seeks?. I don't know. But it scares me through and through, 'cause I've a man at home. Who needs me to be true.</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, faithless heart, Be far away from me. Playing games inside my head. That no one else can see. Oh, faithless heart, You tempt me to the core, But you can't have a hold on me, So don't come around anymore.</segment2>
		<segment3>(the feelings here, god, the feelings here.)</segment3>
		<segment4>God, you know my feelings here. Could wipe my world away, Ravaging the promises. A stronger heart once made, So hold me, I'm falling so fast, And tell me that the fighting inside will pass. As I walk away, And find the strength to choose. The man who waits for me. With a heart that's true.</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, faithless heart, (faithless heart..). Be far away from me. Playing games inside my head. That only I can see. Oh, faithless heart, (faithless heart..). You tempt me to the core, But you can't have a hold on me, So don't come around anymore.</segment5>
		<segment6>Faithless heart!</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, faithless heart, (faithless heart..). Be far away from me. Playing games inside my head. That nobody else can see. Oh, faithless heart, (faithless heart..). You tempt me to the core, But you can't have a hold on me, So don't come around anymore.</segment7>
		<segment8>Well, you can't have a hold on me. So don't come around.    </segment8>
