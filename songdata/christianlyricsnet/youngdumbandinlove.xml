		<segment1>well it was me and burkam running circles round the joint. trying to jump on the circus trying to get across our point. ya we were young and dump and looking for a fight. burning both ends of the candle at both ends of the night. she was walking gracefully like she stepped out of a cocoon. down through manhattan boulevard and first avenue. with her black frame glasses and her daisy perfume i said. have we met before? she said no its only noon </segment1>
		<segment2>uh ohÂ… to be young and dumb and in love. to be young and dumb and in love</segment2>
		<segment3>baby you got me ten feet off the ground. im talking too much and you don't make a sound. the prettiest face and those rockabye baby browns. all i've waited for's come true. to be young and dumb and in love. with you you you you</segment3>
		<segment4>well we sat in the park grass so scared of the past. rolling round like blankets oh this wont last. dancing to five spot records with smoke in the air. you could smell it the morning your could smell it in her hair. found myself on my knees a little more each night. is this what i've waited for for all of my life. put your hand with a feather tattoo on your wrist. on this skinny little white boys fat hustling hips </segment4>
		<segment5>uh oh to be young and dumb and in love. to be young and dumb and love</segment5>
		<segment6>baby you got me ten feet off the ground. i'm talking too much and you don't make a sound. the prettiest face and those rockabye baby browns. all i've waited for's come true. to be young and dumb and in love. with you you you you</segment6>
		<segment7>she's not like any other girl. she's got me crying first, dying first, waiting for the repo man</segment7>
		<segment8>well under the weeping willows and a sea firing flies. with your gypsy necklace and my big brown bow tie. you kissed my lips like i was catching a flight. i said if i'm honest i fell for you that first night. if i'm honest i fell for you that first night. that first night oh oh oh </segment8>
		<segment9>to be young and dumb and in love. to be young and dumb and in love. to be young and dumb and in love. to be young and dumb and in love. with you you you    </segment9>
