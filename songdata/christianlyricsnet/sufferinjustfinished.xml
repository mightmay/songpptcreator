		<segment1>Haman, oh, he was the one, you know. Haman, who wouldn't let us alone -- I got to. Say man, that guy would spit in my face. That fellow was sick; he could've wiped out our race. Haman, was cruel and insane. Haman, he was kind of vain. Haman, conceived a terrible plan. But Esther was the queen and then she avenged it. So hang it on Haman cause his plan was surely wicked. I'm glad our sufferin' just finished. That mean, grumpy man was an ancient kind of bigot. But now our sufferin' just finished. 혩Cause genocide is not right. Haman, oh when he saw Mordecai, he say. Hey, man, I can't wait till he dies, okay. Haman said &quot;Jews, they won't last here&quot;. He thought that Jews were scum, but Esther's one, so he's done. Ah, So hang it on Haman cause his plan was surely wicked. I'm glad our sufferin' just finished. The queen took a stand. 혩Cause this ain't no time for chickens. I'm glad she's lovely and pretty and Mordecai is all right. Oh Esther!. So hang it on Haman cause his plan was surely wicked. I'm glad our sufferin' just finished. That mean, grumpy man was an ancient kind of bigot. I'm glad our sufferin' just finished. Yeah the king caught Haman and his end was sorta sickenin'. He had to punish him quickly. Yeah, the queen took a stand. 혩Cause this ain't no time for chickens. I'm glad she's lovely and pretty. 혩cause genocide -- oh is not right. Our sufferin' just finished, our sufferin' just finished. Don't forget! Ahhh, Wham bam hang Haman!. Our sufferin' just finished, our sufferin' just finished. Don't forget!    </segment1>
