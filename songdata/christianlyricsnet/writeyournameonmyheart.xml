		<segment1>God above. In You I live and breathe. And You will always be. Son of God. I owe my life to You. Your promises are true. Your love goes on  and on forever</segment1>
		<segment2>So write Your name upon my heart. Burn Your word into my mind. Make a temple of this body. Let Your Spirit move inside. I have wandered through the valley. And I have wondered who I am. So live in me, make Your mark. And  write Your name upon my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>God above. The first, the last, the same. All glory to Your name. My Jesus. It's You who I adore. Lamb of God and Savior. Your love goes on and on forever</segment3>
		<segment4>Imprint  on every part of me. The image of  the Son. And complete in me the work. You have  begun    </segment4>
