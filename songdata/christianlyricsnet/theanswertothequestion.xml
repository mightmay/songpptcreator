		<segment1>I'm growing tired of a mouth shut tight. when all I want to do is tell the whole world. about the Man sitting at the right. hand of the One in Heaven. how could I sing about anything but Him</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: He is the answer to the question. He is the cure for the infection. He is all He says He is. He is the ultimate reflection. of holiness and true perfection. He is all He says He is</segment2>
		<segment3>How can I not cry watching as the. world dies without a prayer. They look to their own construction. bound to the living God of Earth and Heaven. How could they sing about everything but Him, yeah, yeah</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm so tired of a mouth shut tight. All I want to do is tell the whole world. about the man sitting at the right. hand of the One in Heaven. How could I sing about anything but Him</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
