		<segment1>Dont just, don't sit down. Im wanting this to be a super natural flood of life. And not just make-believe. Singing about what's real to me, gasping for air, Trying to breathe while being put down by me</segment1>
		<segment2>While thinking oh so hard to just stay alive. Treading over time while Im slowly dying. I take one last breath and one last prayer. To survive the waves, they break me. The air hits my face; my unthinking prayer. This new found grace I swallowed the air. Quick to erase; it's such a beautiful day</segment2>
		<segment3>I was so alone; I was to myself. Thought I was on my way, but I was missing you. So make it up, break it up. Take this wherever you want. And I wanna go. So just stay this way on this train. Which I roll</segment3>
		<segment4>I was so alone; I was to myself. Thought I was on my way, but I was missing you. So make it up, break it up. Take this wherever you want. And I wanna go    </segment4>
