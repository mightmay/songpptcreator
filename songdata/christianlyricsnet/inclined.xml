		<segment1>(verse 1). Seek me in the morning. Do you have to go out in the world?. You say that you just don't want me. Have I been so cruel that you can't see?</segment1>
		<segment2>(pre-chorus 1). You took so much time to state your case. With words that slap me in the face. Look in the eyes of love's embrace--and you'll find me</segment2>
		<segment3>(verse 2). How much do I love you. You could never begin to know the truth. Blood stains on my hands, but. Don't you know I chose to die for you</segment3>
		<segment4>(pre-chorus 2). So what's your reason to refrain?. You know I'd do it all again. Too much has happen to pretend--you don't see me</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus). Cause I'm feeling so inclined. To give you peace of mind. But you don't even have the time--to call.     </segment5>
