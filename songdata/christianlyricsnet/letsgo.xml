		<segment1>You gotta nice job in an office on the seventh floor. Oh but you're looking out the window. And you're thinking that there's something more. You clear you head. You close your eyes. But something deep inside you cries</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Let's go, let's go tho the great unknown. Find the one that rolled away the stone. Let's go to the foreign shore. Find a way to give like we never gave before. Let's go, going far and wide. Pack your bag and leave it all behind. What are we waiting for. Let's go</segment2>
		<segment3>Back home through the middle of the parking lot. You give away the car. Give away the money that you've got. Neighbors will talk. And oh they should. Saying something ain't right in the neighorhood</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)    </segment4>
