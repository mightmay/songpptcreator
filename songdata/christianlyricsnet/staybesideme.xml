		<segment1>When my broken world caves in. And the darkness covers over. With a love, love, love that heals </segment1>
		<segment2>You come, You make us one. So, Jesus, stay with my heart, stay beside me. You are hope for my soul, You complete me. You make us one. You make us one. When Your tenderness surrounds. And Your gentle whisper finds me. With a love, love, love that fills. You come, You make us one. When the beautiful unfolds. And my longing touches heaven. With a love, love, love that fills. You come, You make us one. You are love, You are grace. You are kindness and compassion. You are love, You are grace. You are God     </segment2>
