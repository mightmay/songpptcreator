		<segment1>We go back and forth. Just looking for a life line. Nothing more than hours. Just waiting for a phone call</segment1>
		<segment2>These are the nights. When nothing's gonna break me more. Just please come soon. This afternoon</segment2>
		<segment3>All we want. Is our own to be here. For a life time. But you can't expect the whole world</segment3>
		<segment4>These are the nights. When nothing's gonna break me more. Jesus please come soon. This afternoon</segment4>
		<segment5>These are the nights.    </segment5>
