		<segment1>I try too hard. Persuasion never wins. So let me start again</segment1>
		<segment2>And here it is. As plain as day. These words not mine but His. And this is what they say</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: My hands they made you. My breath I gave you. My son he saves you. If you want to, you can wear My name. My love unending. My truth unbending. I want you to wear My name</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm just like you. Our sin, a cross, His son. As your friends we come</segment4>
		<segment5>So here we are. Another verse, a different view. God as a Father. Us, His pursuit</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Unending. Unbending. I want you</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus 2x)</segment8>
		<segment9>One thing's for certain. I want you to wear my name. Wear my name..    </segment9>
