		<segment1>She sat a table away. Staring into space. In her own little world. And I saw a tear in her eye. Like a window to the mind. Of a frightened little girl. She never said a word. But I know I clearly heard. A cry for help. And I wanted to answer. I wanted to tell her</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: My heart goes out to you. You don't even know me. You don't even know. Oh my heart goes out to you. And I don't know what else to do. To reach you now. My heart goes out</segment2>
		<segment3>But I'm still glued to my chair. She's unaware. There's little time. And though my intentions are good. If I'm misunderstood. The price could be high. I can't fix whatever's wrong. But if I fail to pass along. Someone cares. The price could be greater. This can't wait til later</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE: For God has loved the world so much. He send His only Son. From Heaven to earth. Well there's a distance love covered. She's just a table over. All she needs is a shoulder</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS: My heart goes out to you. You don't even know me. You don't even know. Oh, my heart goes out</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord, help me do what I can do. To reach her, to reach her</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh my heart goes out to you. You don't even know me. You don't even know. Oh, my heart goes out to you</segment7>
		<segment8>Let me do what I can do to reach you now. My heart goes out. Yeah    </segment8>
