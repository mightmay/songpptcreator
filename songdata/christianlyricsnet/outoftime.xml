		<segment1>I hear them chanting again. I hear them crying out loud. I see the masses fall away. This bitter war has begun. I hear the children cry for food. Their fathers have left them all for dead</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: And we're running out of time. We're running out of time. Getting closer to the edge. We're running out of time</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a fountain filled with blood. Poured from the virus of unborn children. The masacre is endless. And we watch them fade away</segment3>
		<segment4>I hear the screaming save the trees. But we'd kill a generation to suit our own needs. What are we ending up to be. A nation in bondage that thinks we are free    </segment4>
