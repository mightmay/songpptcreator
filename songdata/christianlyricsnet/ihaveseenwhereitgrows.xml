		<segment1>A shell for the earth, all seasons reverse. A life inside out in a jet-black hearse. The feel of pain and the taste of dirt. A dardened sky and the loss of worth. Lower me down under glorious green. Eternity waits on a broken machine. Exit the soul in a vibrant white. Leaving the shell in the dead of night. Life is a path, Death a destination. I've met the end of being, my eyes are open wide. I feel myself depleting, and watch my body die. A step to the throne, i stand alone. A vacant mind and a destined home. Engaging the end in a seamless gaze. Like blind i climb through the tortured blaze. Raise me up into white unstained eternity gained, only life remains. Forever the scars have been washed away. Like blood on the brow of a forgotten day. Life is a path, Death a destination. Ive met the end of being, my eyes are open wide. I feel myself depleting, and watch my body die. Life is a path, Death a destination    </segment1>
