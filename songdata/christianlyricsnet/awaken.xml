		<segment1>Sometimes I feel like I'm just existing. I'm not really living. I'm only watching the time slip away. I've forgotten who I am in you. I'm not who I'm meant to be. I'm drifting farther away from my destiny. [Chorus:]. Awaken my heart, awaken my soul. Awaken your power and take control. Awaken the passion to live for you, lord. Awaken me. My soul is longing, my heart is searching. I'm desperate for you to move. Give me a hunger, pull me closer. I'm crying out to you. Awaken my heart, awaken my soul. Awaken your power and take control. Awaken the passion to live for you, lord. Open my eyes so I can see your presence. Dwelling inside. Wake me up, cause I can't live another minute. if I'm not shining your light. Awaken my heart, awaken my soul. Awaken the passion in me. Lord, awaken me to live my destiny. Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me. Lord, awaken me to live my destiny. Lord, awaken me and shine your light through me    </segment1>
