		<segment1>To learn from past mistakes, to crawl out of the hole I dug myself. I should have learned by now, I can't do it. And the time it flies right past me now. I pray that you would show me how. You're the only one, you're my father, I'm your son. And with your love, I'm sure it won't be long. All I ever wanted was to feel as though you cared, but as time has shown I see we're all too scared. Faith in human beings never got me anywhere. And here I stand with you. Love is what you showed me. The only time I ever felt love is when you were standing next to me.    </segment1>
