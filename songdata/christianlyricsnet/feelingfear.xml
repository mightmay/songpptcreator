		<segment1>As I move from this place. There's nowhere to hide from the pain of your face. And I don't know where to run. I am looking to hide here under the sun</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). How can it be that Your love can shine for me. Can't you see that all I feel is fear. How could it be that your love could flow from me. Can't you see that all I feel is fear again</segment2>
		<segment3>As I move from this place. There's nowhere to hide from the pain of your face. And I don't know where to run. I am looking to hide here under the sun</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). How can it be that Your love can shine for me. Can't you see that all I feel is fear. How could it be that your love could flow from me. Can't you see that all I feel is fear again</segment4>
		<segment5>And I know that I can't forget, but with your strength, I'll forgive..</segment5>
		<segment6>Now I'm back at this place. There's nowhere to hide as I look at Your face. And I know that I can't run. But I know I can hide here under the sun</segment6>
		<segment7>(chorus).     </segment7>
