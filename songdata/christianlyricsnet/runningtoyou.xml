		<segment1>Somebody told me about a place. Oh I can see it. But I've got to change my ways. Day after day its the same old thing. I keep repeating, the reason I stay this way</segment1>
		<segment2>I know what I have to do. Get back to what I know is true</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: When everything is broken, Theres a door wide open. Youll find me running through. More than just emotion. My broken heart has chosen, Jesus Im running to You. Im running to You</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm running, running to you. I'm running, running to you</segment4>
		<segment5>I can see the tear on your face. You feel defeated. Wondering what are you living for. Selfish dreams left you time and time. Empty-handed. Theres got to be something more. You know what you have to do. Get back to Who you know is true. (Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>You're the only one. Who can fix what I've become. Oh God, I believe in your love</segment6>
		<segment7>When everything is broken, Theres a door wide open. Youll find me running to You. More than just emotion. My broken heart has chosen, Jesus Im running to You    </segment7>
