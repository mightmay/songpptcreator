		<segment1>Sin always surrounds me. And I am fighting to be clean. And free indeed. Sin has no hold on me. Because my Savior set me free. Now Iﾂ知 free indeed </segment1>
		<segment2>We want to sing this song to you. We want to praise your holy name. We never want to see you go. But for you to invade our souls. We want to see you lifted high. We want to kneel before the throne. We never wanted to disgrace. But now Iﾂ知 happy you took our place </segment2>
		<segment3>Struggles never seem to go. But still I try to stay on the road. And look ahead. Then as I see your face. All my struggles fall on the road. Then I feel your embrace </segment3>
		<segment4>We want to sing this song to you. We want to praise your holy name. We never want to see you go. But for you to invade our souls. We want to see you lifted high. We want to kneel before the throne. We never wanted to disgrace. But now Iﾂ知 happy you took our place </segment4>
		<segment5>We want to sing this song to you. We want to praise your holy name. We never want to see you go. But for you to invade our souls. We want to see you lifted high. We want to kneel before the throne. We never wanted to disgrace. But now Iﾂ知 happy you took our place     </segment5>
