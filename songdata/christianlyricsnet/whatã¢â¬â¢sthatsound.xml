		<segment1>When I was out, By myself I was alone, Always talking on the phone, No-ones listening baby.</segment1>
		<segment2>As for love, I tried it once, it broke my heart. Maybe I was too young, Its too much effort baby.</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey, what's that sound, What's that sound. Something is rumbling in my soul, Making its way to my back door. Dragging me to my feet for one more time.</segment3>
		<segment4>I can ignore, Someone knocking down my door. I just sit here on the floor'. Its too much effort baby.</segment4>
		<segment5>Hey, what's that sound, What's that sound. Something is rumbling in my soul, Making its way to my back door. Dragging me to my feet for one more time.</segment5>
		<segment6>What's that sound    </segment6>
