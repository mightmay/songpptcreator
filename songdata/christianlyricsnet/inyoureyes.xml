		<segment1>Sweet Illusion knows my name. Take a breath and run away. Never ending to pretending. To escape the pain</segment1>
		<segment2>Honesty please come to me. Humbly I've found my knees. I am blind but I want to see. Come now truth and find me</segment2>
		<segment3>In your eyes. I see for the very first time. In this light. I feel and I know I'm alive</segment3>
		<segment4>No need to entertain the game. On the streets of empty fame. No sufficing too enticing. No one left to blame</segment4>
		<segment5>But honesty has come to me. Freedom found down on my knees. I was blind but now I can see. Truth has finally come to me</segment5>
		<segment6>In your eyes. I see for the very first time. In the light. I feel and I know I'm alive</segment6>
		<segment7>I'll wake up any moment now. It's so hard to believe that the traitor is me. Love is breaking through the night somehow. Not as real as it seems, here inside of this dream </segment7>
		<segment8>In your eyes. I see for the very first time. In the light. I feell and I know I'm alive </segment8>
		<segment9>And in your eyes. I see for the very first time. In the light. I feell and I know I'm alive</segment9>
		<segment10>    </segment10>
