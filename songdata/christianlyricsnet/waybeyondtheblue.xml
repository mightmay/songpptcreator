		<segment1>Way beyond the blue, the Father is calling. Let Him take you to a life beyond compare</segment1>
		<segment2>The passion fades and your sense of adventure. Sits collecting dust on a shelf. The new gets old, and hearts get cold. Where's the flame that burned with excitement. Where's the hope you once knew so well. It's lost at sea with all your dreams. There you stand caught between an endless sky above and earth below. Look above and beyond what you see to find a view of all that this life can be</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Way beyond the blue, where the Father is calling. Let Him take you to a life beyond compare. His love is wider than the skies above you. And He has plans for you, that go way beyond the blue</segment3>
		<segment4>Like the wind carries an eagle. Let His hand carry you now. And show you scenes of His mighty strength. As you rise high above all the riches that this world could give. You will find the depth of His love. And His graces that is lifting you up to live</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. God has raised us up with Christ. And seated us with Him in heavenly places. So that He can show the riches of His grace. To the coming ages </segment6>
