		<segment1>Nothing can separate. Even if I run away. Your love never fails. I know I still make mistakes. You have new mercy for me everyday. Cause Your love never fails</segment1>
		<segment2>You stay the same through the ages. Your love never changes. There may be pain in the night. But joy comes in the morning. And when the oceans rage. I don't have to be afraid. Because I know that You love me. Your love never fails</segment2>
		<segment3>The wind is strong and the water's deep. But I'm not alone here in these open seas. Cause Your love never fails. The chasm is far too wide. I never thought I'd reach the other side. But Your love never fails</segment3>
		<segment4>You make all things work together for my good. You make all things work together for my good    </segment4>
