		<segment1>Find myself on this rock place again. trying to climb hoping to find you there. at the end of my fate and my fear. fears of falling away. as im calling your name into the air. as i climb higher my body's on fire. and weak i need escape from the torturous heat. i feel my hand slipping. the loose stones come slipping away. telling me that i cant stay. It all falls empty. everything i do. yes it all falls empty. im reaching out to you. im reaching out to you. i find my self on my face again. trying to climb hoping to find you there. at the end of my fate and my fear. fears of falling away. as im calling your name into the air. this time im trying to find hoping to find you there. well im desperate and tired. of walking this wire so weak. its one thing from him thats out to break. well it does and i fee fall. cant stop this at all. i tumble and fall into your hands. It all falls empty. everything i do. yes it all falls empty. im reaching out to you. im reaching out to you. . to you. cause its easier said then done. to completely loose control. and its easier said then done. to let you pry my fingers from these arms. It all falls empty. everything i do. yes it all falls empty. im reaching out for you. im reaching out for you. im reaching out crying out for you. im reaching out for you.     </segment1>
