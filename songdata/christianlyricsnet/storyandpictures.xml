		<segment1>shook out my salvation. in all four corners of my room. lowly is the dust. trustworthy the broom</segment1>
		<segment2>white lady. growlin on a chain. peacock caw the sound of my lover's name. the tone was pure and played on gut. from your birdhouse aflame</segment2>
		<segment3>your fire burns for me. red as grace. the blush came easily to your face. your fire burns for me. red as grace. and she says that none would have her</segment3>
		<segment4>as a boy I too drew near. to the love of dust. toughskin blue light cowboy. idle hands they rust</segment4>
		<segment5>your fire burns for me. red as grace. the blush came easily to your face. your fire burns for me. red as grace. and she says that none would have her</segment5>
		<segment6>let us allow the character to build. wise as serpents and harmless as doves. let's allow the emptiness to fill. rich mercy and brotherly love</segment6>
		<segment7>your fire burns for me. red as grace. the blush came easily to your face. your fire burns for me. red as grace. and she says that none would have her    </segment7>
