		<segment1>Looking at the world. I see a need for peace. I want to change the course of history. I see the heavy souls. Praying for relief. A song for the broken we will sing</segment1>
		<segment2>Oooo. There's a light shining brighter than the sun. There's a love that can't be broken. Heaven is coming down, coming down</segment2>
		<segment3>I move within in your veins. An apathetic face. Try to recreate a beautiful escape. Our silence is weak. An epidemic on repeat. Love holds the cure for all humanity</segment3>
		<segment4>Oooo. There's a light shining brighter than the sun. There's a love that can't be broken. A savior giving hope to the world. Heaven is coming down, coming down</segment4>
		<segment5>Blessed are the weak. When we're down on our knees. Heaven is singing, heaven is singing. Blessed are the weak. When we're down on our knees. Heaven is singing, heaven is singing. A song for the broken</segment5>
		<segment6>Oooo .. yeah. There's a light shining brighter than the sun. There's a love that can't be broken. A savior giving hope to the world. Heaven is coming down, coming down. Ohhh. Ohhh    </segment6>
