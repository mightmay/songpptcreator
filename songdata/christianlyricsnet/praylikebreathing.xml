		<segment1>Pray for the kingdom come. For his will be done. Even when you dont feel a thing. Seek, seek the throne of grace. Time to see and taste. The sweetness of the king of peace</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Pray like breathing. When youre sleeping. Pray for meaning (without ceasing). When you work. In everything pray like breathing. In everything pray like breathing</segment2>
		<segment3>Pray like breathing. Pray when your feeling fine. When you feel like your losing your mind. Either way turn to him and pray. Pray every moment of the day. Live in this new way. Speak the truth and tell him what you think and feel    </segment3>
