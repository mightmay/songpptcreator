		<segment1>Who are you sent from heaven just for me?. That may not be, but that's how it seems. Why have you come into my life?. You've taken my heart. How do you make me cry?. You say you don't believe in luck and I do agree with you. Sometimes I really have to wonder. I sure feel lucky when I'm next to you. I'll never understand what you see in me. I'm just a normal guy, plain as can be. I really love to see you smile. You've turned me upside down and I don't even mind. You say you don't believe in luck and I do agree with you. Sometimes I really have to wonder. I sure feel lucky when I'm next to you.</segment1>
