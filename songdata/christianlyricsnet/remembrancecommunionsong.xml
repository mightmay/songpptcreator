		<segment1>Oh, how could it be. That my God would welcome me. Into this mystery?. Say, &quot;take this bread, take this wine&quot;. Now the simple made divine. For any to receive</segment1>
		<segment2>By Your mercy we come to Your table. By Your grace You are making us faithful</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, we remember You. And remembrance leads us to worship. And as we worship You. Our worship leads to communion. We respond to Your invitation. We remember You</segment3>
		<segment4>See His body, His blood. Know that He has overcome. Every trial that we face. None too lost to be saved. None to broken or ashamed. All are welcome in this place</segment4>
		<segment5>Dying, You destroyed our death. Rising, You restored our life. Lord Jesus, come in glory. Lord Jesus, come in glory     </segment5>
