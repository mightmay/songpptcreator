		<segment1>I wonder when we first bought into this. So satisfied with status quo. Have we convinced ourselves that this is all there is</segment1>
		<segment2>Well all that is within me. Says we were meant to break free</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Live like thereÂ’s no tomorrow. Love extravagantly. Lead a life to be followed. Goodbye Ordinary. Goodbye Ordinary</segment3>
		<segment4>We were never meant to compromise. Settle for mediocrity. This life was never made to be a waste of time</segment4>
		<segment5>Well all that is within me. Says no more just existing</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge. No more complacency. No more just settling. This time. Goodbye to atrophy. For we were meant to be. Alive</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus    </segment8>
