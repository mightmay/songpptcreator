		<segment1>When I first spoke Your name. I used it like a blade. Cutting sharp a mask to hide the pain. When I first spoke Your name</segment1>
		<segment2>When I next spoke Your name. I could no longer bear the weight. Of years hiding behind the ache. When I next spoke Your name</segment2>
		<segment3>But when You spoke my name. Oh I swear the angels sang. Peace came and stole my shame. When You spoke my name</segment3>
		<segment4>Now when I speak Your name. I sing it like a sweet refrain. I have found a peace I can't explain. When I speak Your name</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause when You spoke my name. Oh I swear the angels sang. Peace came and stole my shame. When You spoke my name</segment5>
		<segment6>I can hardly speak. Knowing You know me. Thank God I'm free</segment6>
		<segment7>Now my world has completely come undone. For I can hear the Son. Calling out to me</segment7>
		<segment8>Cause when You spoke my name. Oh I swear the angels sang. Peace came and stole my shame</segment8>
		<segment9>When You spoke my name. Oh I swear the angels sang. Peace came and stole my shame. When You spoke my name    </segment9>
