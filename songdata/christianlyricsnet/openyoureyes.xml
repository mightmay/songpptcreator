		<segment1>I see you hanging there. Blood stained and freedom. In Your hands. I see Your amazing grace. I meet compassion on Your face</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Now that I see You. I know Your love commands my soul. Now that I know You, I see. There's no one else for me. There's no one else for me</segment2>
		<segment3>I see You're standing here. It's God hands of hope. As then revealed. I see it soothe my place. What was meant has been erased</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus Twice</segment4>
		<segment5>Open your eyes. Look to the skies. The king of love. The king of heaven. Tell everyone. Your daughters and sons. The king of love. The king of heaven</segment5>
		<segment6>For the wounded. For the afflicted. Open your eyes and see the cross. For the broken-hearted. Your Father lives. Open your eyes and see the cross. Open your eyes</segment6>
		<segment7>Now that I see You, I know. Your love commands my soul. Now that I know You, I see. There's no one else for me. There's no one else for me    </segment7>
