		<segment1>There's a man on my street. He reminds me everyday. Better take what you can get. Cause there's nothing more than this. Daylight fades into the ground, Oh Lord i need you now </segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Cover me with the red sky tonight. The promise of a better day to come. Sing over me an angelic symphony. Tell me everything will be alright </segment2>
		<segment3>With the red sky tonight </segment3>
		<segment4>We're so taking with our fear. Now we're folded up in shame. With our feet nailed to the floor. We're the only ones to blame. I can't help but wonder why. Nobody bats an eye. You can see it in the faces. Of all the passers by </segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus) </segment5>
		<segment6>I sail into the sun. When the day is done. I need you in the night. So wake me in the dark. I see you in the sun. When the day is done </segment6>
		<segment7>Cover me with the red sky tonight. I promise a better day will come. Sing over me an angelic symphony. Tell me everything will be alright. Tell me everything will be alright. Tell me everything will be alright </segment7>
		<segment8>It's the red sky. It's the red sky. Tonight.     </segment8>
