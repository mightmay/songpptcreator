		<segment1>Oh come sit down An give me your word. That I'll be a man someday an I'll hurt. These troubles around me. This boy that I am. It's up here for thinkin'. And down there for dancin'. Not the other way around </segment1>
		<segment2>Apples in the summertime. Peaches in the fall. I can't keep the girl I got. I can't keep none at all </segment2>
		<segment3>Nobody knows how I can swing that sway. How I can creep from the narrow. To the broader way. But I'll do no more talkin'. I'm goin' to town. With my true love's breath upon my neck. And my hands on velvet ground </segment3>
		<segment4>Apples in the summertime. Peaches in the fall. I can't keep the girl I got. I can't keep none at all </segment4>
		<segment5>Apples in the summertime. Peaches in the fall. I can't keep the girl I got. I can't keep none at all    </segment5>
