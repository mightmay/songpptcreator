		<segment1>it's the end of the morning. what have i done?. it's finally getting warmer. oh God what have i done?. prayers for your soul while hoping mine. would leave this awful place sometime. somewhere better with no more pain. you won't love him you'll love me again. i was the one the one who was always here. fate seeks my soul and it's drawing near. i'd die today if you could forgive me, dear. i said that anything mattered.. words. i'd sing you a song i'd love you if i knew how. it's too late to hold or kiss you now. He wont remember were made perfect somehow. &quot;this morning is different&quot; .. words. i look down she's asleep in a place she can smile again. the world will forget her as she disappears to them. i swore i'd love her i'd rather pretend. &quot;all these tears are for you&quot; .. words. with poison within me and everything still. i know now what i have to do (what i never will). i will lift up my eyes to the hills. promises, promises, promises .. words.     </segment1>
