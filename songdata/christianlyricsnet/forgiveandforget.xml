		<segment1>It was a cold October day. I wish it didn't have to be this way. You told me that you'd be home soon. You never came back. What was I supposed to do. Hey Pop if you hear this song. I did what you told me. And always stayed strong. But I admit I can't keep this up. I try not to be, try not to be. Down on my luck</segment1>
		<segment2>What's done is done and let's move on. Forgive and forget is what I've been taught. I still love you with all of my heart. I'm not a genius and I'm not all that smart. But one thing I know and it's crystal clear. Is I love you Dad and I want you here. The times change and so do we. I still hope that you remember me</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna cry. Sometimes I feel like I am all tore up inside. I did what I could and do what I can. I still want to be your &quot;little man&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm not as afraid of the claw anymore. If you come back dad I'll sleep on the floor. You're still my best friend I ever had. Forget the past just be my dad    </segment4>
