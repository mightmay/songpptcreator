		<segment1>What a shame we all became such fragile, broken things. A memory remains just a tiny spark. I give it all my oxygen, To let the flames begin. To let the flames begin.</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, glory. Oh, glory. This is how we'll dance when, When they try to take us down. This is what will be oh glory.</segment2>
		<segment3>Somewhere weakness is our strength, And I'll die searching for it. I can't let myself regret such selfishness. My pain and all the trouble caused, No matter how long.

		<segment5>Reaching as I sink down into light. Reaching as I sink down into light.</segment5>
		<segment6>This is how we dance when, When they try to take us down. This is how we'll sing it. This is how we'll stand when, When they burn our houses down. This is what will be oh glory.    </segment6>
