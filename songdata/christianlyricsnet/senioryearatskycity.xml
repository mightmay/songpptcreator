		<segment1>Stuck in this white world. Walls caving in. Walls caving in. The tides will turn. Oh.. The tides will turn. I promise you. The tides will turn. I promise you.</segment1>
		<segment2>I will be there for you. I will be there for you. Ill see this through. I will be there for you. I will be there for you. Ill see this through. Ill be there. Ill be there.</segment2>
		<segment3>Youre on my turf now. Youre on my turf now. Cause youre on my turf now. Searching, swiftly, all your life, you cant hide. Searching, swiftly, Im there for you, Im here for you. Take my hand, well make it through. Searching, swiftly, all your life, you cant hide.</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, no, I wont let you down. Can you hear the glory of the trumpets.    </segment4>
