		<segment1>From the deep I cry. I am needing change in my life. I have let the cold creep in and lock my ability to feel (deeply). Just now a shaft of light shot through my soul. Opening up the windows and the doors. Reaching to the corners and my flaws. Showing my need</segment1>
		<segment2>Im running out of time to live. Running out of love to give. Running out of life within. God help me</segment2>
		<segment3>I dont care who stares. Never want to be what I have been again. Grace has taken over and drawn me in and I am embracing it. Cause now I see Your light drawing me close. Overwhelming love I dont deserve. But Ill take the hope You bring, You hold it out to me. Without You</segment3>
