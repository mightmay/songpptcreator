		<segment1>you're bored, gotta wonder if there's more. waiting for the dreamlife you thought you had in store. trying to feel something you can chase a life thats thriller. living on the edge drinking, smoking dream killers. coulda been shoulda been woulda been, what might your life have been. today you're not a has been. but at your life's end. will you have regrets then, have regrets then?. are you ok with today if tomorrow is the end. live today through the future's lens. don't wanna wish you could rewind and play it again </segment1>
		<segment2>[chorus]. stand up write the soundtrack for your life. it doesn't happen to you you happen to life. stand up, you know you're gonna have to fight. don't wanna lose the will to find your light. stand up, God gave you the gift of life. it doesn't happen to you, you happen to life. stand up, do something with your light. you're a light on a hill, you're meant to shine so bright. so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright </segment2>
		<segment3>we're all scared, gotta wonder what's out there. shooting down the ones who did what we wish we dared. everybody's scared to karaoke in the open. afraid we're not as special as what we might be hoping. so we're frozen, haven't chosen. just going through the motions. faith and belief, courage overrule emotions. stand up and be counted for something when it's time. decide where you stand, take your hands raise em high. live today through the future's lens. don't wanna wish you could reset and play it again. [chorus]     </segment3>
