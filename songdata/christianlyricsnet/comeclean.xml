		<segment1>How did I get here standing in a mess that I have made?. Little by little adding to the chaos everyday. I know it's time, it's time to come clean. I know it's time, it's time to come clean</segment1>
		<segment2>Boxes full of things I've shuffled and shifted place to place. All the years of me, everything I want to keep and throw away. I know it's time, it's time to come clean. I know it's time, it's time to come clean</segment2>
		<segment3>I empty out the pieces. And I put them where they go</segment3>
		<segment4>But where do they go?. Where do they go?. Does anything in me know?. Where do they go?</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm finding what I've covered and holding it up to the morning light. I'm opening my life a little at a time and it's all right. 'Cause it takes time, it takes time to come clean. Yeah, and I know it's time, it's time to come clean</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm picking up the pieces. And I put them where they go</segment6>
		<segment7>But where do they go?. Where do they go?. Does anything in me know?. Where do they go?. Where do they go?</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm picking up the pieces</segment8>
		<segment9>So where do they go?. Where do they go?. I wanna know just where do they go?. Where do they go</segment9>
		<segment10>Because I need to know. Just where do they go? Where do they go?. I've got to know just where do they go?. Where do they go? Will I ever know?    </segment10>
