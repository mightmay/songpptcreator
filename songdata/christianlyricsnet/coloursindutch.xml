		<segment1>Life as a movement, still. Like a single leaf that finally fell. Fear of more moments lost. All the years failings will never be stopped</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, such colours in Dutch. So much colour in Dutch</segment2>
		<segment3>Time caught in photographs. I remember when futures were planned. Stared at with vacant eyes. All the white coats prescribe you a life     </segment3>
