		<segment1>I got rice cooking in the microwave. Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave. And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say. Hey I'm doing alright </segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup. Feelin pretty good and that's the truth. It's neither drink nor drug induced. No I'm just doin alright</segment2>
		<segment3>And it's a great day to be alive. I know the sun's still shinin when I close my eyes. There's some hard times in the neigborhood. But why can't every day be just this good?</segment3>
		<segment4>It's been fifteen years since I left home. Said good luck to every seed I'd sown. Give it my best and then I left it alone. Oh..I hope their doin alright</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I look in the mirror and what do I see?. A lone wolf there starin back at me. Long in the tooth but harmless as can be. Lord I guess he's doin alright</segment5>
		<segment6>And it's a great day to be alive. I know the sun's still shinin when I close my eyes. There's some hard times in the neigborhood. But why can't every day be just this good?</segment6>
		<segment7>Sometimes it's lonely. Sometimes it's only me. And the shadows that fill this room. Sometimes I'm fallin. Desperately callin. Howlin at the moon.. Ahwoo!. Ahwoo!</segment7>
		<segment8>Well I might go get me a new tattoo. Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise. Might even grow me a Fu Man Chu.. Oh Aww!</segment8>
		<segment9>And it's a great day to be alive. I know the sun's still shinin when I close my eyes. There's some hard times in the neigborhood. But why can't every day be just this good?</segment9>
		<segment10>And it's a great day to be alive. I know the sun's still shinin when I close my eyes. There's some hard times in the neigborhood. But why can't every day be just this good?    </segment10>
