		<segment1>For so long we walk in darkness. Hoping to find the way. But without something or someone to guide us. We stumble blindly day after day</segment1>
		<segment2>So He lights candles in hopes that we'll see. Glimpses of Him in this mystery. That we'll leave shadows and move toward the flame. And we move closer we'll see His face..</segment2>
		<segment3>To face with the One who made mountains. Who hung the stars in the sky. He is love and loved us so much. That He was willing to die</segment3>
		<segment4>Dies for the man on the corner. Who sold his soul years ago. And now knows of only regret. To trade His life for the woman. Who doesn't think mercy. Is something that she'll ever get</segment4>
		<segment5>Hope to all who are hopeless. Who've ever known kindness. He has not forgotten your name. You are loved by the One Who. With His Own hands has made you. And love you forever the same    </segment5>
