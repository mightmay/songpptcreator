		<segment1>Times like these I see people. Giving their lives away. For someone else' sake. I see so many hurting faces. Such emptiness inside. And someone took the time. To be the hands and feet. To reach to those in need. To live with arms open wide</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Shouldn't love be a way of life. Something we do all the time. We could make a difference if we dared to care. To give like our Savior gave. Imagine what this world would be like. If love was a way of life</segment2>
		<segment3>Help me follow where you lead me. Keep this heart open. And run to the broken. And let it not just be a season. Let this be forever. To bring us all together. To be the hands and feet. To reach to those in need. To live with arms open wide</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Love will lead us. Love will bring us home. Love will lead us. Love will bring us home. Woah. Love will lead us. Love will bring us home. Woah. Love will lead us. Love will bring us home</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS x2    </segment6>
