		<segment1>Many choose to find their hope in the thoughts of afterlife, When there is none to be found right here before we die. So I understand the feeling of helplessness, When we are just taught to wait here.. wait here for death.</segment1>
		<segment2>Wait here for death. Wait for this suffering to end. Wait here for death. Wait here for death. Wait for this suffering to end.</segment2>
		<segment3>We are not forgotten, for a kingdom is offered beyond that of golden streets. We can represent now what will one day be complete.</segment3>
		<segment4>Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled. And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise). This is a kingdom born upside-down. This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned.</segment4>
		<segment5>Wait here for death. Wait here for death. The &quot;blessings&quot; of excess are only a burden on us.</segment5>
		<segment6>It is a broken system where we just wait for death. It is a broken system where suffering can never end.</segment6>
		<segment7>Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled. And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise). This is a kingdom born upside-down. This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned.. (the broken are crowned).</segment7>
		<segment8>If helplessness is our system then were better off upside-down.    </segment8>
