		<segment1>Playing my heart so many times. There's always a weak hand holding mine. Saying the way that I have said &quot;this is the way&quot;. Every scene is still the same. Just with a difference faceless name. Falling and breaking, cleaning I am holding on so</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). This is where my heart is longs to be. Hurting you, needing you. This is where I always want to be. Suffering</segment2>
		<segment3>Every night you come to see. Beautiful faces playing me. And the fallen lives and crimson walls. Reflect my lines. Breaking through thoughts and mindless games. Your love is a whisper coming clean. And behind the curtains I can see you're not impressed with me</segment3>
		<segment4>Can you take everything that I hold. Will you wash away just what the past is?    </segment4>
