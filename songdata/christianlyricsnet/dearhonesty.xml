		<segment1>Divided devotion, controlled passion, And theories of purity that remain hypotheses, Plural allegiances, and dual monogamy, These lies are the ghosts that haunt the. Graveyard of normality. </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm cutting compromise from today's routine. Hold fast to integrity, I won't let it go. </segment2>
		<segment3>Keep me, honesty. </segment3>
		<segment4>Honesty, these luxuries I have left behind. And I'm on my way.     </segment4>
