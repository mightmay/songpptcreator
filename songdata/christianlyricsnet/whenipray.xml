		<segment1>I was sold to slavery. My brothers moved by jealousy. Father's favor to a well. My Master's favor to a prison cell. But still your kindness stayed with me. I knew someday that you would set me free. Through it all your grace was shown. My confidence in you has only grown</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>When I pray. I feel that you are near. When I cry. You're there to dry my tears. When I shout. You're the only one who really hears. When I pray</segment3>
		<segment4>I was in the field the day that Your anointing came my way. Through the lion. Through the bear. From the giant to the Kingdom's chair. From deadly spears of jealousy. To weaknesses exposed of me. Cast me not away from thee. Create a brand-new heart in me</segment4>
		<segment5>( Repeat Chorus x2 )</segment5>
		<segment6>Praying in Gethsemane. I know you saw the ones like me. The cross you freely chose to bear. It was my sin that nailed you there. Now you mediate for me. So I can pray confidently. When I pray     </segment6>
