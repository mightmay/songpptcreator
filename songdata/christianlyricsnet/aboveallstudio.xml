		<segment1>Above all powers above all kings. Above all nature and all created things. Above all wisdom and all the ways of man. You were here before the world began</segment1>
		<segment2>Above all kindgoms above all thrones. Above all wonders the world has ever known. Above all wealth and treasure of the earth. There's no way to measure what You're worth</segment2>
		<segment3>Crucified laid behind a stone. You lived to die rejected and alone. Like a rose trampled on the ground. You took the fall and thought of me. Above all    </segment3>
