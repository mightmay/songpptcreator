		<segment1>He can't sleep, he can't eat. He keeps thinking about her behind the locked door of her bedroom. As she knowingly tortures the shell that is left of her bridegroom. And what did he do to deserve. This whore of a wife who parades her disgrace to his face now. When he loved her and gave up his life in more ways than she knows how. And all I can say is that</segment1>
		<segment2>Love is a terrible art, its a hook in the heart. That can drag you on broken glass. And as you protest the shards in your flesh. The hook tears out your chest until youre just a broken mess</segment2>
		<segment3>Where is God in this rot?. Depraved she commits the most heinous of sins and breaks her vows. But he loves her despite all the crimes she devises in his house. Where is God? Ive been taught. That Hes close to the broken, it's true I have spoken with Him some. When I look in my brother's eyes I can see where his love comes from. And all he can say is that</segment3>
		<segment4>Love is a terrible art, its a hook in the heart. That can drag you on broken glass. And as you protest the shards in your flesh. The hook tears out your chest until youre just a broken mess</segment4>
		<segment5>But he has mercy on her lover and does not bleed him dry. A credit to his self control if it were me that monster would probably die</segment5>
		<segment6>Love is a beautiful thing, she can make your heart sing. When youre walking on broken glass. She will open your eyes, make your heart feel alive. Point you toward the sunrise. Help you leave all this broken mess behind</segment6>
		<segment7>Love is a beautiful thing. Will you leave this broken mess behind?     </segment7>
