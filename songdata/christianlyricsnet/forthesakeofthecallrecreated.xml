		<segment1>Nobody stood and applauded them. So they knew from the start. This road would not lead to fame. All they really knew for sure was Jesus had called to them. He said &quot;Come follow me&quot; and they came. With reckless abandon they came</segment1>
		<segment2>Empty nets lying there at the waters edge. Told a story that few could believe and none could explain. How some crazy fishermen agreed to go where Jesus lead. With no thought for what they would gain. For Jesus had called them by name and they answered</segment2>
		<segment3>We will abandon it all for the sake of the call. No other reason at all but the sake of the call. Wholly devoted to live and to die. For the sake of the call</segment3>
		<segment4>Drawn like the rivers are drawn to the sea. No turning back for the water cannot help but flow. Once we hear the Savior's call we'll follow wherever he leads. Because of the love He has shown. And because he has called us to go we will answer</segment4>
		<segment5>We will abandon it all for the sake of the call. No other reason at all but the sake of the call. Wholly devoted to live and to die</segment5>
		<segment6>Not for the sake of a creed or a cause. Not for a dream or a promise. Simply because it is Jesus who calls. And if we believe we'll obey</segment6>
		<segment7>We will abandon it all for the sake of the call. No other reason at all but the sake of the call. Wholly devoted to live and to die. For the sake of the call    </segment7>
