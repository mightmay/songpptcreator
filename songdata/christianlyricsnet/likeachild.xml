		<segment1>Dear God, Surround me as I speak, The bridges that I walk across are weak. Frustrations fill the void that I can't solely bare </segment1>
		<segment2>Dear God, Don't let me fall apart. You've held me close to you. I have turned away and searched for answers. I can't understand </segment2>
		<segment3>They say that I can move the mountains. And send them falling to the sea. They say that I can walk on water. If I would follow and believe. With Faith Like a Child </segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes, When I feel miles away. And my eyes can't see your face. I wonder if I've grown to lose. The recklessness I walked in light of you </segment4>
		<segment5>They say that I can move the mountains. And send them crashing to the sea. They say that I can walk on water. If I would follow and believe. With Faith Like a Child </segment5>
		<segment6>They say that love can heal the broken. They say that hope can make you see. They say that faith can find a Savior. If you would follow and believe. With Faith Like a Child    </segment6>
