		<segment2>We're young and so in love. We'll be together, so let's go. Let's go away</segment2>
		<segment3>So let's just go tonight. Just you and me, we'll be alright. Have some fun. Waiting for me to say. Let's go to Californ-i-a. In the sun</segment3>
		<segment4>We're young and so in love. We'll be together, so let's go. Let's go away</segment4>
		<segment5>Darling, darling let's go. We'll feel the wind on our face. Darling, darling I know. I feel it, too. So let's storm the castles. And all the places we never knew. Just as long as you're there with me</segment5>
