		<segment1>vs1. down to the wire of words that arent said. and im building the pieces together in my head. to make a place i sleep soundly. a place i think clearly. oh, where do we go. where do we go from here</segment1>
		<segment2>theres a sign in the yard and a lump in my throat. a new plot of land and fresh lumber is in tow. two kids in their car seats and hope for our history. and letting it go. letting it go from here</segment2>
		<segment3>ch. i need a builder, a better design. a house with more windows and more ways inside</segment3>
		<segment4>vs2. were leaving behind all that our parents wrote. were replacing the past and all our fathers hopes. with a new street address and a new bag of tools. to make room as we grow. room as we grow from here</segment4>
		<segment5>ch. we need a builder, a better design. a house with more windows and more ways inside    </segment5>
