		<segment1>I'm unstable and extreme. good to bad , I've been burnt in between. the smoke from the fire in my soul. makes a transparent haze. There are things that I can't hide. that would make some people think I've lied. I try to do right but I fail. don't set your eyes on me </segment1>
		<segment2>I drive all night to sing this song. but I don't even care. Some people want a piece of me. but I've got none to share </segment2>
		<segment3>Don't you know that God loves you. Don't you know that I try too. I've been known to miss my cue. Don't look at me I'm see through </segment3>
		<segment4>I would love to be made perfect. but instead I have the grace of God. you should look through me. and you will see what I want to be     </segment4>
