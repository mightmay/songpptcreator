		<segment1>the first time I loved her it was here. they discovered us. playing in the ponds with toads. and leafy dragons. the first time I loved her it was here. afternoons in the fall. nothing but to wonder. where now should we wander?. sleep on beds of grass. awoken by our hunger</segment1>
		<segment2>the first time I loved her it was here. leaves upon the stark landscape. we supposed the world. would never change us. the first time I loved her it was here. secrets left in hearts. you withdrew your hand. to see what lay behind us. I could never plead enough. to make you hold on</segment2>
		<segment3>the first time I loved her it was here. faces strained in doubt. bodies in unseemly gestures. the obscene shrieks. the first time I loved her it was here. shameless utterance. agonies that freeze, prolong what memories have. brought to wasted birth. assembled points of regret. languish with despair. the trees will droop and wither. winter will remain. the sadness of our weather</segment3>
		<segment4>the first time I loved her it was here    </segment4>
