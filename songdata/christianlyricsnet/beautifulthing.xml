		<segment1>I want a Pavarotti voice. 'Cause I'm a scary Connick. A solo show with the Philharmonic. No fake Monet. Hey, the real Van Gogh. ASeventeen, Cover Girl, Vogue, Cosmo</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Whoo-hoo-hoo. It's a beautiful thing / Whoo-hoo-hoo. To be loved by you / Whoo-hoo-hoo. Oh, that'll be enough to get me through. It's a beautiful thing</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll take the Rockies gift-wrapped. Or the Grand Tetons. Add a truckload of those cherry bon-bons. A '54 fire red collector's car. A doggy-bag trip to the money super bar</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. Whoo-hoo-hoo. It's a beautiful thing / Whoo-hoo-hoo. To be loved by you / Whoo-hoo-hoo. Oh, that'll be enough to get me through. It's a beautiful thing</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE. There's no trade. Nothing could persuade. I'm no fool. You're so beautiful. Yeah, so beautiful. Yeah</segment5>
