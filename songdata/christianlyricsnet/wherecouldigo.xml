		<segment1>Out of Eden's fall. I'm still falling here. At the garden wall. Serpents in my ear. Whispers and lies. Telling me to turn my eyes. But I don't know what else to do. And bring my brokenness to you</segment1>
		<segment2>Where could I go. But into your presence. Where could I run. But into your arms. All of my roads. Lead to this redemption. Father you know the way nobody knows. So where could I go</segment2>
		<segment3>Wounded as the ground. We all walk upon. Love held to the cross cried out mercy song. Still we break and bend by the weight of all our sin. There is nothing we can do. But bring our weariness to you</segment3>
		<segment4>Where could I go. But into your presence. Where could I run. But into your arms. All of my roads. Lead to this redemption. Father you know the way nobody knows. So where could I go</segment4>
		<segment5>We come just as we are. We come just as we are. We come just as we are. We come just as we are</segment5>
		<segment6>Where could I go. But into your presence. Where could I run. But into your arms. All of my roads. Lead to this redemption. Father you know the way nobody knows. So where could I go</segment6>
		<segment7>Where could I go. But into your presence. Where could I run. But into your arms. All of my roads. Lead to this redemption. Father you know the way nobody knows. Father you know the way nobody knows. So where could I go. Where could I go. Where could I go    </segment7>
