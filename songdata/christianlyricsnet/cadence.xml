		<segment1>Write down,to remind yourself on how it can be. Heartstrings, you're tugging at my heartstrings. Helpless, I have become so helpless to your touch. touch me somehow. Restless, you leave me restless. breathless wait for me </segment1>
		<segment2>The closer I come to you. the closer I am to finding God. You're a miracle to me. The closer I come to you. the closer I am to finding God. You're a miracle to me </segment2>
		<segment3>Burning, like Joan of Arc to see you, just to feel you. Cadence, I would dance with the dead cause I believe. yes I believe, yes I believe. Stifle, Paul said that you stifle him. again and again and again </segment3>
		<segment4>And if these are my parting words. Then this, my last request. Hold me here, until I sleep. If I burn, then I burn for you     </segment4>
