		<segment1>Nothing can stop me, I am not gonna change my mind. No one can keep me from the road that Im on this time. No matter what, Im going to do what it takes to make it. I didnt know what I was missing till I met you. I never even thought to listen, no, I never knew. And now youve given me a second chance and Ill take it. So here I am Lord, I want to be where you are. I need you now, wont you show me the way?. Everywhere you go, I wanna go, will you take me with you?. Everywhere you lead, I wanna be by your side. Everyone you love, I wanna love, just like you love me. Everywhere you go, I wanna go there with you. It doesnt matter how long this is gonna take me. Im gonna take on moving even if it breaks me. Ill never turn around, I have found where I am going    </segment1>
