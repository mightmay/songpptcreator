		<segment1>Yo, I don't appreciate you telling me the way that I should live. No, I think the choices you've laid out for me, the end is negative. So, take all your imagery and ideology, yes I'll be fine. When you go, I'd rather not display my physical I'd rather use my mind. You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing. Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring. I know that I am more than that (don't believe the hype). The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life </segment1>
		<segment2>Ohhh, I don't need you to define my b-e-a-u-t-y. I'd rather draw the line. Ohhh, I don't need you on my team, what you've selling's a pipe dream. And I don't need it baby </segment2>
		<segment3>Hey! It seems a shame to me I've been reduced to an object of lust and hate. No way! Please understand that I refuse to be simply a height and weight. This day, somewhere we've lost the value of what a woman is supposed to be. A queen, respected and defined by her creator, size 24, 10, or size 3. You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing. Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring. I know that I am more than that (don't believe the hype). The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life </segment3>
		<segment4>It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride. I'm no showpiece for you to hide, and lose all that I am inside. God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl. R-e-s-p-e-c-t ,that's the way that you got to look at me</segment4>
