		<segment1>Here I go round and round again. Venti Chai, youre my closest friend. Lack of sleep is what I do. Starbucks will rescue me again</segment1>
		<segment2>Work, more work, and somewhere to be. Skip the talk, cant you just text me. Im goin, slow down, Im on it. Im going crazy </segment2>
		<segment3>Cause when its work all day. I cannot escape. I just stop to think, and Im going crazy. Take a break, hey. Sometimes you got to. Be still and breathe, baby. Here we go, better believe we can up and leave. Take some time and kickback. Im on chill and relax. Work can wait, yeah, time to play, yeah. Im away on holiday. Take my time and kickback. Im on chill and relax. Rock the beat, yeah, time to play, yeah. Im away on holiday </segment3>
		<segment4>Is this boy the one?. Are we meant to be?. What to wear?. Got to look pretty. Maybe I should go solo. Forget it, Im ready to go where theres no. No more drama to mess up my flow. No more questions to answer, no. Pack my bags yall, Im outtie. Flight leaves gate 17 </segment4>
		<segment5>Rock, rock the beat, rock, rock the beat. Rock, rock the beat, rock, rock the beat</segment5>
		<segment6>No lap top bringing. Or cell phone ringing. You know the feeling. When hits you are singing. Ill kick back and enjoy the sun on my face. The time of my life baby, its time to play. If youre ready for a holiday, holiday. Rock the beat, hands in the air. If youre ready for a holiday, holiday. Rock the beat, rock the beat, yeah    </segment6>
