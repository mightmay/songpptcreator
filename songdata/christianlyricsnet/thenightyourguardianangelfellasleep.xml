		<segment1>It would take an army of angels to restore her health back to herself. Her heart belongs to another. A boy whose mystery exaggerates. She won't be hard to save. So where's the show?. Somebody's gotta know. We're coming out tonight. When her car goes up in flames. We'll find a way to take away her pain. Don't kill the fire. Just kill the girl. We'll sort this out when you get back, don't let her go. Who picked her up in the ambulance!. Who picked her up!.     </segment1>
