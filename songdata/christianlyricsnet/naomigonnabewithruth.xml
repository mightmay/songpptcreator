		<segment1>Ruth and me, We come from different worlds. She was a Moabite;. I'm a Jewish mother's girl. Somehow she married a son of mine. It's such a shame because my sons and husband died. But there's nothing I could do. I said, Ruth, I'm gonna go back home. She looked at me, She had something left to say: I'm gonna follow you and with you I will stay. I won't let you just leave, Because, Mom, I love you and you are my family. And there's nothing you can do;. Naomi gonna be with Ruth. I will call on your God, too, Naomi gonna be with Ruth. Went home to live in Bethlehem, Seen all my friends. I said, my family collapsed when all the men died, But Ruth has not abandoned me, Changed my life to bittersweet. She was married to one of my sons, And when he died, She came with me. I'd better help her find a hubby;. Naomi gonna see her through. Somebody local;. A lonely guy who needs her, too. And I think I know just who. Naomi gonna see with Ruth. You can call me old school;. Naomi gonna be with Ruth. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been. If Ruth abandoned me when I told her to back then. Ruth had a baby and on down the line. Great grandson David, yeah, the one who fought the giant. And there's the King of the Jews;. I know you've heard of Jesus, too. If you call Him, Lord, too, Naomi gonna be with you. And he came from out of Ruth. Naomi gonna be with Ruth. Naomi gonna be with Ruth. Naomi gonna be with Ruth. Naomi gonna be with Ruth.     </segment1>
