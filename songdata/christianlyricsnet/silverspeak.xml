		<segment1>They spoke their minds. As I stood there smiling. This brain understood their arguments. So I just stood there. Keep on smiling. Cause it's not on me they're throwing their darts. So why are they heading this way for my heart?</segment1>
		<segment2>How come I'm the one bleeding. When you're the one being cut. And every stabbing word about you stings</segment2>
		<segment3>An allergic reaction towards all of this. Have to respond, although without an answer back. And I throw everything back into their face. Hear my own stupid sentences and I have lost track</segment3>
		<segment4>You have strength beyond words. And You have communication beyond my words</segment4>
		<segment5>This battle is not mine. I try to forget. Every time they spit Your name out on the sidewalk. And I will let the candle shine inside me without any regret. But where's Your voice in all my talk</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm an ant trying to protect my dinosaur friend    </segment6>
