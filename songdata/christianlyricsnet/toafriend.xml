		<segment1>no words can express the emptiness i felt. nothing can hide the way we felt inside. stripped of our emotions. forced to reconcile. the suffering of a friend consumed us all the while. the rituals of life seem to lose their shine. so many times we let life pass by. so many times we don't even try. feelign so useless. feeling so afraid. awkward silence. unsure of what to say. drowning in an ocean full of sorrow. promise no today. promise no tommorrow. look back and remember the times we shared. we were so much stronger. we were never scared. never give up. never give in. this is the battle we must win. and when you're in the depths of despair. know that i will be there. we will be there. we'll comfort you. we'll carry you.. until the end    </segment1>
