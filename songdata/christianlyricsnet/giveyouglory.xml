		<segment1>We have raised a thousand voices just to lift your holy name. And we will raise thousands more to sing of your beauty in this place. None can even fathom, No, not one define your worth. As we marvel in your presence to the ends of the earth</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. We give you glory, lifting up our hands and singing Holy, You alone are Worthy, We just want to touch your heart Lord, touch your heart. Glory, lifting up our voice and singing holy, You alone are Worthy, We just want to touch your heart Lord, touch your heart</segment2>
		<segment3>As we fall down before you with our willing hearts we seek. In the greatness of your glory, itÂ’s so hard to even speak. There is nothing we can offer, no nothing can repay. So we give all our praises, and lift our voice to sing</segment3>
		<segment4>Our hope is drenched in you, Our faith has been renewed. We trust in your every word. Nothing else can even measure up to you </segment4>
