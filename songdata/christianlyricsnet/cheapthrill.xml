		<segment1>He was an honest man. Sincere in thought. Traded it for lust and simply forgot just what it meant for him to be. Rooted in thought by negate depravity. But the tides soon rose. His faith bottomed out. In came the waves world upside down. Hurt his loved. Loved his hate. All eyes on him now this they say.. &quot;You were to be the best.&quot;. Five more years gone by but it's all a blur. Motionless thoughts race by now. Soon confirm the void that's there cannot be fulfilled. From the empty times. By those cheap thrill after thrill. Clock in and clock out. When all said and done who will be around?. Hurt his loved. Loved his hate. All eyes on him now this they say..     </segment1>
