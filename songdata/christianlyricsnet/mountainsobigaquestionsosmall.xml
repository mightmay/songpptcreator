		<segment1>Another child is born into this pain, And the unfortunate die slow. </segment1>
		<segment2>Who do we blame?. Give our fingers a place to go. Give us a name that youknow. They know. We all know. </segment2>
		<segment3>A God we can't see. (is barking orders). A thought and a dream. (is more as it seems). As children play in thestreet. (children are also crying). As they choose what to eat. (childrenare also dying) </segment3>
		<segment4>One question started off, And now there is more. Areanswers found in hats of thorns?. What is the point?. He's given us all a choice. We'll flip a coin, And rejoice, rejoice, We rejoice! </segment4>
		<segment5>Thedrowning are asking. &quot;Who'll stop the rain?. Have the angels all goneaway?&quot;. The suffering's not passing. &quot;Who will stop the pain?&quot; </segment5>
		<segment6>A God we can't see. (is barking orders). A thought and a dream. (is more as it seems). As children play in thestreet. (children are also crying). As they choose what to eat. (childrenare also dying).     </segment6>
