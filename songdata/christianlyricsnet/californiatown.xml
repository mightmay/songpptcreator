		<segment1>Good evening. Lovely evening. A perfect evening. For a stroll on the town. Couples on the boardwalk. And down on the sandbar. Holding hands, staring out. To the moon on the ocean. Silver and soft. Water in motion </segment1>
		<segment2>Car lights. Pacific Highway. We look both ways. My baby and me. We find a fancy restaurant. A table outside. In a quiet corner, please. Wind in the palm trees. Candles and wine. Her clear blue eyes. We stay till closing </segment2>
		<segment3>Come on, my love. We can walk home. Past the dancers. And the bands winding down. Remind me again. What's the question?. We belong here. In this California town </segment3>
		<segment4>Slow fade of summer. Stars in the sky. Songs in the night. The boom of the breakers </segment4>
		<segment5>The pull of the tide. The swell and the sigh. Salt in the sea spray    </segment5>
