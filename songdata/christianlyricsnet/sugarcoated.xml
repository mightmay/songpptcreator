		<segment1>talk in circles near incessant. and effervesce here in our presence. bubble up, bubble break. a burst of warm air rises and disappears. wasted words a black hole finds them. pull, pull me past event horizon. round and round, nothing found. the gravity of speaking small gets me down. talk about the weather, long as we're together. on and on and over again. current pulling under, do you ever wonder how. we made it this far?. sift the debris in search of purpose. shimmering beneath the surface. I concede, I consent. it's necessary, but I don't have to like it    </segment1>
