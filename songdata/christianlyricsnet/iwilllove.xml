		<segment1>I will love you, Lord, my strength. I belong to you. And I will bless you while I live. And I will lift my hands up in your name.</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, you alone are Holy. You alone are Holy. Name above every name. Lord Jesus, you alone are worthy. You alone are worthy. Jesus, the lamb that was slain.</segment2>
		<segment3>Nailed to the cross for me. Died and rose again. You redeemed me to the father. By your blood. You cleansed me from all sin.     </segment3>
