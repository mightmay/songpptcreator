		<segment1>I'm not the only one who can't see why it crossed your mind. I see your life and death reduce into a product line. It's not enough to see you speaking through the blindest of eyes. The same dead, cold breath is reducing mine. I can't see why. You're not a saint, you're a thief. You can't deny. It's all a ploy underneath. . All I've seen (you better learn to keep your face under the dark). All I need (wake up and feel the blood escape your heart). Your disease (for every word that you devalue and mistake). I can't breathe (for every soul you nauseate with what you say). . CHORUS: You've brought this verdict on yourself (before we ever had a chance). I hope you cry for the one's you've lost. You built this burden when you fell (you know we never took a glance). I hope it's worth all the blood it cost. . It's been a long way back from the dissipated path. Only half way through, say goodbye and take a breath. And when the end shines new with the burn of nothing left. I'll give you one last chance to say you're done and give it back. I won't agree. Your remedy is a joke. I can't believe. That you can breathe and not choke. . (CHORUS). . Peddle your faith to the blind. And cheapen the love that you feel so painful. Pushing the guilt through your spine. And suffer the mold of a prime example. . (CHORUS). . I feel my lungs beginning to burn. With every foolish word that you spit, another nail you'll get.    </segment1>
