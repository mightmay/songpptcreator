		<segment1>This car turned over without a key or gasoline tonight. Feel everything on fire and I'm dressed to kill killing for your dress goodnight. Help me to wait on you, hesitate it too, cause I'm alone. Feel so jaded, contemplative, waiting for you </segment1>
		<segment2>We're running hot tonight and it feels so good. Your arm in mine here near midnight and it feels so right. Girls and the boys chase down running hot tonight </segment2>
		<segment3>Running down the ready fuels it's finally over, just get over. Time will tell if all turns out ok. Help me to realize my dream is dying redefine despair. I turned away. So look the other way tonight </segment3>
		<segment4>Can you wait for me a little longer/stronger?     </segment4>
