		<segment1>I feel it in your eyes. There's pain that covers up these lies. Now you may look like me. But it seems you're really different on the inside</segment1>
		<segment2>We used to keep our hearts safe. We kept them safe and locked away. But then we grew up learning. That life could serve us in a better way</segment2>
		<segment3>And why?. I'm asking you why?</segment3>
		<segment4>So what happened to your eyes. I saw them wander just like mine. So how did we come to see so differently. After all this time</segment4>
		<segment5>If the sheep know his voice then tell me what is the choice. For the ones who haven't heard and have no need to rejoice. Father, help me understand. Cause I am just like him and Lord he's just like me. We came from the same town and the same families. But now he, he just won't understand. Please Lord open up his eyes. Can you open these eyes?</segment5>
