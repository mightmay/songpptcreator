		<segment1>It was on a day like no other. Seeking your face when I discovered. My life was no longer my own, but yours. Then I heard you say, Go and tell them. To open your heart, let me in and I will supply your everyneed. Then I cried, Lord, I dont know if I can do it. You will find your strength in me. Only believe. Then I said, What if I fail? I just couldnt take it. He said, I have given you my ability</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: For the sake of the call. I am laying down my all. No turning back. Moving straight ahead. Im on the right track. And its all for the sake of the call</segment2>
		<segment3>Sister, let me encourage your heart. Brother, leave doubt behind, stay your part. Know that hes with you, yes, Hes there all the time. You may feel like you cant go on any longer. Though you are weak, remember hes stronger. Through Him you can do most anything. You might cry Lord I dont know if I can do it. You will find your strength in him only believe. You might say, What if I fail? I just couldnt take it. He has given you the ability</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Daily I press toward the mark for the prize. Of the high calling of God in Jesus our Lord    </segment5>
