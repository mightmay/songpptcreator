		<segment1>Amidst the sorrows of the way. Lord Jesus, teach my soul to pray. Let me taste Thy special grace. And run to Christ, my hiding place</segment1>
		<segment2>You know the vileness of my heart. So prone to act the rebel's part. And when You veil Your lovely face. How can I find a hiding place</segment2>
		<segment3>Hiding place, hiding place</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, guide my wandering feet. Draw me to Thy mercy seat. I've nought to trust but sovereign grace. Thou only art my hiding place</segment4>
		<segment5>How unstable is my heart. Sometimes I take the tempter's part. And slight the tokens of Thy grace. And seem to want no hiding place</segment5>
		<segment6>Hiding place, hiding place</segment6>
		<segment7>But when Thy spirit shines within. Makes me feel the plague of sin. And how I long to see Thy face. 'Tis then I want a hiding place</segment7>
		<segment8>Lord Jesus, shine and then I can. Feel sweetness in salvation's plan. And as a sinner plead for grace. Christ, the sinner's hiding place. And as a sinner plead for grace. Christ, the sinner's hiding place    </segment8>
