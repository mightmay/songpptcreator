		<segment1>The hand that feeds the fire. The lips that taste the smoke. All together once again. The moon that hangs so pale. The dark that makes you choke. Comes to cover you again </segment1>
		<segment2>Stay close you people with your broken hearts. I stand before you as a witness. Hold tight to the man that stands in front of you. As we move toward the light </segment2>
		<segment3>The will that knows no end. The eyes that see your heart. Come to look on you once more. The word that shakes the ground. The voice that clams the sea. Stands knocking at your door </segment3>
		<segment4>Stay close you people with your broken hearts. I stand before you as a witness. Hold tight to the man that stands in front of you. As we move toward the light.     </segment4>
