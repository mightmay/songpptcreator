		<segment1>Come back and haunt me, follow me home. Give me a motive, swallow me whole. They say I've lost it. What could I know when I'm but a mockery?. I'm so alone </segment1>
		<segment2>Sooner or later. You'll find out there's a hole in the wall. Sooner or later. You'll find out there's a hole in the wall </segment2>
		<segment3>Today is ours, condemned to be free. Free to keep breathing, free to believe. I look to find You, down on my knees. Oh, God, I believe, please help me believe </segment3>
		<segment4>Sooner or later. They'll find out there's a hole in the wall. Sooner or later. You'll find out that you'll dream to be that small </segment4>
		<segment5>I'm a believer, help me believe. I'm a believer, help me believe </segment5>
		<segment6>I gave it all away and I lost who I am. I threw it all away with everything to gain. And I'm taking the leap with dreams of shrinking. Dreams of shrinking, dreams of shrinking. Dreams of shrinking </segment6>
		<segment7>Come back and haunt me, follow me home. Give me a motive, swallow me whole </segment7>
		<segment8>Sooner or later. Sooner or later. Sooner or later     </segment8>
