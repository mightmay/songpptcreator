		<segment1>Too many voices, It won't take long. Which one's right, which one's wrong. Yours is most likely to be misunderstood. Screaming in tongues. On the top of my lungs. 'Til i find you, 'Til you found me. Somehow i always knew that you would. And i am contemplating matters. All this cling and clatter. In my head, and what you said. Is ringing, ringing faster. And it's all good if you would. Stop the world from making sense. And if i could just realize. It doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter. It doesn't really matter. If i could touch. The sound of silence now. You know i would if i knew how. To make these intentions. Come around. I'm hearing without listening. And believing every word. You are not saying. Speaking without a sound. Trapped inside. Of these four walls. Walking brainless muppet dolls. Mushroom face. Beneath the tangles. Bleeding silhouette inside. Dancing like an angel would.     </segment1>
