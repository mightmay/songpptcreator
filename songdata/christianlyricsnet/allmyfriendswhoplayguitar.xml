		<segment1>This is what you do for a name. You wanna waste your life in a country. And fly around on a plane?. We did the same. We drove in cars and flew around on planes</segment1>
		<segment2>And never thought it'd go this far. We never thought that. We'd ever go far. Like all my friends who play guitar. Know who we are?. We never go far. Like all my friends who play guitar</segment2>
		<segment3>So this is what we did for a name. We took a taste of life in a country. And fly around on planes. We do the same. We drive in cars and fly around on planes</segment3>
		<segment4>And never thought it'd go this far. We never thought that. We'd ever go far. Like all my friends who play guitar. Know who we are?. We never go far. Like all my friends who play guitar</segment4>
		<segment5>Know who we are?. We never go far. Like all my friends who play guitar    </segment5>
