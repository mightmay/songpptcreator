		<segment1>Killer, killer, I know where you live. Action on the big screen. Vile, thriller, how much would you give. to see blood spill on the TV. Torture, torture, blood curdling scream. Hear it in stereo. Creepy, wicked, pulls out his knife. We do it all for show. Gutterbox! Do you think for your-. self or follow the box of deceit. BRAINDEAD! Can't believe all you see. A nation of lost sheep. Gutterbox! Garbage in garbage out, that trash corrodes your mind. BRAINDEAD! Open up your eyes. before it robs you blind. Solo-Steve. Racist, racist, burning a cross, what a killer show. Rapist, rapist, stalking his prey. How far will we go. Murder, murder, desensitize, over and over again. Twisting, warping, led to believe, that your thoughts are your own. Gutterbox! Do you think for your-. self or follow the box of deceit. BRAINDEAD! Can't believe all you see. A nation of lost sheep. Gutterbox! Garbage in garbage out, that trash corrodes your mind. BRAINDEAD! Open up your eyes. before it robs you blind.     </segment1>
