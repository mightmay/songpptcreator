		<segment1>Wait. Wait, I can hardly wait. To look into Your face. When the world disappears into Your eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>Wait, I can hardly wait. To hear your sweet voice say. You've done well, my good and faithful son</segment2>
		<segment3>Breathe, I can hardly breathe. In anticipation. Waithing for the day to come. When You will shine on me</segment3>
		<segment4>Wait, I can hardly wait. To bow at Your feet. Kiss the scars that bore my sins away. I can hardly breathe In anticipation. Waiting for the day to come. When You will shine on me</segment4>
		<segment5>Wait, I can hardly wait    </segment5>
