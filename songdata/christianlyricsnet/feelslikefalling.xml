		<segment1>(Na na na na na na na na) </segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 1: When I'm with you I feel a rush. 'Cause I've never liked anyone so much. Everybody says that it's just a crush. But I think it's something more. Sunny skys or cloudy days. You always seem to make them great. Letting you know might be a mistake. But that's what being young is for </segment2>
		<segment3>Pre-chorus 1: It's not because I'm bored or lonely. I just wanna be you're one and only </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling. Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling </segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 2: Who knows? This could be the one. It's way to good to be out-down. Now I don't really wanna jump the gun. But I can't help fallin' in </segment5>
		<segment6>Pre-chorus 2: It's not because I'm bored or lonely. I just wanna be you're one and only </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus: Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling. Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling. Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling. Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling </segment7>
		<segment8>Bridge: Straight into the everafter. Of a story's ending chapter. Or this could be a huge disaster. If I start falling any faster </segment8>
		<segment9>Na na na na na na na na. One, two, three, four! </segment9>
		<segment10>Chorus: Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling. Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling. Na na na na na na na na. Feels like falling    </segment10>
