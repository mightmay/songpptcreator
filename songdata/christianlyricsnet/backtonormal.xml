		<segment1>Such a lovely day to carry on your shoulders. It turned from blue to grey and you seem so much older. But its worth all the money in the world to find a way back to normal. If theres such a place</segment1>
		<segment2>The doctor called your name and things became so sober. I suppose the price well pay will be worth it when its over. But it takes every effort to believe in the unseen when you see clearly. That things are not okay</segment2>
		<segment3>Well I know you are frightened, and I know you are angry. And I know you tired of the unknown. But I am beside you, and I will remind you. That you dont have to go it alone</segment3>
		<segment4>Seems a tailor made sickness for your sins dear. If you planned your life away we never would be standing here. But with an impending bitter end. You have learned the lesson how. The sweet is in the now</segment4>
		<segment5>Well I know you are frightened, and I know you are angry. And I know you tired of the unknown. But I am beside you, and I will remind you. That you dont have to go it alone. Alone, Alone, We are not alone, Alone, Alone, Never, Not alone</segment5>
		<segment6>There are no guarantees, no promise they can make us. Our faiths a fighting seed planted deep in desperate trust. I will take every moment I can get. And wont regret I share your name. To Love is worth the pain     </segment6>
