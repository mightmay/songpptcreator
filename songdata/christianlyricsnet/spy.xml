		<segment1>I've watched you watchin' me. But I can't see what you see. You ask me how I feel. But you don't believe me still </segment1>
		<segment2>No. Cause what I say. Is here today. And gone tomorrow </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: You treat me like a spy. When I come around. Just like a private eye. Roamin' through your town. You treat me like a spy. And I can't see why. If only looks could kill </segment3>
		<segment4>You taunt me. You doubt my faith. But you shove it in my face. You tempt me. But I won't bend. You've wasted your time again </segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah. And it's a shame. Will you ever change. You're so suspicious </segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>You treat me like a. You treat me like a. You treat me like a spy     </segment7>
