		<segment1>Well I burned my past. I sent it up in flames. I threw away my keys. I got my name changed</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't you remember me: always on the run?. I got the sunshine on. And I'm growing fast. You will never see me crawl again</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: All hands up: who has had enough?. Come on make your mind up. All hands all hands up</segment3>
		<segment4>All hands up: anyone strong enough?. The world needs someone tough. All hands all hands up</segment4>
		<segment5>Where's the Truth?. Something Absolute?. I'd give everything I have. For something I don't have to prove</segment5>
		<segment6>Who's going to stand with me?. Who's it going to be?. This is just to die for. It takes a fool to see. You will never ever crawl again</segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus]    </segment7>
