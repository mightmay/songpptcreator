		<segment1>This is a song about stuff that I hate. Momma always said that hate was a strong, strong word. Poppa always said that words of hate should never be heard. But I'm getting older and I just cannot lie. There are things I hate, no matter how hard I try. I hate traffic, I hate dirt in my eyes. I hate spiders, and I hate girlfriends that lie. I hate cancer, I hate cauliflower pie. But most of all, I hate my ex-girlfriend's new guy, I hate that guy. The good book says that we should love everyone. And I'm doing my best, but it's easier said than done. This new guy was a good friend of mine before. Caught him with my girl in his mustang ford. I hate taxes, I hate stink bugs and flies. I hate rug burns, and I hate poke dot ties. I hate Mike Tyson, 'cause bite your ear then bust you in the eye. But most of all, I hate my ex-girlfriend's new guy, I hate that guy. I was sittin' down by myself, I was having a coke. I heard someone laughing real loud at a real dumb joke. I recognized the voice so I turned around. It was my ex-girlfriend's new guy, can't stand that clown. He walked up to me with a really sorry look on his face. And he said, man I done you wrong but now she's gone and I've been replaced. I know I don't deserve to have you as a friend because I played the fool. But I'm really hurtin' man, can I just pull up a stool. So he started crying and saying how he loved that girl. She got with a new guy and it rocked his world. He asked me how I dealt with it when she dumped me. And I said, I just talked about stuff I hate man, it's like therapy. And he said, really, I said yeah, yeah, give it a shot go ahead. I hate pimples, I hate hemorrhoids and hives. I hate funerals, I hate unsalted fries. I hate Brittney spears because she never returns any of the letters that I Write. But most of all, I hate my ex-girlfriend's new guy. Wouldn't mind if someone huge fell on his head and he died. Like a bus, or a truck, or a meteorite. A hippopotamus, a rhinoceros or even a pig if it was falling from a great height. I hate that guy    </segment1>
