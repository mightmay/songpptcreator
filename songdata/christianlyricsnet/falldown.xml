		<segment1>Fall down. Kiss the ground once again. This mire too often my heart's desire. Pick me up. Dust me off once again. This mire too often my heart's desire.</segment1>
		<segment2>I create my own shame. Put a muzzle on my mouth when I get so very anxious. So very anxious again.</segment2>
		<segment3>Better off if things were left unsaid. Tomorrow's sorrows waiting there once again. The silver pinholes of the night. refuse to sing their starry song tonight. Goodnight.goodnight.</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus 2X]. (We always go back, but not this time.)    </segment4>
