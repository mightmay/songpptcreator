		<segment1>From wanting to be loved. From wanting to be praised by all. From needing to be first. From finding all my worth in this world. From wanting to be seen. From constant worrying about myself. Deliver me. From validating words that only seem to serve a heart that's proud. And all my self esteem, dressed up in vanity and doubt. From wondering if I am relevant and liked, so God. Deliver me, deliver me. Show me what it all looks like. Scribbled on the pages of a human life. Riddled through the ages until we see the light. Breaking all the cages wide open. Every little prison. From fear of letting go. From fear of the unknown ahead. From being overlooked. And so misunderstood again. From fear of being judged. From rumors of a love that fails. Deliver me, deliver me. Show me what it all looks like. Scribbled on the pages of a human life. Riddled through the ages until we see the light. Breaking all the cages wide open. Every little prison. Let every man be more than I. Closer to the truth when I'm set aside. Mostly of no use, but when I fall I fly. Breaking all the cages wide open. All these little prisons. Show me what it all looks like. Scribbled on the pages of a human life. Riddled through the ages until we see the light. Breaking all the cages wide open. Every little prison    </segment1>
