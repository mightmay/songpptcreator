		<segment1>I feel Your presence when I'm on my knees. Asking for forgiveness, Lord, hear my cries and pleas.. I know You're there Lord, I know You care. I know You set me free, but I'm still scared. I know You're there, but I'm still scared.. Through prayer, Lord, I see the works You've done. In my life, even when the times get hard. You lift me up into Your light.. I know You're there, Lord, I know You care. I know You set me free, but I'm still scared    </segment1>
