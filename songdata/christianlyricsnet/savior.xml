		<segment1>Well, who is this angry man I see. In the mirror looking back at me?. Its a man whos tired, a man whos weak. And its a man who needs a Savior</segment1>
		<segment2>And who is this fearful little child. Crying out for home, lost in the wild?. With a lonely heart thats fading fast. Its a child who needs a Savior. A child who needs a Savior</segment2>
		<segment3>And what is this longing in my soul. That I get so scared and angry?. I need more than just a little help. I need someone who will save me. Come and save me. I need someone to save me. Who will save me?. Come and save me</segment3>
		<segment4>And who is this one nailed to a cross. Who would rather die than leave us lost?. Hes come to rescue us, come to set us free. Hallelujah, hallelujah. It is Christ the Lordour Savior.     </segment4>
