		<segment1>It's excruciating. I know you need to know where we stand. Is there harm in waiting?. Is this my only chance to take your hand?</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). I'm torn in two. By what I should. Or should not do. Torn, torn in two. Will you wait for me. If I run from you</segment2>
		<segment3>I really must confess. It feels like there's a war in me. I'm drawn to those who offer less. But is this really where I need to be?</segment3>
		<segment4>(Repeat Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge:). Over this I'm loosing rest. I can't bear to turn away. If I try a second guess. Oh, I gamble it away. I'm torn</segment5>
		<segment6>(Repeat Chorus)    </segment6>
