		<segment1>your poker face ain't fooling nobody nobody here. we've all felt the flame and shed those same tears. driving home to a one man hell still counting years still counting years. hey brother were all learning to love again </segment1>
		<segment2>cause that was the real you running through the fields of gold wide open. standing in places no picture contains. that was the real you windows down we could smell the mint fields crying. sing with the radio to song we can't name. that was the real you saying maybe i'm not to young to be a cowboy. hey brother we're all learning to love again. hey brother we're all learning to love again</segment2>
		<segment3>making up your bed that day on a foreign floor between foreign walls. thinking bout the words you'd say to a phone that never calls. feel the weight of your fathers ring and all those dreams and all those dreams. hey brother we're all learning to love again</segment3>
		<segment4>cause that was the real you running through the fields of gold wide open. standing in places no picture contains. that was the real you windows down we could smell the mint fields crying. sing with the radio to song we can't name. that was the real you saying maybe i'm not to young to be a cowboy. hey brother we're all learning to love again. hey brother we're all learning to love again</segment4>
		<segment5>i know you like i know my reflection. walking on the water cross and ocean of desire. everyone i know is looking for protection. trying to pull your hometown cross a telephone wire</segment5>
		<segment6>cause that was the real you standing there in the shape of your body. fear down know no love when we're all the same. that was the real you looking back across the water. tears falling like rain drops rippling against the shame. that was the real you singing hallelujah looking down a barrel. hey brother we're all learning to love again. hey brother we're all learning to love again    </segment6>
