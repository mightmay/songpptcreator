		<segment1>Just take it in stride. One breath and I think I feel free. All we can do is strive for the best thoughts, the best feelings, the &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; feeling. As a child, I believed these all came to me due to the process of living. Grab the wheel right now, and make this life yours. Walk with me. Leave your disgusting fever. Take this life - make it yours. Forgotten are the days of wandering pointlessly in my dreams. Carry me with your wings.    </segment1>
