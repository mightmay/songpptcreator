		<segment1>He heals the sick He saves the lost. and died for you in case you've forgot, man. He'll jump a building in a single bound. I once was lost but now I'm found. He needs no mask or cape or gown. all He needs is His holy crown. it's time for you to understand Jesus Christ the Original Superman. He'll be your hero in the end. He is that one true superfriend</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>Kryptonite can't slow him down nothin' can at all. He's always there for you. He'll pick you up if you should fall</segment3>
		<segment4>He came to earth in the flesh and. Performing miracles and died for man. A forty day fast is more than I could take. he did it for you and he did it for my sake. Ye of little faith he said to them raised his hand and all was calm again. It's time for you to understand. Jesus Christ the Original Superman</segment4>
		<segment5>up up and away He's saving souls in a new way. Just like Superman was there He's always there to save the day. he works through all of us. Through Him we have the power. It's time to unify so we can constantly devour. The devil and all of his games we need not be ashamed. Of anything we can do that we can glorify His name. Many names he has been given. Prince of Peace Son of Man. Here's one more for his list. the Original Superman    </segment5>
