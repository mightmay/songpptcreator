		<segment1>Lying idle in my room, telling my thoughts to the moon: Why do I always feel so unimportant?. To other egos my mind clings and inside these voices ring. That I'm just a carbon copy of everyone else</segment1>
		<segment2>And now I'm searching out my own identity. Something down inside telling me that I'm like no one else but me. But as of yet I still don't know. Who is this guy that I am and for his life what does he have to show?. Who am I?. What am I for?</segment2>
		<segment3>I wait for answers from the sky, the only audience I find. But no comfort finds my ears just silent mocking. And I know I was created but I just can't figure out why</segment3>
		<segment4>And now I'm searching out my own identity. Something down inside telling me that I'm like no one else but me. But as of yet I still don't know. Who is this guy that I am and for his life what does he have to show?. Who am I?. What am I for?</segment4>
		<segment5>Still searching. Who am I?. Some answers I don't ever find. I just want to know I have a place. Come from and return to dust, but I don't want to feel that useless. I want to see something in me that is unique. I just want to know. Who am I?. What am I for?    </segment5>
