		<segment1>It was in the way You came. As a lowly babe. That Your glory was displayed. And it was in the sacrifice. Of the purest life. It was in Your Fathers will obeyed </segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). The perfect Lamb that was slain. And theres the glory of Your name. No other one, no other way for me to see. You took my place, You are the way. And theres the glory of Your name. Yes, theres the glory of Your name </segment2>
		<segment3>It was in Your victory, risen for the world to see. That all who would believe could enter in. And it is in the passionate price. Now demanding all my life. And beating in the chambers of my heart </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). And there is nothing in this world. That could take the place of You. That could take the place of You my Jesus. And there is nothing in this life </segment4>
		<segment5>That could take the place of. One life, one love. One power to save us all. One hope, One truth. And one glory in it all. One glory in it all </segment5>
		<segment6>The perfect Lamb that was slain. And theres the glory of Your name. No other one, on other way for me to see. You took my place, You are the way. And theres the glory of Your name. Yes, theres the glory of Your name.     </segment6>
