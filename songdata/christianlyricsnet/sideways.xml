		<segment1>Last night my shadow ran from me. It bowed its head in shame. I can't bear my reflection. I can't even write my name</segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes I choose to. Forget about You. Sometimes I choose to. Ignore the truth</segment2>
		<segment3>Just like the man from chapter three. I tried to hide. From fleeting. Familiar. White light</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes I choose to. Forget about You. Sometimes I choose to. Ignore the truth</segment4>
		<segment5>How sweet the name. How sweet the face. That I long to touch. With dirty hands</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm seeing sideways. Because I've fallen down again. And it's so hard to find my way     </segment6>
