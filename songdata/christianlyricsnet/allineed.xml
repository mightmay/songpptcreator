		<segment1>As I sit here and think. About all that You've done. About how You gave me Your one and only Son. And I'm trying to fathom. All that You are, but so far, Lord. You're so beyond me. I fall down in reverence. And I fall down in fear. And I'm asking You, Lord, won't You please draw near. Won't You open my eyes. So that I can see. The way that You are working in me. All I need is Your love. To come and fill this heart of mine. My heart is a desert that has gone dry. And I need Your love to carry me bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. To carry me bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. To carry me bye. And I lay down my life. And I put it before You. All that I am is in Your hands. And I'm not going to question, why You're so faithful. Why that You give me the blessing that You have. Let the glory be known, let the glory be shown. Lift You up unto the throne. You are my God, You are my King. To You I give, I give You everything. All that I need is Your love, my God    </segment1>
