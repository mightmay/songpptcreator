		<segment1>I said that one day I'd be something and everyone would soon be proud of me. I'd sit and watch the day go by and think of all the things I'd like to be. So many of my dreams have gone and now. I'm left with only emptiness. There's nothing that can make me better, Nothing that can take away this pain</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: And I wonder what you'd say if I were gone. Would you cry? Did you even notice something wrong?</segment2>
		<segment3>I often wonder what's to live for. I just want this pain to go away. All I have are fading memories, pieces of my broken yesterday. They say every drop of blood meant something. And every ounce He shed was shed for me. Here I am, I'm waiting for You, crying out. I've fallen to my knees</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)    </segment4>
