		<segment1>I'll tell you now before I close my eyes. I want you to know how much you mean to me and though. I'll tell you now before I close my eyes. I hope I have shown in ways that you could see. Our love will always be. But now I</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. I promise you with every breath I take. For always forever be on time. I promise my love will never die. Tonight before I close my eyes, before I close my eyes. I promise you</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll tell you now before I say good night. I wanted to say a million times before and though. I tell you now, the words are hard to find. You move me inside, at times I've even cried. I never told you why, but now I promise you</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>So lay your head down now and trust me when I say. When we're as one we can't be separated. I promise you with every breath I take. For always forever be on time. I promise my love will never die. Tonight before I close my eyes. I promise you.     </segment5>
