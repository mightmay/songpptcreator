		<segment1>They grew tired of bread form heaven. And of Moses and of God. They longed to live the life of slavery once again. So they muttered and they grumbled. And they whimpered and they whined;. With each faithless word, sank deeper into sin</segment1>
		<segment2>He took the pen of pain once more. To write upon their hearts. The lesson they had been so slow to learn. But writing in the sand, the fiery serpents came to call. With a holy message and a bite that burned</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus:). Lift up the suffering symbol. And place it high upon a pole. Tell the children to look up and be made whole</segment3>
		<segment4>So Moses made a metal snake, And nailed it to a pole. Sent out the saving word so they would know. That the symbol of their suffering was now the focus of their faith. And with a faithful glance, the healing power would flow</segment4>
		<segment5>In time the brazen serpent became an idol in the land. And they left the living God to worship clay. When they forgot their suffering. Soon true faith had disappeared. So some idolize a brazen cross today</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus x4)</segment6>
		<segment7>Tell the children to look up and be made whole    </segment7>
