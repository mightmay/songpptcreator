		<segment1>Verse 1: Draw me close to YOU. Never let me go. I lay it all down again. To hear YOU say that I'm YOUR friend. YOU are my desire. No one else will do. No one else can take YOUR place. To feel the warmth of YOUR embrace. Help me find my way. Bring me back to YOU</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Oh Oh Oh. YOU're all I want. YOU're all I've ever needed. YOU're all I want. Help me know YOU are near</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh Oh Oh. YOU're all I want. YOU're all I've ever needed. YOU're all I want. Help me know YOU are near</segment3>
		<segment4>Help me know YOU are near. Help me know YOU are near</segment4>
		<segment5>Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord. To the cross where thou has died. Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord. To thine precious bleeding side    </segment5>
