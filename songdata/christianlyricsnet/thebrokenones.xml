		<segment1>Maggie came home one day with a raggedy, Raggedy Ann. She said &quot; Mama, look what I found in the neighbors garbage can.&quot;. It had a missing left arm, and a right button eye hanging by a thread. She carried it gently up to her room and laid it one her bed with her other dolls.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: She loves the broken ones, the ones that need a little patchin' up. She see's the diamond in the rough and makes it shine like new. It really doesn't take that much, a willing heart and a tender touch. If everybody loved like she does, there'd be a lot less broken ones.</segment2>
		<segment3>Twenty years later at a shelter on Eighteenth Avenue. A seventeen year old girl shows up all black and blue. with needle tracks in her left arm, almost too week to stand, She says,&quot;I'm lost an I need help&quot;, and Maggie takes her hand. And says, &quot;Come on in!&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: If you call her and angel, she'd be quick to say to you. She's just doing what the one who died for her would do</segment5>
		<segment6>Love the broken ones, the ones that need a little patchin' up. See the diamond in the rough and make it shine like new. it really doesn't take that much, a willing heart and a tender touch. If everybody loved like He does, there'd be a lot less broken ones. If everybody loved like He does, there's be a lot less broke ones.    </segment6>
