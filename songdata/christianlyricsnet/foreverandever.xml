		<segment1>Forever and ever we will sing your praises. Forever and ever we will glorify your name. Above all names every name. Merciful Lord Jesus. You took the cross to free us. Conquered death and sin</segment1>
		<segment2>In a battle they could never win. For you are the first the last. Lord of future Lord of past. You reign in glory as the king. You are worthy so worthy. You reign in glory as the king. Receive the praise we sing    </segment2>
