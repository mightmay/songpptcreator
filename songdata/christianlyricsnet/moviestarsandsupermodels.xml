		<segment1>How come my life ain't like this movie?. I should try to look some more like that. And maybe then I could be a movie star, And maybe then you'd always laugh at my jokes. Cuz life would be just like this movie, and I would never feel alone. In fact, all the problems that I have would go away, and I would forget how to feel sad.</segment1>
		<segment2>Cuz this silver screen that I'm looking at. is making me a little bored of my life cuz. its not what I'm looking at, Cuz this has so much more of excitement, thrills, and adventurous things in every life. And a sparkle is the reflection in my eye.</segment2>
		<segment3>Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba. If only the shows were as real as the glows. then we'd never see the same, but I guess we'll never know. Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba. Well they showed it, and we bought it. So you see it's not just me, its sweet - It's in the movie.</segment3>
		<segment4>She wants a better body and some super model moves. Cuz in her head she's always been the ugly one. Well hey, we think we're ugle too. And it's true that we will never know. all of the things that she could have known. Well I wonder when she thought it was that she would win?. Cuz man she got so thin.</segment4>
		<segment5>Every now and then she would start to pretend like she was a star. and in the movies they're in. But it's strange cuz it seems. there's never happy endings. Is it make believe?</segment5>
		<segment6>Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba. If only the shows were as real as the glows. then we'd never see the same, but I guess we'll never know. Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba. Well they showed it, and we bought it. So you see it's not just me, its sweet - It's in the movie.    </segment6>
