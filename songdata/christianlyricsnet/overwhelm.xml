		<segment1>This is an invitation. To overwhelm my heart. I'm asking You to meet me. I'm waiting here to start</segment1>
		<segment2>My soul is like a desert. Thirsty for Your rain. So open up the Heavens. And fill me up again. I am ready for my life to be consumed</segment2>
		<segment3>Father, here I am. Overwhelm, overwhelm. Only Your love can. Overwhelm, overwhelm. Let Your spirit fall. Overtake it all. Overwhelm, overwhelm. Overwhelm, overwhelm me</segment3>
		<segment4>Desperate for Your presence. I long for You alone. So dwell within me, Jesus. This temple is Your home. I am ready for this life to be consumed    </segment4>
