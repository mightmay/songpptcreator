		<segment1>In this time of need. This time of peril. This time when the helpless seek. When so many search for some light of hope. And they begin to consider this God of whom they've been told. The wolves come out to play. To deceive. And turn men's hearts away. Under guise of sheep with such beautiful smiles. They appear to be of God, yet all the wile they..</segment1>
		<segment2>Lead them straight to hell</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't touch me.. You've got blood on your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>Time will come, you will see. You're over</segment4>
		<segment5>Playing on their need. The need to live</segment5>
		<segment6>To live pure and free. You mix a little lies with a lot of truth. You bait their trust and then they follow you. You get them believing and following lies. Then they see your deceit all in the name of Christ. They look into my eyes..they can't understand</segment6>
		<segment7>When they hear you call me &quot;brother&quot; and see you shake my hand</segment7>
		<segment8>They.. Curse his name 'cause of you..</segment8>
		<segment9>Stealing their hope for peace. A fellowship of thieves. Hands dipped in the blood of children. Exposed while seeking peace. A fellowship of thieves. Causing more destruction than those. Who don't claim to believe. This fellowship of thieves. Watch for the wolves, be wary. That you are not deceived    </segment9>
