		<segment1>YOURE IN MY HEART</segment1>
		<segment2>You have me by the heart. Wrapped around Your finger sweet. Ive tasted of Your love. Now all I want is more of You. Youre in my heart. All the time. I live cause You live in me. Youre in my world. Im complete. I live cause You live in me </segment2>
		<segment3>No other love like this. On my knees I kiss Your feet. One moment I cant endure. If Youre not near. If Youre not near </segment3>
		<segment4>I love You for all that You are. Not for the way that You give. Every day I live I am Yours. Every day I live.     </segment4>
