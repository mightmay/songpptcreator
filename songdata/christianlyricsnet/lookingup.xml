		<segment1>Things are looking up, oh, finally. I thought I'd never see the day when you smile at me. We always pull through, oh, when we try. I'm always wrong but you're never right. Oh, you're never right</segment1>
		<segment2>Honestly, can you believe we crossed. The world while it's asleep?. I'd never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this. And it's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh. It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for</segment2>
		<segment3>Could have given up so easily. I was a few cheap shots away from the end of me. Taken for granted, 'most everything. That I would have died for just yesterday, just yesterday</segment3>
		<segment4>Honestly, can you believe we crossed. The world while it's asleep?. I'd never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this. And it's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh. It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for</segment4>
		<segment5>God knows the world doesn't need another band. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh. But what a waste it would've been. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh</segment5>
		<segment6>I can't believe we almost have give up. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh. We're just getting started. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh</segment6>
		<segment7>Honestly, can you believe we crossed. The world while it's asleep?. I'd never trade it in 'cause I've always wanted this. And it's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh. It's not a dream anymore, no, oh. It's not a dream anymore, no, oh, oh, oh. It's not a dream anymore, it's worth fighting for</segment7>
		<segment8>I can't believe we almost have give up. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh. We're just getting started. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh</segment8>
		<segment9>I can't believe we almost have give up. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh. We're just getting started, we're just getting started.     </segment9>
