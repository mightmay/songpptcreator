		<segment1>Feeling the glass to tell how cold it's outside the car. Swerving aside from street to sea, I can't see the stars</segment1>
		<segment2>All is cold and all is dark, all is cold and all is dark. No more star crossed tears. He is drawing near</segment2>
		<segment3>Under the trees from moonlit fears, we circle the start. Moving the leaves to flutter free, it's after the heart</segment3>
		<segment4>All is cold and all is dark, all is cold and all is dark. No more star crossed tears. He is drawing near. Now salvation sings. Life that Jesus brings</segment4>
		<segment5>Now reach out to be lost inside. No more star crossed tears. He is drawing near    </segment5>
