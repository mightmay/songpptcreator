		<segment1>In the morning as I wake. I pray my eyes do see. On this narrow road I walk. You have made a path for me. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You were moving all the while. In sickness and in doubt. Or questions that may raise. You claimed victory on the cross. And You filled my lungs with praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You were moving all the while. On a dark and silent night. Above Your beauty shines. And Your peace shall fill the earth. By Your love we are refined. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You were moving all the while. Through all the bitter storms. Whatever comes our way. You will guide this vessel home. To live for all my days. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You were moving all the while. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You were moving all the while. You were moving all the while    </segment1>
