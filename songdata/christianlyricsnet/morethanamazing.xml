		<segment1>You're the one who walked on water. And You calmed the raging seas. You command the highest mountains. To fall upon their knees. You're the one who welcomed sinners. And You opened blinded eyes. You restored the brokenhearted. And You brought the dead to life</segment1>
		<segment2>Forgetting all our sins. You remember all Your promises</segment2>
		<segment3>You are amazing. More than amazing. Forever our God. You're more than enough. You are amazing</segment3>
		<segment4>With authority You've spoken. And You've set the captive free. You're the King who came to serve. And You're the God who washed our feet. You're the one who took our burdens. And You bled upon the cross. In your kindness and Your mercy. You became the way for us</segment4>
		<segment5>Forgetting all our sins. You remember all Your promises</segment5>
		<segment6>You are amazing. More than amazing. Forever our God. You're more than enough. You are amazing. More than amazing. Forever our God. You're more than enough</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh how marvelous. Oh how wonderful. Oh how glorious. You are amazing. Oh how marvelous. Oh how wonderful. Oh how glorious You are</segment7>
		<segment8>You are amazing. More than amazing. Forever our God. You're more than enough    </segment8>
