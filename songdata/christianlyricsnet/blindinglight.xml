		<segment1>Hey boy, don't believe them.  Their old lies never could come true.  Hey boy, don't believe them.  Everything that they told you to.  Hey boy, don't believe them.  We're the nation that eats our youth.  Hey boy, don't believe them.  None of us are bulletproof.  Yeah</segment1>
		<segment2> Deep down there's a boy inside.  Asleep, waiting for the sun to rise.  Wake up, wake up</segment2>
		<segment3> Still looking for the blinding light.  Still looking for the reason why.  Still looking for the sun to shine.  Take me higher and higher.  All my life I've been living in the darkest night.  Still looking for the blinding light.  To take me higher and higher</segment3>
		<segment4> Hey girl, be yourself now.  Don't believe what they told you to.  Hey girl, be yourself now.  Your skin's more than a pin-up suit.  Hey girl, don't conform now.  No one else's got soul like you.  Hey girl, you're a strong one.  But none of us are bulletproof.  Yeah</segment4>
		<segment5> Deep down there's a hope inside.  You got wings but you're scared to fly.  Wake up, wake up</segment5>
		<segment6> Still looking for the blinding light.  Still looking for the reason why.  Still looking for the sun to shine.  Take me higher and higher.  All my life I've been living in the darkest night.  Still looking for the sun to shine.  Take me higher and higher</segment6>
		<segment7> Deep down there's a hope inside.  Brighter than the fears in my mind.  I keep looking for the blinding light.  It's a hope that keeps me alive.  Wake up, wake up</segment7>
		<segment8> Keep looking for the blinding light.  Keep looking for the reason why.  Keep looking for the sun to shine.  Take me higher and higher.  All my life I've been living in the darkest night.  Still looking for the sun to rise.  To take me higher and higher</segment8>
		<segment9> Blinding light, the blinding light.  Yeah I've been waiting all my life.  To take me higher and higher.  Blinding light, you're the vision that gives me sight.  All the blinding light, take me higher and higher    </segment9>
