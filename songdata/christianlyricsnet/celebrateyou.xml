		<segment1>I'm no stranger to your gentle reminders. That the world does not revolve around me. But no sooner have you spoken the words. Than your love comes once again to surround me. And every time I look in your eyes. I see the reflections of myself. But this time I want to look deeper. And see you and nobody else</segment1>
		<segment2>So, tell me what you think, and tell me what you feel. I want to hear the thunder I'm so quick to steal. Listen to the dreams you're dreaming and celebrate you. Let me show you what a treasure you are. A priceless gift from heaven to this thankful heart. I want to take this lifetime to celebrate you. I want to celebrate you</segment2>
		<segment3>I have heard you say so many times. How you're sorry you're not everything you should be. So let me tell you this one more time. There's no way you could be any more precious to me. But I know that lovely flowers and phrases. Are not what you need the most from me. You're longing for someone to listen. And that's what I want to learn how to be</segment3>
		<segment4>So, tell me what you think, and tell me what you feel. I want to hear the thunder I'm so quick to steal. Listen to the dreams you're dreaming and celebrate you. Let me show you what a treasure you are. A priceless gift from heaven to this thankful heart. I want to take this lifetime to celebrate you. I want to celebrate you.     </segment4>
