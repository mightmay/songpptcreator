		<segment1>Ever since the day that I was made Ive been deciding the end. And I was made of wood and stone that wont diminish or bend. So when the heavy hand of death is here to take me away. Ill be the solid grip of time, forever holding my stay. Nobody ever made a force that took a beating like me. I call the earth and every scum to come and try to fight me. Cus when I made the choice to live beyond the dirt that we tread. I felt the curse of mortal limit fall before it was said</segment1>
		<segment2>Pre-chorus: When this season ends</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: One final heart-break. And blinding lights will guide our way. Free us our blind state. They will call us by our name. Undying</segment3>
		<segment4>Tearing through these days I find the tolerance to strive and push on. I know what lies beyond this life for me is already won. No one can take away the blood that covers over my fall. Without the blood of perfect life I know Im nothing at all. So now I reign forever hallowed in eternitys hand. No man can shake me from the everlasting ground that I stand</segment4>
		<segment5>(Pre-chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>We are the ones who will still remain when all is laid to waste. We are the ones who, when angels cry, will see them face to face. We are the ones</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)</segment8>
		<segment9>. .     </segment9>
