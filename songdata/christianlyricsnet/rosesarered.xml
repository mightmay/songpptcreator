		<segment1>I keep telling myself I don't need anybody. I dont need anybody else. But I guess thats not true I'm always blue. And thats because I don't have you. I fantasize then realize it's make believe. I am no good why do I try? Can't I see?. You're in your world I'm in mine but I don't care. I'm not quite sure what to think I know its there. Well it might be good and it might be bad. And it might be what I was waiting for. Well yoou're the greatest thing since the telephone. so call me up when you're alone    </segment1>
