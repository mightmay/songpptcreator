		<segment1>I.. You're never gonna hear what I say 'til I stand up and say what you want me to, And I'm gonna stand right in your way, pray God will have mercy on all of you, You wanna know what's inside of me, You wanna know what we're all about, You keep it up and you'll be finding out.</segment1>
		<segment2>No way, you're not stopping us, It's here in our hearts, No way your fighting words will tear us apart.</segment2>
		<segment3>I.. Think it's time you started watching your mouth, 'cause God never called us to be walked on, And you're never gonna figure us out, If you know what is best, you'll leave us alone, You wanna know what's inside of me, You wanna know what we're all about, You keep it up and you'll be finding out.</segment3>
		<segment4>No way, you're not stopping us, It's here in our hearts, No way your fighting words will tear us apart, There's no way, you're not stopping us, It's here in our hearts, No way your fighting words will tear us apart.</segment4>
		<segment5>There's no way, you're not stopping us, It's here in our hearts, No way your fighting words will tear us apart, There's no way, you're not stopping us, It's here in our hearts, No way your fighting words will tear us apart.    </segment5>
