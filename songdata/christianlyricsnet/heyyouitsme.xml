		<segment1>Deb, you really are the love of. My life.</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey you. Things to do. Live the life for faith and family. It's tough. With all that stuff. Filling your head. We know. The undertow. Could get us so we don't remember, but. Lest we ever. Lest we ever forget</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey you, it's me. True lovers are we. Children under the sun. Two spirits in the name of one</segment3>
		<segment4>Hey me. Got to be. Places to go and people there to see. No space. For back to base. And no time at all. We talk. Walk the walk. Run the race. And climb the ladder, but. If we ever. If we ever should fall</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes the smoke clears. And I see things how they are. I see how we have come so far    </segment5>
