		<segment1>What goes around, comes around. And I cant breathe. What holds me up is what holds me down. And I am more unstable than I seem</segment1>
		<segment2>My heart is bare. Theres not much there</segment2>
		<segment3>But I believe youve given me. More than I could know. But I know this. You are good</segment3>
		<segment4>Ive fought the fight against myself. And Ive lost the fight again. My bodys broke from falling down. Just give me one more chance this time Ill win</segment4>
		<segment5>My heart is bare. But I know that youre there</segment5>
		<segment6>My eyes are weak I can barely see. A glimmer of your gold but its enough to know. You are good</segment6>
		<segment7>And through it all youve given me. A peace that overflows. Oh how I know. That you are good</segment7>
		<segment8>So good to me. You are good.     </segment8>
