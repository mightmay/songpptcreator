		<segment1>At daybreak I wait for You. Crush softly, come. With the brilliance and weight of Jupiter. You weaken me as with wounds</segment1>
		<segment2>It's always enough. To sound the deeps Numinous. By falling under. It's always enough. To run Your way Numinous. And I will follow</segment2>
		<segment3>At sundown I wait for You. Speak softly, come. Dying now with the way. That Your voice and music. Are the same to me</segment3>
		<segment4>It's always enough. To sound the deeps Numinous. By falling under. It's always enough. To run Your way Numinous. And I will follow</segment4>
		<segment5>One day's enough. To know all fullness. I'll run Your way. You will enlarge my heart. Though You slay me. I will hope in You through all. Forgive the best of what we do and are. Just God, forgive</segment5>
		<segment6>It's always enough. To sound the deeps Numinous. By falling under. It's always enough. To run Your way Numinous. And I will follow.     </segment6>
