		<segment1>He made the night, He made the day. Spread the earth upon the water. Made the heavens and the rain. Look at the sky. See it's design</segment1>
		<segment2>The very same creator is the one who gave us life. What is man that He's mindful of us?. We're merely clay in His hands. What am I that He loves me so much He would die. All that I can say is..</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: It's God, truly God. Can you see, can you hear, can you touch, can you feel. It's God, truly God. I can't explain any other way cuz it's God</segment3>
		<segment4>Inside us all there is a void. All mankind is searching for the one who fills the soul. In Him there's hope, in Him there's life. The world cries for a savior that's right before their eyes. What is man that He takes us in as His children to be His own. And what are we that He wants to be our Father. All that I can say is..</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord I praise You for Your endless love. Your boundless grace. I stand here amazed..</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS    </segment7>
