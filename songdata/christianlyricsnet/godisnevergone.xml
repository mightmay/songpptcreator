		<segment1>A boulevard I'd never choose. I walked a strange avenue. All my dreams were inside- out. I heard a whisper &quot; needed a shout</segment1>
		<segment2>Everything around me has been trying my faith. But now I know it's trying to say</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). God is never gone. He is by your side. In the middle of nowhere. Barely hanging on. It'll be all right. He's already there. You'll never be alone. There's nowhere you can go. God has never gone</segment3>
		<segment4>A million miles from where I was. Faithful is as faithful does. So like a siren cuts the dark. I will scream to the lonely hearts</segment4>
		<segment5>Even in the solitude of loosing your way. You don't have to be so afraid</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>(Bridge). In your wildest dreams. In your painful prayers. Everywhere between. Even there</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus).     </segment8>
