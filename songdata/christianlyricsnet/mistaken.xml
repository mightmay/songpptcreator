		<segment1>I shouldn't have to tell you who I am. Cause who I am should be speaking for itself. Cause if I am who I, I want to be. Then who you see won't even be me. Oh the more and more I disappear. THe more and more He becomes clear</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Til everyone I talk to hears His voice. And everything I touch feels the warmth of His hand. Til everyone I meet. Sees Jesus in me. This is all I wanna be. I wanna be mistaken. For Jesus. Oh I wanna be mistaken</segment2>
		<segment3>Do they only see who we are. When who we are should be pointing them to Christ. Cause we are who He chose to use. To spread the news. Of the way the truth and the life. Oh I want all I am to die. So all He is can come alive</segment3>
		<segment4>Til everyone I talk to heart His voice. And everything I touch feels the warmth of His hand. Til everyone I meet. Sees Jesus in me. This is all I wanna be. I wanna be mistaken. For Jesus. Oh I wanna be. Oh I need to be mistaken. For You. Lord i wanna be mistaken. Mistaken</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE: May He touch with my hands. See through my eyes. May He speak through my lips. Live through my life</segment5>
		<segment6>I want Him to. I want Him to live    </segment6>
