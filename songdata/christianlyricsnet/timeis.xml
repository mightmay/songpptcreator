		<segment1>[It's, it's too short, it's too short]. [I have lots of time]. [They say time waits for no man]. [All the time]. [Waisted time, waisted time]. [Wait a minute]. [This'll just take a little time]. [Time out!]</segment1>

		<segment5>You got a gift and you best start using it. Cause if you don't you're gonna wind up losing it. Just like the brother who buried it deep. The task was simple but the price was steep.

		<segment7>Right now is the time that we gotta get with it. The gift that He's given ain't just an exhibit. But a tool that He's given us to use for His sake. And just as He's given He can surely take. The signs of the times are dropping like flies. The cries of the people around us imply. They're lookin' for an answer that we already know. But time is definitely on the go</segment7>

		<segment10>Time is tickin' away, time is tickin'. Time is tickin' away, time is tickin'. You got a gift and you best start using it. Cause if you don't you're gonna wind up losing it. Get busy like a school boy makin' an &quot;A&quot;. Cause time my brother is tickin' away</segment10>
		<segment11>Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away. Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away. Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away. Time is tickin' away, tick tick tickin' away</segment11>
		<segment12>Time is tickin', it keeps on tickin'. Time is tickin' away (6x)</segment12>
