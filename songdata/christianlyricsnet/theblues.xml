		<segment1>Is this the New Year or just another night?. Is this the new fear or just another fright?. Is this the new tear or just another desperation?</segment1>
		<segment2>Is this the finger or just another fist?. Is this the kingdom or just a hit n' miss?. A misdirection, most in all this desperation</segment2>
		<segment3>Is this what they call freedom?. Is this what you call pain?. Is this what they call discontented fame?</segment3>
		<segment4>It'll be a day like this one. When the world caves in. When the world caves in. When the world caves in</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm singing this one like a broken piece of glass. From broken arms an' broken noses in the back. Is this the New Year or just another desperation?</segment5>
		<segment6>You're pushing till you're shoving. You bend until you break. Till you stand on the broken fields where our fathers lay</segment6>
		<segment7>It'll be a day like this one. When the world caves in. When the world caves in. When the world caves in. When the world caves in. When the world caves in. When the world caves in</segment7>
		<segment8>There's nothing here worth saving, Is no one here at all?. Is there any net left that could break our fall?</segment8>
		<segment9>It'll be a day like this one. When the sky falls down and the hungry and poor and deserted are found. Are you discontented? Have you been pushing hard?. Have you been through and down this broken house of cards?</segment9>
		<segment10>It'll be a day like this one. When the world caves in. When the world caves in. When the world caves in</segment10>
		<segment11>Is there nothing left now?. Nothing left to sing. Are there any left who haven't kissed the enemy?. Is this the New Year or just another desperation?</segment11>
		<segment12>Just as I could find you, do the wicked never lose?. Is there any honest song to sing besides these blues?</segment12>
		<segment13>And nothing is okay. Till the world caves in. Till the world caves in. Till the world caves in. Till the world caves in. Till the world caves in. Until the world caves in. Until the world caves in. Until the world caves in. Until the world caves in. Until the world caves in. Until the world caves in    </segment13>
