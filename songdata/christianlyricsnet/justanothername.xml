		<segment1>these clouds around you break your fall. as you came crashing to the ground. did you learn anything at all. you climb back up to come back down</segment1>
		<segment2>everybody knows your name. but they don't know who you are. but to them it's just the same. yeah you're just another name</segment2>
		<segment3>she said fame will bring you down. at least that's what she used to say. then I handed her another crown. she said it would never be this way</segment3>
		<segment4>everybody knows your name. but they don't know who you are. but to them it's just the same. yeah you're just another name. just another name</segment4>
		<segment5>yesterday she was a little girl. pretending she was queen yeah. didn't know it'd change the world. didn't know what this should mean. which mask will you wear today. how about the one with the pretty smile. to you it's just another day. in a life you haven't lived in quite awhile</segment5>
		<segment6>everybody knows your name. but they don't know who you are. but to them it's just a game. and I think it's gone too far. everybody knows your name. but they don't know who you are. you've got the most familiar face. but your just another name. just another name. just another name    </segment6>
