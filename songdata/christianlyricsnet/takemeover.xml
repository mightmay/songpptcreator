	<english>
		<segment1>Just to rest in your arms. Close enough to hear your heart. Just to kneel at your feet. Where everything fades away and I sing</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, Jesus, take me over now. I surrender. Everything I have, I lay it down. All of me</segment2>
		<segment3>With just a glimpse of your face. All my fears melt away. Lost within your embrace. IÂ’m pouring out all my admiration    </segment3>
