		<segment1>[Verse 1:]. My life is a life for your cause. My will laid aside for your call. And reserved all the depth Of my heart. Only for You</segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse 2:]. I'm caught in the rhythms of grace. They overcome all of my ways. We align in each step that we take. To live for Your glory</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. There's none beside You God. There's none beside You God</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 3:]. You're there in dark of the night. While holding the sun and its light. Through the triumph and trials alike. There's no one beside You</segment4>
		<segment5>[Verse 4:]. Your voice calls the stars by their name. You whisper them all to their place. To testify of Your wonder and praise. Both now and forever</segment5>
		<segment6>[Bridge:]. I live my life to shine Your light. 'Cause there is none beside You God</segment6>
		<segment7>No eye has seen. No ear has heard. The depths of Your love Lord. No mind can fathom. The love You deserve. How great You are.     </segment7>
