		<segment1>Some days I just want to scream everything that I believe in. Oh, theres a love that will quench your soul and show you what life is. But then I turn in fear and doubt that someone will hear me. That they will all just laugh in face and call me crazy</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh whyd I back down. Ive got to share my heart. Turn this world around</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Say, what you believe. Come on and shout it out loud. Say, what you believe. Say, what you believe. Come on and live it out loud. Say, what you believe</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2. Some say that Im wasting my time with the one love I believe in. I cant deny that this feeling inside has got me seein. Eternity comes to those who believe when this world starts fadin. So go ahead and laugh in my face and call me crazy</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh I wont back down. Im gonna share my heart. Turn this world around</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. Everybody come and rise up together. Take a stand, dont be afraid of the pressure. And with one voice were gonna cry out forever. Every mother father sister brother. Reach out for each other cmon    </segment6>
