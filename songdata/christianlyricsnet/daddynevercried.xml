		<segment1>Daddy never cried. He just turned away. Never showed the side. That was soft as clay. What a weak reply. You live inside a blanket of shame</segment1>
		<segment2>Why would you need a gift of pardoning. Until your sin becomes your own. Soon comes inevitable reckoning. Then you'll understand. Just how much true love can change a man</segment2>
		<segment3>Daddy never cried. Will not work today. Put your pride aside. We all need grace. Somewhere deep inside. What you love is what you need to hate</segment3>
		<segment4>When will you stop blaming somebody else. You make decisions on your own. You choose to leave the truth for nonsense. Do you understand. Just how much the truth can change a man    </segment4>
