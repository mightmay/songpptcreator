		<segment1>Tears are falling. From someone's eyes. Hearts are breaking, yeah. Somewhere tonight. So many people are hurting. And can't see past their pain. But there's still healing in Jesus name</segment1>
		<segment2>Tears are falling. As someone cries. Hearts are breaking. Somewhere tonight. So alone. Seems like no one cares. But this promise was made to you, Jesus will always be there</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: So hold on to Jesus. With all your might. And you will find hope in Him. Somewhere tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>Tears are falling. From someone's eyes. Hearts are breaking, yeah. Somewhere tonight. Life is a vapor. It's here and then it's gone. But our hope rests in this truth this world is not our home</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS: So hold on to Jesus. With all your might. And you, you will find hope in Him. Somewhere tonight</segment5>
		<segment6>Somewhere. Hold on. Somewhere. Tears are being wiped away. From someone's eyes. And hearts are being mended. Somewhere tonight    </segment6>
