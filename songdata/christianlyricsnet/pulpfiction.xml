		<segment1>laying on the floor. i've been here once before. and i'm not proud of it. misery comes today. it's coming back my way. and i want it to leave me </segment1>
		<segment2>doubtful you are the people. where your anger run your sleep. fate of those whos feet are slipping. or to those whos eyes. or to those whos eyes have seen </segment2>
		<segment3>to him the strength belongs. the weak attempt his arms. and show me my offence. so look away from me. becuase i can hardly see. im hiding nothing </segment3>
		<segment4>doubtful you are the people. where your anger run your sleep. fate of those whos feet are slipping. or to those whos eyes. or to those whos eyes have seen </segment4>
		<segment5>doubtful you are the people. when your anger run your sleep. fate of those whos feet are slipping. or to those whos eyes. or to those whos eyes have seen</segment5>
		<segment6>.     </segment6>
