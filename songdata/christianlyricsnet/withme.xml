		<segment1>I open my mouth and You speak for me. You move the mountains and roll back the sea</segment1>
		<segment2>I will not afraid. I will never be ashamed. For You are with me. You are with me</segment2>
		<segment3>I've seen enough to know. That You're my only hope. I don't want to go. If You're not with me</segment3>
		<segment4>We open our hands and You reach for us. You are the motion of the universe    </segment4>
