		<segment1>The winds came by and they carried me away. At least that's what your momma said she'd say. Of course I knew that you would never believe. But baby sometimes even big girls are allowed to weep. Oh Brenda Gene my peanut butter queen. Innocent and bright don't think of me as mean. Sweet Brenda Gene for all you haven't seen. You know I hate to leave you fatherless at fourteen. I'm sure you think I've left you alone. Torn apart our happy home. But love, I never planned it this way. Never this soon and never this day. (Bridge). Heaven's quite a sight to see I'm sure you'll be here too. And though it's beautiful my dear it can't compare to you    </segment1>
