		<segment1>We lit the match, dropped it and waited. Just to see how beautiful, and painful it could be. It's funny how clear, your eyes get from crying. It's funny how clean, your life gets from dying.</segment1>
		<segment2>You know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. all we want is shelter. from the times that bring us down. You know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. just to be protected. from the doubt that's in our heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Been at the bottom, soared to the sun. Just to see how beautiful. and painful it could be. Wings that were ours, broken from trying. Wings that were ours, melted from flying</segment3>
		<segment4>You know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. all we want is shelter. from the times that bring us down. You know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. just to be protected. from the doubt that's in our heart</segment4>
		<segment5>You know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. all we want is shelter. from the times that bring us down. You know your sleeves are long, waiting on an answer. just to be protected. from the doubt that's in our heart.     </segment5>
