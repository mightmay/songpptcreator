		<segment1>Lilly of the valley, let your sweet aroma fill my life. Rose of Sharon show me, how to grow in beauty in Gods sight. Fairest of ten thousand, make me a reflection of your light. Daystar shine down on me, let your love shine through me in the night</segment1>
		<segment2>Lead me Lord Ill follow, anywhere you open up the door. Let your words speak to me, show me what Ive never seen before. Lord I loaned to be your witness, cause you can take whats wrong and make it right. Daystar shine down on me, let your love shine through me in the night</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord I see your world thats dying, wounded by the master of deceit. Grouping in the darkness, haunted by the years of past defeat. But when I see you standing near me Lord, shining with compassion in your eyes. I pray Jesus shine down on me, let your love shine through me in the night</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh Yes. Lead me Lord Ill follow, anywhere you open up the door. Let your words speak to me, show me what Ive never seen before. Lord I loaned to be your witness, cause you can take whats wrong and make it right. Daystar shine down on me, let your love shine through me in the night</segment4>
		<segment5>Yes, Daystar shine down on me, oh, oh, yes Daystar shine down on me oh, oh, Jesus shine down on me, let your love shine through me in the night (repeat 2 times)    </segment5>
