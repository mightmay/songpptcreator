		<segment1>What is our reason for running away in these uncertain times?. Once we have said all that there is to say, what more can we find?. Our idols, an endless array of excess fill us with sinful pride. Never imagining what we have lost chasing this empty life. Lies that only lead us astray!. What is our reason for running away in these uncertain times?. The remnants of all that we have wasted away, scattered and left behind. Lies that, lies that, only lead us astray!    </segment1>
