		<segment1>Its been a long long time since. Since Ive spent some time with you. Im seeing lonely moments. Seeing lonely truths. A distant tone has come to me. And now I find Im missing. That old familiar tune. A song your heart has played me. A rhythm I once new</segment1>
		<segment2>So lay me down at your feet. And sing the words that you know I need</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause Im here I want to hear your heartbeat. Please put your love around me. And just let me know. That youre here. Now Im an arms reach from you. From the lover of my soul</segment3>
		<segment4>And so I'll fight the current. Ill fight the undertow. Help me swim away from. Where my weakness grows.     </segment4>
