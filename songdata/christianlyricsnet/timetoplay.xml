		<segment1>It's time to rock it's time to play so jump around if you feel the same way. We're gonna hit you with a new style. so listen up cause we're gonna be here awhile. So take time to give us a chance and take your time for sing and dance. Take a break from the norm we've done for so long. let's praise Jesus Christ with a new kind of song</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>It's a time of celebration, for every boy and every girl. He's a God of revelation for everyone around the world</segment3>
		<segment4>It's time to rock, it's time to play. so throw your hands up if you feel the same way. Let the sound of the song penetrate your head. and take a moment to realize Jesus Christ has bled. for you and me on a cross on top of Calvary. He gave His life for me, He set His people free. Knowin He has done this now for so long. let's praise Jesus Christ with a new kinda song    </segment4>
