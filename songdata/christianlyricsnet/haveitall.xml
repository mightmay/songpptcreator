		<segment1>Counting down, expecting. Latest, greatest. Newest model maybe, hope. Wishing, hoping, praying. To outdo the Joneses</segment1>
		<segment2>Squalor, impulse, crowding. Tis the season. Do the days turn just for these?. Savior born in manger. Please forgive us born in the inn</segment2>
		<segment3>Heaven tomorrow. Heaven, my chance to have it all</segment3>
		<segment4>See all my glimmering weakness. Here's my world, come on. Will You come in?. Brought to my knees. Child I'll play for You</segment4>
		<segment5>Child enters in this world. It's broken. Angels sing and men sleep the night. Though it's brazen and defiant. Please be born in my heart</segment5>
		<segment6>Heaven tomorrow. Heaven, skies open. Pour out hope</segment6>
		<segment7>See all my glimmering weakness. Here's my world, come on. Will You come in?. Brought to my knees. Child I'll play for You </segment7>
