		<segment1>Ill take you out to dinner tonight while the moon is bright. We can blur out all our visitors who dont really give. Us a sign of attention anyways. We can piece together crumbles of napkin to map our getaway. And ride out on our dinner plates across the Choctawhatchee Bay </segment1>
		<segment2>Speak to me in mysteries. Speak to me in all the words Ive heard a thousand times. Just speak to me with your voice and Ill follow. Anytime, anytime.     </segment2>
