		<segment1>Conversation was meant to be. Emancipation of myself and pain inside of me. Sometimes I wonder where I'd be without you God. There'd be a big old hole inside of me. I sit and I wait for you.. Time to take place. Perfect day that shines even brighter unto you. Perfect day that shines even brighter all because of you.</segment1>
		<segment2>When you're here, you empower me. Come inside and control me.    </segment2>
