		<segment1>I settle down a twisted up frown. Disguised as a smile, well, you would have never known. I had it all, but not what I wanted. 'Cause hope for me was a place uncharted and overgrown</segment1>
		<segment2>You'd make your way in. I'd resist you just like this. You can't tell me to feel. The truth never set me free. So I did it myself</segment2>
		<segment3>You can't be too careful anymore. When all that is waiting for you. Won't come any closer. You've got to reach out a little more. More, more, more, more</segment3>
		<segment4>Open your eyes like I open mine. It's only the real world, life you will never know. Shifting your way to throw off the pain. Well, you can ignore it, but only for so long</segment4>
		<segment5>You look like I did. You resist me just like this. You can't tell me to heal. And it hurts remembering. How it felt to shut down</segment5>
		<segment6>Can't be too careful anymore. When all that is waiting for you. Won't come any closer. You've got to reach out a little more. More, more, more, more</segment6>
		<segment7>The truth never set me free. The truth never set me free. The truth never set me free. So I'll do it myself</segment7>
		<segment8>You can't be too careful anymore. When all that is waiting for you. Won't come any closer. You've got to reach out</segment8>
		<segment9>Can't be too careful anymore. When all that is waiting for you. You won't come any closer. You've got to reach out more. More, more, more, more    </segment9>
