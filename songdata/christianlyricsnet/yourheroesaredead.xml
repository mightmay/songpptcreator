		<segment1>There's something coming. And its coming for you. The mob is restless. Looking for something new. You lead us here. With an eternal promise. The gallows are calling. For you to pay for this</segment1>
		<segment2>Now that we're left here on our own. There is nowhere left to turn. Who will see me through?</segment2>
		<segment3>Your heroes are dead. They were all in you head. When nothing is left we'll start again</segment3>
		<segment4>What fitting ends. To our fearless fathers. The cost of treason. Isn't paid in dollars. With nothing left. There is nothing to lose. We'll watch the city gates. Falling all around you    </segment4>
