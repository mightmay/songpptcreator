		<segment1>In the quiet, in the stillness. I know that You are God. In the secret of Your presence. I know there I am restored</segment1>
		<segment2>When You call I won't refuse. Each new day again I'll choose</segment2>
		<segment3>There is no one else for me. None but Jesus. Crucified to set me free. Now I live to bring Him praise</segment3>
		<segment4>In the chaos, in confusion. I know You're sovereign still. In the moment of my weakness. You give me grace to do Your will</segment4>
		<segment5>So when You call I won't delay. This my song through all my days</segment5>
		<segment6>There is no one else for me. None but Jesus. Crucified to set me free. Now I live to bring Him praise</segment6>
		<segment7>All my delight is in You, Lord. All of my hope, all of my strength. All my delight is in You, Lord, forevermore    </segment7>
