		<segment1>It's so urgent; it's so desperate. I can feel it in my bones (yeah). To find a shovel and start digging. Under the water, bury myself</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. You're in my brain. In my brain. The life inside is breaking out. You're in my brain. In my brain. The life inside is breaking out</segment2>
		<segment3>It's getting stronger; I can't contain it. It's like a fire in my bones (yeah). It's taking over, recreating. Transforming my mind (yeah)</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>You're in my mind, in my mind. Breaking out [repeat]</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS (repeat)]    </segment6>
