		<segment1>Shallow pictures of the way that it was meant to be. Set the standard so we think like that. Open up your eyes. Normalicy is what you think youre living in. Time to see yourself for who you are. Time to live.</segment1>
		<segment2>Burn it down. Walk away. Tear it down. Walk away.</segment2>
		<segment3>Pass the folly of the greedy to the younger ones, Keep the righteous from the open wound. Gather up the dead. What is real?</segment3>
		<segment4>Burn it down. Walk away. Tear it down. Walk away.</segment4>
		<segment5>You were right.. You were right..    </segment5>
