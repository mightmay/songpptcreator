		<segment1>When sorrows come and hope seems gone. You're the rock I rest upon. When waters rise and I can't breathe. You're the love that rescues me. Out of the darkness. It lifts up my eyes. Unto the hills I feel my faith rise</segment1>
		<segment2>Maker of heaven. Giver of life. You are my strength, my song in the night. My refuge, my shelter, now and forevermore. My help comes from the Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>When I'm broken, scarred by sin. Death gives way to life again. When I suffer, when I'm bound. In You I'm free, In You I'm found</segment3>
		<segment4>Out of the darkness. It lifts up my eyes. Unto the hills I feel my faith rise</segment4>
		<segment5>Maker of heaven. Giver of life. You are my strength, my song in the night. My refuge, my shelter, now and forevermore. My help comes from the Lord</segment5>
		<segment6>Out of the darkness. It lifts up my eyes. Unto the hills I feel my faith rise</segment6>
		<segment7>Maker of heaven. Giver of life. You are my strength. You're my refuge now and forevermore</segment7>
		<segment8>Out of the darkness. It lifts up my eyes. Unto the hills I feel my faith rise</segment8>
		<segment9>Maker of heaven. Giver of life. You are my strength, my song in the night. My refuge, my shelter, now and forevermore. My help comes from the Lord. My help comes from the Lord    </segment9>
