		<segment1>Strangers are attacking me. Ruthless, they seek to steal my life. They have no regard for You Lord. Vindicate me by Your might</segment1>
		<segment2>Though the darkness tries to steal my heart. And it comes with out warning. But your mercy covers me because. It's new every morning</segment2>
		<segment3>I place my trust in Your holy blood. To cleanse and protect me from all my sin. Though the enemy rushes in. Your spirit will lift up a standard against him    </segment3>
