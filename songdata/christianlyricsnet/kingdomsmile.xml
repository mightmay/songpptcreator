		<segment1>His petty problems now left behind. No hesitation, purely divine. The first revelation. Was that he would be free. His second was he'd drown in grace. His frowning face replaced irresistibly. The floor meets his knees</segment1>
		<segment2>He's come and everyone in the kingdom wears a smile. Because He's won. Oh, He's come and waves of joy spread across the kingdom. Smile because He's won the battle</segment2>
		<segment3>All the excuses that you have brought. No explanation was ever sought. To stand before the King of Kings. To taste a kiss of life beyond. No expectations just your barren self. That's how He sees you anyway. Life is yours today</segment3>
		<segment4>You've come and everyone in the kingdom wears a smile. Because He's won. Oh, You've come and waves of joy spread across the kingdom. Smile because He's won. The battle is won    </segment4>
