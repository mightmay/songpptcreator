		<segment1>keep your eyes on center ring. see the foursome orbiting. miles above this mortal ground. cranking knobs to supersound. churning out the latest hits. just before the big ecplise. silvercoursed across the night. live, via satellite. viva satellite. get yourself some pay-per-view. of this lunar rock debut. buy the tee shirt right at home. simply use your touch-tone phone. thats one small step for man. one giant leap for MTV. let's hear it for the band as we live vicariously    </segment1>
