		<segment1>Oh youth, is wasted on the young. Ive been hearing this lately rolling off my tongue. So, my ground is in the past, so listen up closely: This could be my last. Does it matter what my age is, Lord? Am I the dust from the swept up floor? I had a song for the ages, forgotten in the pages. Come here. Ive got something to say. If youve heard it already, you can go out and play. So, Ill look you in the eyes. So, now youre all near me; theres no need to cry. Does it matter what my age is, Lord? Am I the dust from the swept up floor? I had a song for the ages, forgotten in the pages.    </segment1>
