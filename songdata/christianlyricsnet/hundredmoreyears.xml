		<segment1>Diamond ring and 12 red roses. Everything she ever wanted. All those dreams and now they're finally here. She's so young and he's so perfect. They waited for love and it was worth it. She wants to feel like this for a hundred years. All of this life still yet to live and they can hardly wait</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). They can laugh. They can cry. The future looks so beautiful and bright. They can dance. Under the moonlight. 'Cause God is smiling down on them tonight. And she wants to stay right here. Make it last for a hundred more years</segment2>
		<segment3>She's got blue eyes just like her mother. Three years old, he's crazy for her. He wants to freeze this day before it disappears. She's spinning like a little princess. Making sure he's gonna notice. He could watch her twirl for a hundred years. She'll grow up and she'll leave home but until that day</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). They can laugh. They can cry. The future looks so beautiful and bright. They can dance. Under the moonlight. 'Cause God is smiling down on them tonight. And she wants to stay right here. Make it last for a hundred more years</segment4>
		<segment5>And it's only time. But it flies right by. And today is sweeter than we know. And so they dance. Under the moonlight. 'Cause God is smiling down on them tonight. And they want to stay right here. For a hundred more years.     </segment5>
