		<segment1>They put on disguises today. To hide the scarlet letters. That each of us has put so far away</segment1>
		<segment2>In this which trial. Modern day</segment2>
		<segment3>Despite this it seems that the powers be. Have decided who I am. And who I will be</segment3>
		<segment4>Who I am who I'll be. Has been decided for me. And they don't even know me</segment4>
		<segment5>As they pounded in the stake. I thought I heard them say. Become like us or you will be slain</segment5>
		<segment6>You can't tell me who I am    </segment6>
