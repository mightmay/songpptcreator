		<segment1>Found in human likeness. And He reduced to the standards of the earth. In famine He dealt with sufferings. And in His deeds revealed His love and faith. And all selflessness. It's with His blood we bathe. To focus on the name of the Lord Jesus. The Son of God. And in fullness God Himself. He came to our filth. And died to our sins. Rising to consecrate glory. He rose us with Him from the abyss. Breaking our blackened deeds and intent. Rising within Him and now we live    </segment1>
