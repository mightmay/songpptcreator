		<segment1>Into your arms. Im drawing near again. To dwell with you. Its my only hearts desire. Its my only hearts desire. All I can do. Is fall on my knees and cry. Cleanse me with fire. And purify my heart. Draw me close. Closer than before. Closer than Ive ever been. Draw me close. Closer than before. Closer than I've ever been. Wrap me in your arms, oh God. [Repeat]. So take me to that place Lord, To that secret place where. I can be with you. You can make me like you. Wrap me in your arms. Wrap me in your arms. Wrap me in your arms (keep repeating). Wrap me in your arms. Wrap me in your arms. Wrap me in your arms (keep repeating)    </segment1>
