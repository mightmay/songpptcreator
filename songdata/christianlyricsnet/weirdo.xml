		<segment1>Elvis lives in Greece. has changed his name to Joe. The lunar lander filmed in Disney's Studio. God save me' I'm crazy? No!</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm a weirdo for knowin' what I know?. I'm a weirdo?. Whatever floats your boat I'm a weirdo?. I know I believe in You</segment2>
		<segment3>Mikey died from little rocks that could go pop. The army hides what just put circles in your crop. Oh maybe and I'm crazy? No!</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm a weirdo for knowin' what I know?. I'm a weirdo?. And dont it get your goat I'm a weirdo?. I know I believe in You</segment4>
		<segment5>We took a hit on the big bang. It screwed up the yin yang. If the truth is pig feed. then God is Siegfried and Roy - oh boy</segment5>
		<segment6>You know I believe it    </segment6>
