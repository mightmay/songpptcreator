		<segment1>I breathe the mist. floating about the stars. I can caress with velvet hands. I breathe the mist. floating within without. this pen between my fingers</segment1>
		<segment2>Messiah. I know you are there. within without me holding me. Messiah. I know you are there. catching carrying this beautiful mess</segment2>
		<segment3>escape the pain. within a room somewhere. escape the pain. so deep inside the soul. I have no key. no map to find    </segment3>
