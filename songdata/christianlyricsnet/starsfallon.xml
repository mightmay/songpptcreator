		<segment1>The moon is hanging low tonight. There's something different in your eyes. It's a complicated notion, knowing when to open my mouth and let my words flow freely. And I'm watching the sky tonight. The stars fall on, whenever I'm around you. The stars fall on a million miles away. Like me, they're falling at the words you say. I'm asking for a second chance, praying that you'll understand. It's a self destructive habit. Constantly protecting myself, never saying how I feel.     </segment1>
