		<segment1>I can't stand to lie; I got that from Eve. I just had a bite; You gave her, Lord, to me. I warned her at first; I more than explained. That's more than some pretty fruit beside a snake. But it's not easy to be deceived</segment1>
		<segment2>I wish that I could hide, find a pile of leaves. Finally we're wise, now my home I'll never see. There may be a curse upon me like Eve. But even she will have a righteous seed. I may be just dirt, but once she conceives. Even we may have our rights redeemed. But it's not easy to be with Eve</segment2>
		<segment3>Told us get away, away from here, but it's all alright. We can all be grounded tonight. I'm not angry or anything</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't stand to fight; I'm not mad at Eve. Men weren't meant for pride; it clouds the things they need. I'm only a man, but still You said she'd. Be pregnant with kids tonight and that's one way we. Know there's a plan, so Lord we'll yet seek. Looking for special things inside of Eve, in spite of me. In spite of me, inside of Eve, in spite of me</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm only a man in Genesis three. I'm only a man lookin' for a seed. I'm the only and there's only just Eve. And it's not Eden. It's not easy to leave here    </segment5>
