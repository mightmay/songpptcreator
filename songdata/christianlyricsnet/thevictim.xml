		<segment1>To me, you were just dead weight. A diluted filter blurring the color away from what this used to be or. Or what it could have been. </segment1>
		<segment2>But nothings changed. I still see you as a toxin. I still see you as the same. </segment2>
		<segment3>Ill let you stand on your own again, while youre playing the victim. </segment3>
		<segment4>To me, you were just the same. Like all of the others, accusing the leader of inflicting all the pain. that youve been feeling, feeling. But Id wait to find any tears of mine. I tried to let you come undone. </segment4>
		<segment5>But nothings changed. I still see you as a toxin. I still see you as the same. </segment5>
		<segment6>Ill let you stand on your own again, while youre playing the victim. Ill let you stand on your own, your own. </segment6>
		<segment7>Find a new way in, and take them all way. If Im the villain, well then take me all away. If I had the blade, Id cut the strings down from your limbs, and let you get away. </segment7>
		<segment8>Ill let you stand on your own again, while youre playing the victim. Ill let you stand on your own, your own.     </segment8>
