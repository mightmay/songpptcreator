		<segment1>The waves surround me, I'm slowly drowning. As I'm crying out for help. Grabbing hold of anything that looks. Like it can carry me through the night. And I -- I look up and then I see. Your hand reaching for me. Then I sing</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. My Jesus, my Father. The One who is stronger than the storm. My Hero, my only hope, You are. My Savior</segment2>
		<segment3>The sea starts raging, I'm quickly fading. As I take my eyes off You. Reality kicks in, and fear rises within. My soul and all of my faith is gone. But oh -- once again You take my hand. You lead me to dry land. Then I cry</segment3>
		<segment4>[Repeat Chorus:]</segment4>
		<segment5>You never grow tired or weary. You always hear my cry. Forever You'll be there beside me. Be lifted high</segment5>
