		<segment1>Take me or leave me, don't have to believe me. All the words I have to say, all the songs that fly away. Take me or leave me, believe me good will come</segment1>
		<segment2>It's OK, you know I'll live to fight another day. It's OK, you know I'll live to find another way</segment2>
		<segment3>She's as pretty as hell and her eyes have no home. The beauty has run from your face. Such beauty that hung from your face. And if you would drink this wine you'll shine</segment3>
		<segment4>It's OK, you know I'll live to fight another day. It's OK, you know I'll live to find the words to say. It's OK, you know I'll live to find another way. And if you would give me holy wine, I'll shine</segment4>
		<segment5>Will you come to me like a summer's day. I will sing again    </segment5>
