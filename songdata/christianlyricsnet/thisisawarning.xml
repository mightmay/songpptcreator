		<segment1>this is a warning for all of us that are falling. for the lie that we could bigger than God. you can tell us our future is coming. but it's got us running somebody sound the alarm. We arent perfect. No ones perfect</segment1>
		<segment2>this is a protest for all of us that are hungry. we can't shake the feeling do you know what i mean?. you can tell us there's no emergency but i feel the urgency i can see the flashing lights and burning skies. We arent perfect. No ones perfect.</segment2>
		<segment3>we don't get it and don't care if we do. we're not dealing with the consequence. we don't get it and don't care if we do. we're crying like we're innocent. we don't get it and don't care if we do. we're burning like a cigarette. we don't get it, don't care if we do. we're crying like we're innocent</segment3>
		<segment4>remember when we were young. we didn't need evidence. we had our innocence. now times slipping on by. our hearts are given away. what a mistake    </segment4>
