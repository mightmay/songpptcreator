		<segment1>We can always expect to lose radio, radio contact. Radio transmission every time that, I let our fair moon. Lay her body between us, I need her now that you're breaking up. </segment1>
		<segment2>Soon she'll become my new sun. Soon she'll become. She's stealing her light from the old one. </segment2>
		<segment3>Fast receiving but slow responding, To your signals reading &quot;Son, come home.&quot;. But I still believe it. My God, I still need it. But I'm just tired of walking upright. When I don't mean right, I just want to look right. </segment3>
		<segment4>We can always expect to lose radio, radio contact. Radio transmission. </segment4>
		<segment5>Soon she'll become my new sun. Soon she'll become dim reflected love, To light my way, After I trade loving you for loving to obey. </segment5>
		<segment6>'Cause even with my feet on the path, Our quite hearts lost contact. So now I'm wandering off, Just to hear you calling me back. </segment6>
		<segment7>We can always expect to lose.     </segment7>
