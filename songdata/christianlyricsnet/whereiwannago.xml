		<segment1>Sometimes when i feel like i am falling. Your love lifts me up and brings me hope again. Sometimes i close my eyes and imagine. You're right here with me reaching out your hand. Bringing me home. . That's where i wanna go. That's where i wanna stand. I don't even have to see it. 'cause i know where it's at. . It's a place that i believe in. Where the streets are made of gold. Let me tell you how to get there. 'cause that's where i wanna go. . There was a hole inside my heart that was empty. Longing for someone to take away the pain. But you came and gave me hope for tomorrow. That i will be with you and hear you call my name. . That's where i wanna go. That's where i wanna stand. I don't even have to see it. 'cause i know where it's at. . . It's a place that i believe in. Where the streets are made of gold. Let me tell you how to get there. 'cause that's where i wanna go. . Yeah i know i'm never gonna live a day without you. Every part of me is thankful that i found you. And everything inside of me just knows. That's where i wanna go yeah. . That's where i wanna go. That's where i wanna stand. I don't even have to see it. 'cause i know where it's at. . It's a place that i believe in. Where the streets are made of gold. Let me tell you how to get there. 'cause that's where i wanna go. . That's where i wanna go. My heart can't wait to get there. Oh where i wanna go    </segment1>
