		<segment1>Like I said. Leave your baggage at the back door. I'm leaving you the way I think it should be. We're always pulling into places that we can't back out of. Starting fights we can't talk our way out of them</segment1>
		<segment2>How does it feel to be on the recieving end of this one?</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm half way there and it's all on me. This is what I get for wanting more. This is the way it has to be. Dancing on all these changes. So I walk around with this rope in my hand</segment3>
		<segment4>So I'll tie it around and around. I'll tie me down</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll fantasize of being manic. And leaving us behind. In your eyes you were the one that tried</segment5>
		<segment6>Acceptance is what holds us here. And you my dear are the one I fear tonight. We'll try just one more time</segment6>
		<segment7>This is the moment that we all live for. Are you ready?</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm half way there and it's all on me. This is what I get for wanting more. This is the way it has to be. Dancing on all these changes. So I walk around with this rope in my hand</segment8>
		<segment9>So I'll tie it around and around. I'll tie me down</segment9>
		<segment10>You cant see past my waving hands. just running away again</segment10>
		<segment11>You think so loud it hurts my ears.. I want to know how to get through this. Without choking up. I can't feel you. You're so far from me</segment11>
		<segment12>I'm half way there and it's all on me    </segment12>
