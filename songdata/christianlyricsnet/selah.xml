		<segment1>Kick down the teeth of the wicked creep. undaground where I stay hid lurk down the alleyways, you be stockin'. me behind back talkers, cowards be mockin' me. Try to make me talk, make me confess can't break a brotha down, when there's no fear of death that filled with the light, so you cant stand the sight of me. next to the conquering lion, at His right I be. Step up, punks, get rushed, you can't touch me braced in your word, I say, I have no fear. Step up punks, get rushed, you can't touch me. Sheltered by your blood, your sweat, your tears. I be all in your face, state my case. even if you took me out there's another to take my place you waste, prisoner to your own pride. you can never kill me off, got too much life in the inside kill me, beat me, break my bones, already gave up my life, you'll never have my soul. give the credit to the one, who paid for your crimes suffer for HIS name, &amp; I'll die for mines. Step up, punks, get rushed, you can't touch me braced in your word, I say, I have no fear. Step up punks, get rushed, you can't touch me. (Selah) Identify your real master recognize &amp; obey the SACRAFICE 8x     </segment1>
