		<segment1>I flirt with the world. It steals my love for You. My fear grips my faith. And I am left unmoved</segment1>
		<segment2>Your gaze stops my heart. Your voice fills the dark. Your love is the spark that lights this life. So we rise</segment2>
		<segment3>Out of the depths you cry. Come and be satisfied. Father, You sing. Father, You sing over Your children</segment3>
		<segment4>You quiet the storm. Inside my shipwrecked soul. Your spirit will lead. It calls the wayward home</segment4>
		<segment5>At the sound of Your name. Our sin is washed away. In Christ we're crucified. In You we die, in You we rise</segment5>
		<segment6>Out of the depths you cry. Come and be satisfied. Father, You sing. Father, You sing over Your children</segment6>
		<segment7>Let us see through Your eyes. We are Your great delight. Father You sing. Father, You sing over Your children</segment7>
		<segment8>And we're singing along. Your daughters and sons. We're singing Your song. We are Your children</segment8>
		<segment9>Out of the depths you cry. Come and be satisfied. Father, You sing. Father, You sing over Your children</segment9>
		<segment10>Let us see through Your eyes. We are Your great delight. Father, You sing. Father, You sing over Your children    </segment10>
