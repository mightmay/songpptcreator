		<segment1>It seems like everything I touch just falls to pieces. It seems like everyone I help just falls. And how I need someone to make me feel assured. I don't need anyone if You're on my side, Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>And I say, hey, who can be against me?</segment2>
		<segment3>No matter how hard I try I always fail. I'll never be like Christ. I know I'll struggle until the day, the very day I die. And how I need someone to make me feel assured. I don't need anyone if You're on my side, Lord. . And I say, hey, who can be against me?</segment3>
		<segment4>God look at me, I'm just a man. But You tell me I'm not just a man. You're so hard to understand, after all I'm just a man. God you tell me not to doubt. But I'm always plagued by doubt. And You always help me out. I'm so ashamed (of my doubt)    </segment4>
