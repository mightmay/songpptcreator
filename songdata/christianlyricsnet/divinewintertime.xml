		<segment1>I spread my minds wings and arise towards the sky. I fulfil all my dreams and to the essence of winter I fly..</segment1>
		<segment2>To finest of weathers my wings are taking me. Caress of moon at frozen fields. Snowflakes floating down, forest of snowbound. Stars give everything a shine.</segment2>
		<segment3>Now it's time to rest my mind at this Divine Wintertime. It's time to rest your mind at this Divine Wintertime. Winter.. Into the nature's eyes I stare now and feel 'em staring back. This unity sets me free. My quest for divinity has lead me here and here I'll stay. Loving embrace of God.</segment3>
		<segment4>Now it's time to rest my mind at this Divine Wintertime. It's time to rest your mind at this Divine Wintertime.</segment4>
		<segment5>Winter. Divine.. Wintertime.. Divine.. Wintertime..    </segment5>
