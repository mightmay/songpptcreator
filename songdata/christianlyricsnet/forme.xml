		<segment1>(verse 1). When you think about your life. and all that you've been through. Did the tears and the sweat. ever really pay the dues. for you labor, your labor. to justify your own. in a life you could not savor. 'cause you towed the weight alone</segment1>
		<segment2>(verse 2). Hope is fading. I can see it in your eyes. 'cause you never found the answer to. the questions deep inside. so you hunger, you hunger. for the taste of something new. just to quench your desperation. for the peace you never knew</segment2>
		<segment3>(pre-chorus) (not sang first time)</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). Well I know it's hard, cause I've tried. Not to fail, just to get it right. But the bearer, of it all. He was the Lamb, that took the fall. For me</segment4>
		<segment5>(verse 3). When you think about your life. and all that you've been through. Did the tears and the sweat. ever really pay the dues. for your labor, your anger. to try to justify your own. In a life you can not savor. 'cause you towed the weight alone</segment5>
		<segment6>(pre-chorus). you say you want it. you say you wanted too</segment6>
		<segment7>(chorus) (chorus)    </segment7>
