		<segment1>This might hurt. It's not safe. But I know that I've gotta make a change. I don't care. If I break. At least I'll be feeling something</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause just OK. Is not enough. Help me fight through the nothingness of life</segment2>
		<segment3>I dont wanna go through the motions. I dont wanna go one more day. Without Your all consuming passion inside of me. I dont wanna spend my whole life asking. What if I had given everything?. Instead of going through the motions</segment3>
		<segment4>No regrets. Not this time. I'm gonna let my heart defeat my mind. Let Your love. Make me whole. I think Im finally feeling something</segment4>
		<segment5>'Cause just OK. Is not enough. Help me fight through the nothingness of life</segment5>
		<segment6>I dont wanna go through the motions. I dont wanna go one more day. Without Your all consuming passion inside of me. I dont wanna spend my whole life asking. What if I had given everything?. Instead of going through the motions</segment6>
		<segment7>Take me all the way. Take me all the way    </segment7>
