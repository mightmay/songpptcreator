		<segment1>. I dont think my heart can take it. Another empty day might break it. I need you more than ever before. I found out what it is Im missing</segment1>
		<segment2>You</segment2>
		<segment3>I know your heart can barely take it. To see me grab this day and break it. I need you more than ever before. I found out what it is Im missing</segment3>
