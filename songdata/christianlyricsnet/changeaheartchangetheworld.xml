		<segment1>Every dreamer has dreamed of a perfect life. I know the world has been trying for years to get it right. We try and try, but find it impossible to do. Don't you wish we could make this a better place. Can't you see that we must live life a different way. Every day, imagine what love could turn this to </segment1>
		<segment2>Wanna change the world, then change your mind. We'll light the darkness one life at a time </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. When we change a heart, we change the world. A spark of love can turn into a fire bright as the sun. If you change a heart today. Then that could change a million tomorrows. What started as a whisper will echo on and on. When we change a heart, we change the world. A voice is waking a heart to the light of day. A tiny flicker of hope can push the night away. It's safe to say a caring heart brings another back. Can you fathom a world where we open up. Can you picture the day we've all been dreaming of. Live and love like right now is all we really have. Wanna change the world, then change your mind. We'll find forever one day at a time. Chorus. You may think it's crazy. But that's alright with me. It's gonna take some time to find the way. But I believe.. </segment3>
