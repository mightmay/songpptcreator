		<segment1>Boy know your place, lies do not become us. Real is more attractive than a slick and polished mask. Girl dig down deep, I know there's more between us. There's bound to be a question you're just dying for me to ask</segment1>
		<segment2>If you can be honest, I can be too. If you'll take the first step, I'll follow you through. But no one wants to bleed, no one wants to hide. No one wants to hurt, alone inside</segment2>
		<segment3>Child, don't close your eyes the truth contains much beauty. And though it scars your soul, it can heal the wounds it makes. You've been deceived to think the pain is to be dreaded. When you've got nothing left, it'll give more than it takes</segment3>
		<segment4>If you can't find the peace, I'll help find it for you. I don't know how, but one thing. that's sure is I won't leave you now    </segment4>
