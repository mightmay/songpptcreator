		<segment1>I can still remember, not so very. Long ago. In nineteen seventy seven. We would sit and we would talk. About forever in our little house on Lugo. It was our little piece of heaven</segment1>
		<segment2>We would laugh. We would dream. You'd embrace me and make. Me believe</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. If the sky should fall to the sea. I would live in the hope of your. Sweet mystery. You have faith in me. And forever I will be. A true believer</segment3>
		<segment4>If the sky should fall to the sea. I would live in the hope of. Your sweet mystery. You have faith in me. And forever I will be. A true believer</segment4>
		<segment5>If I had to do it over, I could do it. All again. Just to know you're right here by. My side. Today I give myself to you, that was. The day my life changed. With a single touch, my life came alive</segment5>
		<segment6>You gave me wings. Made my dream. You embraced me and made. Me believe. With my eyes open wide. I could finally see. That only a miracle. Could ever move my soul and make. My heart believe. You made a believer out of me    </segment6>
