		<segment1>Finish up your coffee, love. it's getting cold. let's finish up this fight tonight. before the sun draws neigh and I'm old </segment1>
		<segment2>Have mercy on me I'm a girl. though I'm cruel and you cry. I won't shiver cause I know how to break a man. I know how to break a man in two </segment2>
		<segment3>Still you're suffering, my love. o, who's to blame?. you might be tired, but I'm not through fanning the flame </segment3>
		<segment4>o, by the tiding of my tounge. I lie and sing what can't be unsung. my soul torn in two by the things I say to you. by the things that I say </segment4>
		<segment5>I know how to break us man, in two </segment5>
		<segment6>.     </segment6>
