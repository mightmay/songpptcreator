		<segment1>Oh, You are love like we have never known. Before the world was born. You had named us and called us Your own. We are Yours. And were broken at Your feet</segment1>
		<segment2>We all, we all, we all fall to the ground. Cause Youre right here with us. We all, we all, we all fall to the ground. At the name of Jesus. We all, we all, we all lift up You, now</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, its a wonder that we can engage. The King of Heaven lives. In our hearts and we know Your embrace is this. You have died for us</segment3>
		<segment4>We all, we all, we all fall to the ground. Cause Youre right here with us. We all, we all, we all fall to the ground. At the name of Jesus. We all, we all, we all lift up You, now</segment4>
