		<segment1>What a beautiful sight for the worn and weary eye. The glimmering light in the corner of a broken sky. Hope sweet hope like a star burning bright. When the sun goes down and the fears begin to fly</segment1>
		<segment2>Hopes not giving up. Hopes not giving up. In a cold dark night shes not giving. Not giving up</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold on tight this citys about to break. In the middle of the night lying there wide awake. Hope sweet hope how much more can she take. Being our strength when our hearts are out of faith</segment3>
		<segment4>bridge: Hope is with me in my time of trouble. When it all comes crashing down she will stay. By my side digging through the rubble. Shes not giving up - not giving up - not giving up    </segment4>
