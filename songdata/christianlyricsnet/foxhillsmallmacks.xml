		<segment1>[PJ:] Sup girl?. [PJ:] What's your name?. [Girl:] Hi, my name is Harmony. [PJ:] True. [Girl:] I'm from Venice, California. [PJ:] I like that. [Girl:] And I'm representing Fairfax High School. [PJ:] What?. [Girl:] Melrose</segment1>
		<segment2>It's like, uh, what's up girl?. I'm ? baby, it's a whole different world. Like, sssssssss..uh. You've never seen. Dirty clothes but the caddy real clean like. Mmmmmmm..some dishes. I'm so hungry, you look delicious. Rocked in your Chucks and your Big E Levis. Label says big size. I like your little turtle-neck too (True). TJ-Max right? Hmm, do what you do. You lookin' like you seen money before. And your used to these dudes openin' the door (True). Hmm, yep that's what I thought. You the Red Ridin' Hood and you wanna get caught. Speak, or forever hold your peace. Alone, I'm PJ, put your digits in the phone</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus: x3]. (c'mon) Just want it. (c'mon) Just do it. (c'mon) Just believe me and then prove it</segment3>
		<segment4>(c'mon!)</segment4>
		<segment5>What's up girl?. You drinkin' too much. You better ?. What you lookin' at?. Forget them dudes. They buffed up cause they do not got attitude. Like me, I'm too O.G. Raised up in the streets to redefine free. Hey, them other dudes is weird. You can see they insecure from way over here. Fresh out of Foot Locker. Lookin' like some athletes. They the real geeks, believe it!. Been off the Varsity team, yo fo' real. Still dressin' like they on a football field. Yes yes y'all, okay back to you. About to get some coffee, should I make it two?. Girl you better say yes. Especially if you wanna roll Rock Seven instead of Guess. Like it's '88, I just got a deal. I'm about to flip the whole dang plate (for real). Plus you look like Gidget. The only thing missin' is your digit</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus: x3]. (c'mon) Just want it. (c'mon) Just do it. (c'mon) Just believe me and then prove it</segment6>
		<segment7>You drinkin' too much. You better ?.     </segment7>
