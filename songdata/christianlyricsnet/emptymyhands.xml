		<segment1>I've got voices in my head and they are so strong. And I'm getting sick of this oh Lord, how long. Will I be haunted by the fear that I believe. My hands like locks on cages. Of these dreams I can't set free</segment1>
		<segment2>But if I let these dreams die. If I lay down all my wounded pride. If I let these dreams die. Will I find that letting go lets me come alive</segment2>
		<segment3>So empty my hands. Fill up my heart. Capture my mind with you</segment3>
		<segment4>These voices speak instead and what's right is wrong. And I'm giving into them, please Lord, how long. Will I be held captive by the lies that I believe. My heart's in constant chaos and it keeps me so deceived</segment4>
		<segment5>But if I let these dreams die. If I could just lay down my dark desire. If I let these dreams die. Will I find you brought me back to life</segment5>
		<segment6>My mind is like a building burning down. I need your grace to keep me, keep me from the ground. And my heart is just a prisoner of war. A slave to what it wants and to what I'm fighting for</segment6>
