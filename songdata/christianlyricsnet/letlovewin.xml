		<segment1>This is the start, align the moment. That your hearts waited for. The road it stops in front of you. And you don't know where to go. The excuses fade and you run away. You will never be the same. You will never be the same</segment1>
		<segment2>This is the debt of fate you've tried to pay. But just won't let you go. Through the years &amp; tears that have held you here. Like a slave to your own soul. But the time has come to turn and run. To never be the same. You don't have to live this way</segment2>
		<segment3>The sun is bright, Hope is here again. The morning light capturing you here. And Grace appears to bring you back again. Open up your eyes, stop and soak it in. And let love win</segment3>
		<segment4>This is the moment of these days. That for years you've waited for. And all that stands in front of you. Compels you to let go. But a moment of fright and the fear in your eyes. Don't have to win this time</segment4>
		<segment5>The sun is bright, Hope is here again. The morning light capturing you here. And Grace appears to bring you back again. Open up your eyes, stop and soak it in</segment5>
		<segment6>Whoa. Stop and soak it in. Grace appears to bring you brand new life again. Just stop and soak it in. I still believe that you can let love win</segment6>
		<segment7>The sun is bright, Hope is here again. The morning light capturing you here. And Grace appears to bring you back again. Open up your eyes, stop and soak it in. And let love win    </segment7>
