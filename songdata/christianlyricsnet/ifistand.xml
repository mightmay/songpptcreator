		<segment1>There's more that rises in the morning. Than the sun. And more that shines in the night. Than just the moon. It's more than just this fire here. That keeps me warm. In a shelter that is larger. Than this room</segment1>
		<segment2>And there's a loyalty that's deeper. Than mere sentiments. And a music higher than the songs. That I can sing. The stuff of Earth competes. For the allegiance. I owe only to the giver. Of all good things</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: So if I stand let me stand on the promise. That you will pull me through. And if I can't, let me fall on the grace. That first brought me to You. And if I sing let me sing for the joy. That has born in me these songs. And if I weep let it be as a man. Who is longing for his home</segment3>
		<segment4>There's more that dances on the prairies. Than the wind. More that pulses in the ocean. Than the tide. There's a love that is fiercer. Than the love between friends. More gentle than a mother's. When her baby's at her side</segment4>
		<segment5>And there's a loyalty that's deeper. Than mere sentiments. And a music higher than the songs. That I can sing. The stuff of Earth competes. For the allegence. I owe only to the Giver. Of all good things</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS(2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>And if I weep let it be as a man. Who is longing for his home    </segment7>
