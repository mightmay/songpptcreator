		<segment1>Leaves are falling, and something's calling me here. The state of depression that I'm walking in. Got the impression that I won't stay here long. I know I am like this, but still I don't know what to do</segment1>
		<segment2>The sky is darkening. I can feel it in the air. My heart is sinking. I know winter's on its way. I know I am like this. But still I don't know what to do. I know I am like this. Oh sister, show me what to do</segment2>
		<segment3>I know there's a way to get this another day. When will Iknow if there's a way for me?. I want to lie in the sand and have the sun shine on me. Is that way too much to ask?    </segment3>
