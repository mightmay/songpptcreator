		<segment1>Sometimes, it gets hard upon this beaten road. Sometimes, I am tempted just to walk alone</segment1>
		<segment2>But I hear Your words out of my mouth. Wanting, expecting that. The seeds that I've sown this time. I'll reap in a short while</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll run and not grow weak. Walk and will not faint. Climb the highest mountain to dive off. And I'll fly high on. I'll fly high on broken wings</segment3>
		<segment4>All I desire is everything that You are. Strength is renewed as I wait on You, God.     </segment4>
