		<segment1>They say dont waste your time. You simply cannot find. An ounce of good within the heart of man</segment1>
		<segment2>They say weve got to lay. In the bed weve made. And live this life without a second chance</segment2>
		<segment3>But Im inclined to say. There must be something more</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Weve been told that the heart is just too far gone to save. But grace tells us another story. Where glory sends hopelessness away. Oh grace tells us another story </segment4>
		<segment5>They say we cannot change. There is no other way. Get used it cause this is all there is.</segment5>
		<segment6>They say dont raise your voice. Cause we dont have a choice. Were dealt this hand so learn to live with it</segment6>
		<segment7>Well I have to believe. There must something more</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Bridge. And though we may not understand. Why Youd give us another chance. We praise You who lets us start again</segment9>
		<segment10>Chorus.     </segment10>
