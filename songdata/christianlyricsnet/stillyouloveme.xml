		<segment1>I've never felt, so undeserving. Then when You called out for me. I've never been, more unworthy. When You reached down for me. I'm lifting hands, stained and dirty. To touch my Savior's face. And I know now, I am touching grace</segment1>
		<segment2>You see everything I do. And still You love me. 'Cause You hear everything I say. And still You want me. 'Cause You know all my darkest secrets. That I try so hard to hide. You know everything I am. And still You love me. Still You love me</segment2>
		<segment3>Amazing love, how can it be. That You would die for me?. Amazing grace, oh the mystery. My blinded eyes now see. When I fall, when I stumble. I stuggle to my feet. Just to find, grave is lifting me</segment3>
		<segment4>You see everything I do. And still You love me. 'Cause You hear everything I say. And still You want me. 'Cause You know all my darkest secrets. That I try so hard to hide. You know everything I am. And still You love me. Still You love me</segment4>
		<segment5>There's nothing I can say. To make You turn away. There's nowhere I can go. You're never far away</segment5>
		<segment6>(You see everything I do. And still You love me. 'Cause You hear everything I say. And still You want me)</segment6>
		<segment7>You see everything I do. And still You love me. 'Cause You hear everything I say. And still You want me. 'Cause You know all my darkest secrets. That I try so hard to hide. You know everything I am. And still You love me. (Still You love me). Still You love me. Still You love me    </segment7>
