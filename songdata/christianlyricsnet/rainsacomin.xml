		<segment1>Crawl down. Won't you come on down. Run down with me. Fly down. Come on down. Run down. The rain's coming!</segment1>
		<segment2>The ship was all but grounded for the tide had not come in. After forty days of waiting for the journey to begin. Now the castaways are stranded and the natives have grown thin. And the fuses that were lit have come to their end     </segment2>
