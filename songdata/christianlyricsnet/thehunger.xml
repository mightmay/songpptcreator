		<segment1>Cut it out, cut it out. I know it's what. You're wanting to say</segment1>
		<segment2>Burning up, burning up. I know why. You're feeling this way</segment2>
		<segment3>There's an ache. You can't erase. A yearning. That you can't replace</segment3>
		<segment4>And you want Him. And you need Him. But you act. Like He's not there. Yeah, you know. That you're hollow. And something's. Missing here. So you push. And you pull. The hole in your soul. But you can't make. The hunger disappear</segment4>
		<segment5>You got a rusted out. Lock on your door. Getting ready to break. You've held back. Love long enough. I think it's time to cave</segment5>
		<segment6>You're waiting for a sign. The fact is faith is blind</segment6>
		<segment7>Do you want to spend. Your whole life jaded?. Stuck in a rut. That you created. Why don't you. Break the cycle?. Let love win    </segment7>
