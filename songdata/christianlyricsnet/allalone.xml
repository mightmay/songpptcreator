		<segment1>Icy chills round your heart. A heart that's made of stone. It seems like. Life is out to get you. To destroy what you want. I know that, that you blame me for all that you go through. It could be, so different if you would just let it go</segment1>
		<segment2>You're all alone. Running out of ways to. Hold on to hope. And it always slips away. You're all alone. But you don't have to. Pretend to cope. There is a brighter way</segment2>
		<segment3>If you would change your perspective. You'd see that it is true. Life is not always what you want. Sometimes it's hard to bear. I'd be with you, and help you in all that you go through. I love you, let Me change your heart by coming in</segment3>
		<segment4>You're all alone. Running out of ways to. Hold on to hope. And it always slips away. You're all alone. But you don't have to. Pretend to cope. There is a brighter way    </segment4>
