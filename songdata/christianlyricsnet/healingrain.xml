		<segment1>Healing rain is coming down. It's coming nearer to this old town. Rich and poor, weak and strong. It's bringing mercy, it won't be long</segment1>
		<segment2>Healing rain is coming down. It's coming closer to the lost and found. Tears of joy, and tears of shame. Are washed forever in Jesus' name</segment2>
		<segment3>Healing rain, it comes with fire. So let it fall and take us higher. Healing rain, I'm not afraid. To be washed in Heaven's rain</segment3>
		<segment4>Lift your heads, let us return. To the mercy seat where time began. And in your eyes, I see the pain. Come soak this dry heart with healing rain</segment4>
		<segment5>And only You, the Son of man. Can take a leper and let him stand. So lift your hands, they can be held. By someone greater, the great I Am</segment5>
		<segment6>Healing rain, it comes with fire. So let it fall and take us higher. Healing rain, I'm not afraid. To be washed in Heaven's rain</segment6>
		<segment7>To be washed in Heaven's rain..</segment7>
		<segment8>Healing rain is falling down. Healing rain is falling down. I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid..    </segment8>
