		<segment1>(Chorus). Take me back, take me back dear Lord. To the place where I first believed you. Take me back, take me back dear Lord where I. first believe. </segment1>
		<segment2>(Verse). I feel that I'm so far from you Lord. But still I hear you calling me. Those simple things that I once knew, The memories are drawing me. I must confess, Lord I've been blessed. But yet my soul's not satisfied. Renew my faith, restore my joy. And dry my weaping eyes. </segment2>
		<segment3>(Repeat Chorus) </segment3>
		<segment4>(Bridge). I tried so hard. To make it all alone. I need your help. Just to make it home. </segment4>
		<segment5>(Repeat Chorus)     </segment5>
