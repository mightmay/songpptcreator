		<segment1>Sunrise on Sunset Beach. Finds me right where I watched it set. I spent the night inside myself. But I haven't found me yet</segment1>
		<segment2>But I'm not running from you anymore. I'm not running from you anymore, no not anymore</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause I believe that when I call for you. You hear the plea for my rescue. And You lift me up above the world I know. And I know that when I speak Your name. You hear my voice and send your saints. To cover me in the shadow of angels</segment3>
		<segment4>I got caught in the memories. Cause they never fail to prove. I'm insecure and incomplete. It's a stinging point of truth</segment4>
		<segment5>So I will never find the best of me. Until I find myself in You, I'll find myself in You    </segment5>
