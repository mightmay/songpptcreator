		<segment1>Don't be late. There's no time to be afraid. There's a way. To clean up the mess you made</segment1>
		<segment2>If I could tell the truth. Or lie would I attempt to do at the same time. Expect you to apologize for trying. to make me so up tight. Don't say its just a game we play. I can't loose the taste</segment2>
		<segment3>If you regulate how the blood is pumping. Through the veins from my heart into my brain. In time this blood supply. Will change me from red to white. Every thought that you know I'm thinking. may as well be the knife stuck in my back. This taxing fever makes me gravitate to this place</segment3>
		<segment4>This is still my life. And yours to defy</segment4>
		<segment5>Anyone in their right mind would ever let you inside. Anyone in their right mind. A broken ties with the neighborhood. A feeling like. From an empty glass. Of nothing good. And ..?</segment5>
		<segment6>Deciding as i wait for her to entertain. Careful not to (to breath in [3x]). The right time and the right way to elevate. Careful not to (to breath in [3x]). To breath in the air that so proudly puts to death. My own fathers name. I remember when your hand started shaking. There's a better way to clean up the mess you've been making.     </segment6>
