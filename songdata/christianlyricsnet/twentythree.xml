		<segment1>Set out to find a love, to live a life. To stay awake and clean and pure. And never allow the burdens. And excess of this place to harm you. Like all the rest of those sent here before you. But somehow, somewhere along the way. A scar was sown inside of you. And you thought it was an isolated thing until. Life pushed on and you noticed that the scars were too many. To count and let go because hate is part of you. So what happened to the innocent face you once knew?. Now it's just a reflection of this place. And you pray and bed that someday you'd escape</segment1>
		<segment2>What if I told you that you didn't have to stay?. What if I told you that peace is real?. What if you heard that there was a better way?. Would you come home if you knew the way?    </segment2>
