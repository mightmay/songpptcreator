		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on Hebrews 6:1a, Romans 1:17, Philippians 1:6</segment1>
		<segment2>We're content to pitch our tent. When the glory's evident. Seldom do we know the glory came and went </segment2>
		<segment3>Moving can seem dangerous. In this stranger's pilgrimage. Knowing that you can't stand still, you cross the bridge </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). There's a higher place to go, beyond belief, beyond belief. Where we reach the next plateau, beyond belief, beyond belief. And from faith to faith we grow. Towards the center of the flow. Where He beckons us to go, beyond belief, beyond belief </segment4>
		<segment5>Leap of faith without a net </segment5>
		<segment6>Makes us want to hedge our bet. Waters never part until our feet get wet </segment6>
		<segment7>There's a deeper place to go. Where the road seems hard to hoe. He who has begun this work won't let it go </segment7>
		<segment8>And it takes so long to see the change. But we look around and it seems so strange </segment8>
		<segment9>We have come so far but the journey's long. And we once were weak but now we're strong.     </segment9>
