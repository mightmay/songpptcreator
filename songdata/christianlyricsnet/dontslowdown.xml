		<segment1>With a heart so pure. You could fall so quickly. But don't you dare slow down for me. Were it not for hearts like mine. Calloused thickly. You could fall so easily. (Don't you dare slow down for me)</segment1>
		<segment2>You could take everything I have. Just don't leave my side now, don't leave my side. You could take everything I have. Just don't leave my side now, don't leave my side</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it. This moment could be our last. You fall in love and I'm running after. You move way too fast</segment3>
		<segment4>But don't slow down. And don't let go. Hold me close now, lest I fall. They say I don't know how to love the right way. But you make me feel, you make me feel like I do</segment4>
		<segment5>You could take everything I have. Just don't leave my side now, don't leave my side. You could take everything I have. Just don't leave my side now, don't leave my side</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it. This moment could be our last. You fall in love and I'm running after. You move way too fast</segment6>
		<segment7>Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it. (Don't slow down). This moment could be our last. (Don't slow down). You fall in love and I'm running after. (Don't slow down). You move way too fast</segment7>
		<segment8>Don't slow down. Don't slow down</segment8>
		<segment9>Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it. This moment could be our last. You fall in love and I'm running after. You move way too fast</segment9>
		<segment10>Cause your words hit like a train and I can't ignore it. (Don't slow down). This moment could be our last. (Don't slow down). You fall in love and I'm running after. (Don't slow down). You move way too fast</segment10>
		<segment11>Don't slow down. Don't slow down.     </segment11>
