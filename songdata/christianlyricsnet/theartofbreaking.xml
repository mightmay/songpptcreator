		<segment1>Every time I call you on the phone. I listen to it ring but no one's home. I can't explain the energy that. You give me when I'm left here alone</segment1>
		<segment2>And every time I pass you on the street. You won't even turn and look at me. I never would of thought that things could. Go this far but please believe me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll pick you up, won't let you fall. I'll build your trust and it won't hurt at all, Your only drug will let you down, I'm through now, so take me and blow me away</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS: When I feel numb I'll let you know. I won't become what I was before, You cannot kill what's not your creation. This is the Art of Breaking</segment4>
		<segment5>I think I might just lose my mind. If I have to watch this one more time. I can't explain how many times I've stayed for you when you were on my mind. No one ever said that it was easy. So come out of the cold and stop your bleeding. I never would of thought that things could. Go this far, but please believe me</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll pick you up, won't let you fall. I'll build your trust and it won't hurt at all, Your only drug will let you down, I'm through now, so take me and blow me away</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>Are you gonna run away? (4x)</segment8>
		<segment9>Are you gonna run away, and leave me here alone?. Are you gonna run away, and leave me ?</segment9>
		<segment10>CHORUS (2x)</segment10>
		<segment11>This is The Art of Breaking (3x)     </segment11>
