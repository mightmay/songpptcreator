		<segment1>I've played in L.A. and D.C., Manhattan and Sydney. And Kingston, Jamaica where my Mandy was made. It's 98 degrees in the straight-up shade. I say I'm stickin' with her for the rest of my given days</segment1>
		<segment2>Somebody told me that you're takin' a break. A sabbatical from rhymin' on the records that you make. A little birdie said that wasn't the case. They blamed your exodus on DC partners Kevin and Tait</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold up, I didn't say all that</segment3>
		<segment4>I wanna move the people on a hot summer's day. I wanna serve up the Truth like it's pink lemonade</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS. So if you're wonderin' why I. Continue to try my. Skills at this rap game. Girl, I can't get enough. I been rockin' the black folks. And tellin' those white jokes. And people are people. So just throw your hands up. If you're wonderin' why I. Continue to try my. Skills at this rap game. Girl, I can't get enough. I been rockin' the church folks. And tellin' those same jokes. So all of God's people. Won't ya throw your hands up</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been away for some down time. But thought it was bout time. To give my freaky people what they came here for. I guess I needed some head space. And felt that by God's grace. My homosapiens would still be up for some more. I'm talkin' God in my hip-hop. If not, then my show stops. And everyone around me knows I ain't gonna sell&quot;out. To those bad guys, they pushin' them white lies. Tweak the word freak and you'll be airing tonight guys</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>I wanna move the people on a hot summer's day. I wanna serve up the Truth like it's pink lemonade. I wanna give my people what they can't deny. I wanna light up the skies like the Fourth of July    </segment8>
