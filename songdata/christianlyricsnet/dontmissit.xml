		<segment1>Burn up the interstate got somewhere you need to be. Your. Not gonna let nobody slow you down. Turn off the radio and turn up your telephone. You don't have time to smell the roses now. Oh but take a second maybe. Before it gets too loud. Breathe before your breath runs out. Don't try so hard to move past the moment. These days go by. And they're gone before you know it. So come on open your window. Let the light shine in. This is life don't miss it. What if you took the time to really suck it in. Cause someday your gonna wish you did. Like a September morning. Like snow without a warning. Like how the summer feels upon your skin. But take a minute maybe. Before the sun goes down. Breathe before your breath runs out. Don't try so hard to move past the moment. These days go by. And they're gone before you know it. So come on open your window. Let the light shine in. This is life don't miss it. (this is life). Just take a second maybe. Before the sun goes down. Breathe before your breath runs out. Don't try so hard to move past the moment. These days go by. And they're gone before you know it. So come on open your window. Let the light shine in. This is life don't miss it. (this is life). Don't miss it. Don't miss it    </segment1>
