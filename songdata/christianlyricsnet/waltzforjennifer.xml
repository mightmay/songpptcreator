		<segment1>Another long day is gone. And I'm ready for another long night. Where I'll be by your side. Another long day will come. And I'll thank Jesus that I am alive and. That He made you mine</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). We belong together you and me. Holding on tight like lock and key. Going strong the way this love should be our fantasy. And I'm so glad that God made me for you and you for me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm having that dream. Where we are walking together along. With the sand in our feet. And I'm awake and I realize it wasn't a dream. It was reality</segment3>
