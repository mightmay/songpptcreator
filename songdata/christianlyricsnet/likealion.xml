		<segment1>[verse:]. Let love explode and bring the dead to life*. A love so bold. To see a revolution somehow. Let love explode and bring the dead to life. A love so bold. To bring a revolution somehow. . [prej-chorus:]. Now i'm lost in your freedom. This world i'll overcome. . [chorus:]. My god is not dead. He's surely alive. . He's living on the inside. Roaring like a lion. . [verse 2:]. Let hope arise and make the darkness hide. My faith is dead. I need a resurrection somehow. . [bridge:]. Let heaven roar and fire fall. Come shake the ground. With the sound of revival. [repeat:]    </segment1>
