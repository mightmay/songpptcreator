		<segment1>Everyone needs compassion, love thats never failing. Let mercy fall on me. Everyone needs forgiveness, the kindness of a saviour. The hope of nations</segment1>
		<segment2>Saviour, He can move the mountains. My God is mighty to save. He is mighty to save. Forever, author of salvation. He rose and conquered the grave. Jesus conquered the grave. Shine your light and let the whole world see. Shine your light and let the whole world see</segment2>
		<segment3>So take me as you find me  all my fears and failures. Fill my life again. I give my life to follow everything I believe in. Now I surrender</segment3>
		<segment4>Were singing shine your light and let the whole world see. Were singing for the glory of the risen king</segment4>
		<segment5>My Saviour, You can move the mountains. You are mighty to save. You are mighty to save. Forever, author of salvation. You rose and conquered the grave. Oh You conquered the grave. Jesus conquered the grave.     </segment5>
