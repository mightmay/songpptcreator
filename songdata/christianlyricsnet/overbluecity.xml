		<segment1>you try to cross the universe. I'm in the way, I fill it. that satallite your longing for. revolves because I will it. and man, I know your story. but I never watch tv..</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. that city blue that you once knew. means all the world to me</segment2>
		<segment3>the vacuum you percieved so small. is really never-ending. you would have known if you'd recall. the message I've been sending. and man, I know your story. but my heart just breaks in three..</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. the city blue that you once knew. means all the world to me.     </segment4>
