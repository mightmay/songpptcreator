		<segment1>Life begins when the secrets end and I don't touch you anymore. Oh, life begins when the secrets end and I don't touch you anymore. Without a witness to bear the worst of your wear. Try and take hold of the pretense. And when you're already here, trying to steer, watch it pass by at the onset. Examination brings the truth, eliminate what's wrong with you</segment1>
		<segment2>Life begins when the secrets end and I don't touch you anymore. Examination brings the truth, eliminate what's wrong with you</segment2>
		<segment3>It was a never ending fall I knew, I wouldn't lift my head, but never could I mend it all. And leaning only on my love for you, it never was enough,cause I never loved myself like you. I couldn't let me hurt you anymore. I couldn't let me hurt myself much more</segment3>
		<segment4>Examination brings the truth, eliminate what's wrong with you. Examination brings the truth (I couldn't let me hurt you anymore). Eliminate what's wrong with you (I couldn't let me hurt myself much more)	    </segment4>
