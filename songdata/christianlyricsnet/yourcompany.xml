		<segment1>Come on. I wanna love, I wish you'd turn me around. When you climbed up the trees. Because of kicks in the knees. That's all. And I know that's not what life's all about. When you hid in the leaves. And got stung by the bees</segment1>
		<segment2>Come on and be with me. I want your company</segment2>
		<segment3>Come on. I wanna love, I wish you'd turn me around. You know what we need. I know how to read</segment3>
		<segment4>Come on and be with me. I want your company    </segment4>
