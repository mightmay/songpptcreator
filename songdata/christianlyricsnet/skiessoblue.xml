		<segment1>Whoa...</segment1>
		<segment2>Man I just saw something. I'm glad that you are here. I got to start to thinking. And seeing things so clear. Cause now how could I forget. What she left. What happened in November. Is what I needed. And I'm sorry, that it shows. But life ain't so bad you know.</segment2>
		<segment3>Now the skies such a sweet blue. You made this come true. My heart feels so new, whoa.. Its now wonderful to. See beautiful views. Like skies that are so blue, whoa, whoa!. I'll never leave us you know!</segment3>
		<segment4>I turn it off for this. Looks like we got what we wished. It snowed in Texas, but you missed (the 1st time since '86). And I can't stop thinking of how wonderful this is. And I'm sorry, I sound glad, but why always be so sad?</segment4>
		<segment5>Now the skies such a sweet blue. You made this come true. My heart feels so new, whoa.. Its now wonderful to. See beautiful views. Like skies that are so blue, whoa, whoa!</segment5>
		<segment6>Ba Ba Ba Ba... Ba Ba Ba Ba..</segment6>
		<segment7>And I know that sometimes oh I might feel alone, so broken, cold. Now I'll show that I know that</segment7>
		<segment8>The skies such a sweet blue. You made this come true. My heart feels so new, whoa.. Its now wonderful to. See beautiful views. Like skies that are so blue, whoa, whoa!. I'll never leave us you know, whoa!.     </segment8>
