		<segment1>(Verse 1). In the end when all of this is gone. And all that's living has moved on. The sun and moon will finally set. The wind will lay the seas to rest</segment1>
		<segment2>In the end when all our souls will rise. All the nations, all the sides. Will feel the need for that dark place. For I and thee in His embrace</segment2>
		<segment3>In His shadow there is peace. In His arms there is rest. In His word there is hope. In His hands there is grace</segment3>
		<segment4>In the end, no hurting. In the end, no yearning. In the end, no suffering. No sadness or pain. In the end</segment4>
		<segment5>(Verse 2). To the end when all of this is gone. And all that's living has moved on. The sun and moon will rise and set. The wind will bring the seas to rest</segment5>
		<segment6>To the end when all our souls will rise. All the nations, all the sides. Will feel the need for this dark place. For I am loved and this is His embrace</segment6>
		<segment7>In His shadow there is peace. In His arms there is rest. In His word there is hope. In His hands there is grace</segment7>
		<segment8>To the end, there's hurting. To the end, there's yearning. To the end, there's suffering. You're waiting and waiting</segment8>
		<segment9>Oh to the end.. Oh to the end..</segment9>
		<segment10>(Closing). When it's dark. Souls will shine. When it's dark. We will rise</segment10>
		<segment11>We were made to live forever.. We were made to live forever..</segment11>
		<segment12>We will live to live forever.. We will live to live forever..</segment12>
