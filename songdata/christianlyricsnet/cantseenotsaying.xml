		<segment1>It's been so long, I feel so out of touch. Thoughts cloud my heart and head. I think I think too much. The narrow path I follow, is it the right way?. I keep on dwelling in tomorrow. I should be living in today!. I'm having trouble with my thought process. And I'm no engineer. All the road to my brains are there. And the directions just aren't clear. I can't sit back and let all of this go. Want you to feel what I feel and to know what I know. I can't see not saying what's on my mind. Are all things meaningless and a waste of time?.     </segment1>
