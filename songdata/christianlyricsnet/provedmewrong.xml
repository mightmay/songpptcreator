		<segment1>A softer kind of smile. A star that holds your stare. Everything I've ever known just blew up in the air. Don't you hate it when every love song makes sense to you?. and time away breaks your heart in two. I really hate it now. They should have taught us this in school. I really thought I was so cool. You proved me wrong again. I can't wait til' the next time I see you. it's getting hard to sleep at night. I'll pretend that it's alright. It doesn't feel that way. By now you probably hate this song. It's probably best that it's not long. I guess you proved me wrong. I can't wait til' the next time I see you.     </segment1>
