		<segment1>I gaze into my eyes. I wander what my future holds for me in You. I pray all day and night. That I would do just what You want me to. I will live my life for You</segment1>
		<segment2>Just to please You, Father. Is my one desire. It burns in me. Like a blazing fire</segment2>
		<segment3>Things may come my way. That will try to make me loose my sight of You. But I will stand strong. To what I know is good and true. I will live my life for You. For the rest of my days</segment3>
		<segment4>Just to please You, Father. Is my one desire. It burns in me. Like a blazing fire. to preach the gospel to the nation. to every tongue and every race. and Lord, just to please You.     </segment4>
