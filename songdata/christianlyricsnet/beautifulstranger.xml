		<segment1>Do you see me?. The questions in her eyes. Do you relate to the pain I cant disguise?. Oh, look beyond what you see. The outside is not all there is</segment1>
		<segment2>Wont You tell me now when did I see. You in need of water?. Oh, and tell me now, when did I see You. Hungry on the street?. God, I hear You calling out to me. In the voices of the least of these. Calling me to reach beyond my world. To the beautiful stranger. Beautiful Stranger</segment2>
		<segment3>He does not look like everyone else. Does not fit in anywhere I know. You ask me to be Your hands. And show him now that he is loved</segment3>
		<segment4>Theres beauty that lies deep within. Waiting to be discovered. God help me see what You see. The diamond in the stone</segment4>
