		<segment1>Mister, here's a story. Bartender, please!. Set me up another, 'Cause I'm here to bleed. Been down in the dungeons. Been high on the plains. Been everywhere but home-. I'll not return again.</segment1>
		<segment2>How can you lose what was never there?. I know, I know - I don't care. You said the words were more than you could bear. I know, I know - I just don't care.</segment2>
		<segment3>Someone play that sad song!. Cohen knows my name. The two of us - and you, Bartender. Play that song again!</segment3>
		<segment4>Mr. Cohen and me, and you, Bartender. Tender bartender.    </segment4>
