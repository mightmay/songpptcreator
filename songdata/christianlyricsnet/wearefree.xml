		<segment1>We are more than conquerors. We don't have to be afraid. Nothing is as powerful. As His love</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh the way He gave His son. To give life to everyone. Not a thing can separate us. From His love</segment2>
		<segment3>Its the life and the hope that He brings. His forgiveness that leads us to sing</segment3>
		<segment4>We are free to love. Like our God has loved. We are free to give like He gave. We are free from sin. We are free to begin. To forgive as He forgave. We are free</segment4>
		<segment5>We are living evidence. He restores our innocence. Jesus stands in our defense. All for love</segment5>
		<segment6>Its the grace and the peace that He brings. His forgiveness that leads us to sing</segment6>
		<segment7>Nothing can separate us. Nothing can separate us, Lord. Nothing can ever take us from You    </segment7>
