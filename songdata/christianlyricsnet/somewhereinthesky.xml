		<segment1>Another beautiful morning. The sun seems a little brighter today. It's my reward for stepping into the moment as I am seizing the day </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. I'm soaring now somewhere in the sky. The rush of air never wanting to come down. There's nothing that I've ever felt like learning how to fly. I'm learning how to fly </segment2>
		<segment3>The freedom to be in the moment. The reason for making a memory. Never wasting all that comes my way as I take in what I see </segment3>
		<segment4>I thank God for our freedom. There's nothing wrong with enjoying things in life. Spread the word that a smile's not beyond us. This is a call to act and seize your day.     </segment4>
