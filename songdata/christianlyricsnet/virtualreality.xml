		<segment1>I may never get it right. You might find I fall away. I can't live the perfect life. Every hour everyday. I may stumble, You may see. A side you never knew of me. I don't want to let You down. But I cannot make the guarantee. That I could love you like You Love me 'til the end of time. It drives me crazy thinking why You want me by Your side. Chorus. I know that I'm not dreaming. Is my mind playing tricks on me. No, Your love won't let me believe in virtual reality. It's beyond imagination, Your love changes everything. I know in my heart this ain't no virtual reality </segment1>
		<segment2>I may never understand. Lord, my mind is so amazed. I can't really comprehend. I'm entranced, blown away. But what I feel inside my heart. Isn't always what I see. Funny how your faith can change Your virtual reality. Seems too easy to believe You'd love me as I am But this reality will keep my heart here in Your hands </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus    </segment3>
