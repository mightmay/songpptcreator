		<segment1>This is the moment, this is the new year. This is my life now, this me waking up. Cause I was sleeping, just barely breathing. Until you found me, until yu picked me up. And game me something to believe in. Your love is everything I've ever needed</segment1>
		<segment2>You're what I live for, when my hope is shattered. (Yeah) You're what I live for, when everything is closing in on me. You're what I live for</segment2>
		<segment3>Used to be empty, I was a cynic. Drank in the darkness. This is me giving up all of the history, all of the old me. Because you changed me. Because you filled me up, and gave me something I could call my own. Your love is everything you are my home</segment3>
		<segment4>The only thing. The only thing worth living for. Be my everything    </segment4>
