		<segment1>Ive been here a thousand times before.. Face down on the floor. Wondering how I even reached this place again</segment1>
		<segment2>[PRECHORUS]. But youve shown so endlessly, How your love pours over me, No picture can re-create the beauty that I see</segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS]. Show me what it means, To live my life a sacrifice, If only I would realize how much. It took to pay the price, I know Id always give, Everything to you </segment3>
		<segment4>I want this world to always see. Your perfect majesty, Reflecting from my life this brilliant poetry</segment4>
		<segment5>[PRECHORUS]. Written all over this place, The signs of all creation that you breathed, Words cant even state how much you mean to me </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to face my very crime, Of not always giving all of mine, But I can feel the hope you bring to me</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS.     </segment8>
