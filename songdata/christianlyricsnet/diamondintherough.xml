		<segment1>As a little girl I came down to the water. With a little stone in my hand. And it would shimmer and sing. And I knew everything. As a little girl I came down</segment1>
		<segment2>In a little while I got steeped in authority. Heaven only knows what when wrong. When there is nothing so cruel. Than to bury that jewel when it was mine all along. And I'm gonna find it </segment2>
		<segment3>You're shining, I can see you. You're smiling, that's enough well. I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough. Like a diamond in the rough </segment3>
		<segment4>Ever now and then I can see that I am getting somewhere. Where I have to go is so deep. I was angry back then, and you know I still am. I have lost too much sleep and I'm gonna find it </segment4>
		<segment5>You're shining, I can see you. You're smiling, that's enough well. I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough. Like a diamond in the rough </segment5>
		<segment6>Snake's in the grass better step on the gas (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>In my dreams I go down by the water. With a little girl in my arms and we shimmer and sing. And we know everything. In my dreams I go down, down. I go down</segment7>
		<segment8>You're shining, I can see you. You're smiling, that's enough well. I'm holding onto you, like a diamond in the rough. Like a diamond in the rough. Yeah, like a diamond in the rough</segment8>
