		<segment1>We bow our hearts we lift our hands. we turn our eyes to you again. And we surrender to the truth. that all we need is found in You. Receive our adoration. Jesus lamb of God. Receive our adoration. how wonderful you are. We choose to leave it all behind. and turn our eyes towards the prize. the upward call of God in Christ. you have our hearts Lord take our lives. Receive our adoration Jesus lamb of God. Receive our adoration how wonderful you are. Every soul you´ve saved sings out. everything you´ve made resounds. all creation´s standing now. lifting up your name. We´re we´re joining in the angel´s song. we´re gathered to your ancient throne. children in our Father´s arms. shouting out your praise.     </segment1>
