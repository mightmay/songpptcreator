		<segment1>You're my day, you're my light. You're the star in the darkest night. When I hear your voice. I know everything's alright. Don't let go of my hand. Clear my mind make me understand. Plant my feet on the rock of your love. All else is sinking sand. There's no other name above my Name. There's no other King under heaven. Nothin else in this world can give me life. Give me life</segment1>
		<segment2>You're Lord, you're King. You're everything, you are lovely. You're Lord, you're King. You're everything. You are all my life. You're all my life</segment2>
		<segment3>You're my hopes, you're my dreams. You're my borders, you're my extremes. You are the past, you're the future. And all the other time in between. You're the note on the page. The music ringing down through the age. You sang a melody that moved me. The echos never fade. There's no other name above His Name. There's no other King under heaven. Nothin else in this world can give you life. Give you life. He'll give you life</segment3>
		<segment4>You're Lord, you're King. You're everything, you are lovely. You're Lord, you're King. You are all my life. You're all my life..</segment4>
