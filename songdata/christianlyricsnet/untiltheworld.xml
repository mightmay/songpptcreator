		<segment1>I lose myself to find in me. The way it really ought to be. It's hard to say I love you. It's hard to say I need you. If all is well it's hard to tell. It hurts to think of someone else. It's hard to say I'll be there. It's hard to say I really, really care</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Until the world won't turn. 'Till the planets burn. Until the sun dies I'll be there. Until the heavens come. 'Til this lie is done. Until the world dies I'll be there</segment2>
		<segment3>I can't see outside myself. How can I love for someone else. It's hard to say I'm sorry. It's hard to say forgive me. I can't believe you're here with me. Into the future I can't see. It's hard to say forever. It's hard to say I'll never ever go</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)    </segment4>
