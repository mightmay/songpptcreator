		<segment1>Hopeless. A single word that you would not expect from me, from me. I take it like it's coming from an enemy. The scene was meant to be. I see it coming after all the worst of me would fall. Make this now or never</segment1>
		<segment2>See it on my face I'm getting over you. Make this now or never. I'm getting over you. The place it takes me now. Well is it far enough. I'm getting over you. Make this now or never</segment2>
		<segment3>Countless. The moments I would kill to keep this day away, away. I see it coming after all the worst of me would fall. I take it like it's coming from my greatest enemy. Make this now or never</segment3>
		<segment4>See it on my face I'm getting over you. Make this now or never. I'm getting over you. The place it takes me now. Well is it far enough. I'm getting over you. Make this now or never</segment4>
		<segment5>Hopeless. I don't have to take this. Countless. See it on my face. Getting over you. Oohh oh oh oh, getting over you</segment5>
		<segment6>See it on my face. I'm getting over you. Make this now or never. I'm getting over you. The place it takes me now. Well is it far enough. I'm getting over you. Make this now or never</segment6>
		<segment7>Hopeless. I don't have to take this. Make this now or never. Countless. See it on my face. I'm getting over you. Make this now or never    </segment7>
