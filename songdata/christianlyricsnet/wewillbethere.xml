		<segment1>Time has come. Time is now. To break away from. From the crowd. Rise up, be strong. Come along</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. We will run, never stop. Till weve given all weve got. Through the fields through the fire. Till we hit the final wire. By His power we will make it</segment2>
		<segment3>We will be there. We will be there. When you fall down. Think youre through. And sin has taken. The best of you. Fall into grace and rise a new</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>We will sing this melody. Till we stand in victory. We will love we will give. We will run and we will live    </segment5>
