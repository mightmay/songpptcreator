		<segment1>And have you call me out my name. Don't take my heart. And tear it apart. (Chorus). For I am God's blessing. And I am your gift sent from above. I was made for you to love me. And I am here for you. (For you to love). For you to love. And remember this, I am the same woman. You prayed for. I'll hold your hand. And make your life worthwhile. How can you hold me. Then abuse me boy. (How could you). When I am the mother of your child. (Chorus). I'm standing here to give you what you need. (To give you what you need). But if you can't love Him you can't love me. (Chorus). For you to love. For you to love. For you to love me. I am blessing. God's blessing. Let's stay in love. Let's pray together. Let's stay together. So we can stay together. (Chorus)    </segment1>
