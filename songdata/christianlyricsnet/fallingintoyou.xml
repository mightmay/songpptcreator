		<segment1>Here I am, is it too late?. When all I've known has been misplaced. Hold me close, don't ever let me go. You come to me like a summer's breeze. Now I've fallen on my knees. Hold me close, don't ever let me go. Don't let me go. Don't let me go </segment1>
		<segment2>All this time I'm falling into you. All this time I'm falling into you </segment2>
		<segment3>I'll climb across, I won't look down. So afraid to hit the ground. Could you really catch me when I fall?. When I fall, when I fall     </segment3>
