		<segment1>Sometimes it is hard to go on. Its hard to see the reasons. For breathing, living, letting love guide the way. But you must hold on</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Don't give up. Don't give up. Hold on for one more day (2x)</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes we fall down. We get ourselves in trouble. But it's okay. Cause we still have another chance to get it right. To get it right</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Don't give up. Don't give up. Hold on for one more day (2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>I've come too far. I've seen so much. I've heard the call and felt the touch. I've tasted love that I cannot deny (2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus. Don't give up. Don't give up. Hold on for one more day (2x)    </segment6>
