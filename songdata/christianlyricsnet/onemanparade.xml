		<segment1>Behold the man without stregth. The strongest man that ever lived. Behold the end of all things. The end of all things just beginning. The weak are marching on with one objective. Take back the times. These days are evil. No one can stop them. The dead rise up to praise You. Your love goes far beyond the grave. It's life or death. Now make your choice. Whose side are you on?    </segment1>
