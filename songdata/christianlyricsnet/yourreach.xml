		<segment1>Cold as the sun on a winter's morning. Your resolve still lies shivering. A heap of ill-sighted plans. So you think, so it shall be. Dwelling on all that's happened now. Since that day you were lucid. And saw things all too clear. It was easy, now it's grown dark</segment1>
		<segment2>But even though the wood surrounds you. It doesn't mean your heart should fail you. Now when the end. Is just within your reach</segment2>
		<segment3>Pushing you up against the wall. You feel there's no one. To cushion you from the fall. You stumble. Spending all your strength in vain. Holding onto the cherished notion. That things were different back then. You lapse into the old you. With all you see before your eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>But even though the wood surrounds you. It doesn't mean your heart should fail you. Now when the end. Is just within your reach</segment4>
		<segment5>Take it easy, chill, chill, chill. You've got a penchant for. Pulling through these things. It's alright, it's ok. Take it easy, chill, chill, chill. You've got a penchant for. Pulling through these things. It's alright, it's ok. It's ok, it's alright</segment5>
		<segment6>But even though the wood surrounds you. It doesn't mean your heart should fail you. Now when the end. Is just within your reach</segment6>
		<segment7>It's alright.     </segment7>
