		<segment1>Diety's blood, spilled for you. For indeed Christ was our passover. Hanging on a bloodied cross. A bloodied cross</segment1>
		<segment2>Human sacrifice. Human sacrifice</segment2>
		<segment3>Father forgive them for they know not what they do. Peter denied three times. They draw near to me with their mouth but their hearts. Are far from me</segment3>
		<segment4>Human sacrifice. Human sacrifice</segment4>
		<segment5>Do not be afraid for He is risen. All authority has been given to Him. Worship Him, and only Him. Jesus Christ, the Almighty</segment5>
		<segment6>He was your human sacrifice</segment6>
		<segment7>Jesus said, this is the blood of the new covenant. Shed for the remission of sins. That it might be fulfilled. Which was spoken by the prophets    </segment7>
