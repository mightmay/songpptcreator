		<segment1>I want to set. The story straight. It's time to tell. The truth</segment1>
		<segment2>I never could. Have come so far. If it were not. For You</segment2>
		<segment3>You covered up my sin. You covered up my silence. You covered up my shame. You made me new again</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: It's all because of You..</segment4>
		<segment5>They tell me to. Abandon You. To make my dreams. Come true</segment5>
		<segment6>So what am I. Supposed to do?. I only dream. Of You</segment6>
		<segment7>You covered up my sin. You covered up my silence. You covered up my shame. I am new again</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
