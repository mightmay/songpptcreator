		<segment1>[Verse 1:]. Beautiful God. Laying Your majesty aside. You reached out in love to show me life. Lifted from darkness into light. Oh</segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse 2:]. King for a slave. Trading Your righteousness for shame. Despite all my pride and foolish ways. Caught in Your infinite embrace. Oh</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus 1:]. And I find myself here on my knees again. Caught up in grace like an avalanche. Nothing compares to this love love love. Burning in my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 3:]. Saviour and Friend. Breathing Your life into my heart. Your word is the lamp unto my path. Forever I'm humbled by Your love. Oh</segment4>
		<segment5>[Bridge:]. Take my life. Take all that I am. With all that I am I will love You. Take my heart. Take all that I have. Jesus how I adore You</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus 2:]. And I find myself here on my knees again. Caught up in grace like an avalanche. Nothing compare to this love love love.     </segment6>
