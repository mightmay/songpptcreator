		<segment1>I waited for you today. But you didn't show. No no. I needed you today. So where did you go?. You told me to call. Said you'd be there. And though I haven't seen you. Are you still there?</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I cried out with no reply. And I can't feel you by my side. So I'll hold tight to what I know. You're here and I'm never alone</segment2>
		<segment3>And though I cannot see you. And I can't explain why. Such a deep reassurance. You've placed in my life. We cannot separate. 'Cause you're part of me. And though you're invisible. I'll trust the unseen.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
