		<segment1>Well, it all comes down to this-. nothing else to bother me. and no one else around. I'm searching for Your kiss, running back into Your arms, and facing toward the ground.</segment1>
		<segment2>With the beating of my heart. and the tears rolling down -(oh yeah). all I'm looking for now. is the peace and joy that I once knew</segment2>
		<segment3>Because it's You -. You are the one. and it's You -. giving light to the Sun. and it's You -. You are always unto -. yeah it's You.</segment3>
		<segment4>Well, I know sometimes it seems. I'm losing track of time with you. and everything's so clear. Well, like a bird I'm free. Noticing your love for me. never far, but near.</segment4>
		<segment5>So I'm still looking for, trying hard not to look back. I know I'll never get bored. with the love and joy I find in You</segment5>
		<segment6>Because it's You -. You are the one. and it's You -. giving light to the Sun. and it's You -. You are always unto -. yeah it's You.</segment6>
		<segment7>I know it's You -. You are the one. and it's You -. giving light to the Sun. and its You -. You are always unto -. yeah it's You.</segment7>
		<segment8>Nothing else compares to You. You are the life You are the truth. Nothing else compares to You. take me back where I once knew.</segment8>
		<segment9>Nothing else compares to You. You are the life You are the truth. Nothing else compares to You. Take me back where I once knew.</segment9>
		<segment10>Nothing else compares to You. You are the life, You are the truth. Nothing else compares to You. Take me back where I once knew</segment10>
		<segment11>It's a song of love.     </segment11>
