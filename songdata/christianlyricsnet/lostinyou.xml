		<segment1>You said, If I lost all I have. I'd gain new life instead. How perfect are Your ways. They are higher than mine. To the oceans to the skies. Love so amazing. Your word contradicts the world. Your voice calls me deeper still</segment1>
		<segment2>Take my life, all my plans. I lay everything in Your hands. I lay everything Jesus. If I had one prayer. It would be to get lost in You. Nothing else, when lost in You I find myself</segment2>
		<segment3>To think that You'd be jealous for me. You're the maker of the stars and seas. How wonderful Your love. I'm captured by You God. How beautiful You are</segment3>
		<segment4>Take my life, all my plans. I lay everything in Your hands. I lay everything Jesus. If I had one prayer. It would be to get lost in You. Nothing else, when lost in You </segment4>
		<segment5>Every heartbeat beat for You. Every breath I breathe for You. I give myself away. Every heartbeat beat for You. Every breath I breathe for You. My heart is Yours today</segment5>
		<segment6>Take my life, all my plans. I lay everything in Your hands. Everything Jesus</segment6>
		<segment7>Take my life, all my plans. I lay everything in Your hands. I lay everything Jesus. If I had one prayer. It would be to get lost in You. Nothing else, when lost in You. I find myself. I find myself    </segment7>
