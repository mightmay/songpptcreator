		<segment1>Your love, oh God. Displayed for us. As crimson covered. Over sinless hands. Your majesty. For all to see. In raging storms and quiet cloudless days</segment1>
		<segment2>Beautiful Jesus. Beautiful Savior. Nothing is greater, briliant Creator. Friend of mine</segment2>
		<segment3>You're powerful. Above this world. The universe is under your command</segment3>
		<segment4>Your glory shines. A holy light. That leads our hearts to praise. Your holy name is on our lips</segment4>
		<segment5>Beautiful Jesus. Beautiful Savior. Nothing is greater, briliant Creator. Friend of mine. Perfect in power. Matchless in glory. Nothing is greater, brilliant Creator. Friend of mine</segment5>
		<segment6>My lips will sing. My heart will bring. Praise to you, the holy King. My lips will sing. My heart will bring. Praise to you, holy!    </segment6>
