		<segment1>I see you standing here. But you're so far away. Starving for your attention. You don't even know my name. You're going through so much. But I know that I could be the one to hold you</segment1>
		<segment2>Every single day I find it hard to say. I could be yours alone. You will see someday. That all along the way. I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold</segment2>
		<segment3>I see you walking by. Your hair always hiding your face. I wonder why you've been hurting. I wish I had some way to say. You're going through so much. Don't you know that I could be the one to hold you</segment3>
		<segment4>Every single day I find it hard to say. I could be yours alone. You will see someday. That all along the way. I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm stretching but you're just out of reach. You should know. I'm ready when you're ready for me. And I'm waiting for the right time. For the day I catch your eye. To let you know. That I'm yours to hold</segment5>
		<segment6>Every single day I find it hard to say. I could be yours alone. You will see someday. That all along the way. I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold</segment6>
		<segment7>Every single day I find it hard to say. I could be yours alone (you're so far away). You will see someday. That all along the way. I was yours to hold, I was yours to hold</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm stretching but you're just out of reach. I'm ready when you're ready for me    </segment8>
