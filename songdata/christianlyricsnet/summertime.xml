		<segment1>I want to play all day. and swim out in the waves. in a lagoon that has no shark to bite my legs. a perfect place. where we can all laugh out loud. with palm trees, an ocean breeze. and never any clouds. get away. far away. to a place. I can stay </segment1>
		<segment2>feels like summertime. the sun is shining on my face. feels like summertime. I never want to leave this place. but if I can't go now. I know someday, somehow. I know you've got a place. designed for me someday. I've got a mansion there. a royal getaway. and when my work is done. you'll fly me there at last. a place that doesn't take credit cards. or lots of cash. but if I can't go now. I know someday, somehow. you will take me there. cast away my burdens. take away my cares     </segment2>
