		<segment1>love unfailing. overtaking my heart. you take me in, finding peace again. fear is lost in all you are. and I would give the world. to tell your story. 'cause I know that you've called me. I know that you've called me.. I've lost myself for good. within your promise. and I wont hide it.. I wont hide it. Jesus,I believe in you. and I would go, to the ends of the earth. to the ends of the earth. for you, alone are the son of God.. and all the world will see. that you are God.. that you are God..     </segment1>
