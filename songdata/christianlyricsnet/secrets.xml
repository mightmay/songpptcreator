		<segment1>I once was lost in a foaming, roaming, rabid sea. then blooms blossomed, changed my outlook. now I've been set free. I once was sinking in a quarry of quicksand. somebody noticed and they offered me a hand. I want to tell it, I want to say it, I want to show it, want you to know it </segment1>
		<segment2>I've got a secret. and I cannot keep it. I've got a secret. and I cannot keep it </segment2>
		<segment3>There is a God and He's alive and He treats me well. that is the secret Mrs. Mademoiselle </segment3>
		<segment4>I want to tell it, I want to say it, I want to show it, I want you to know it </segment4>
		<segment5>I've got a secret to the universe. Until you hear it you can't know what it's worth     </segment5>
