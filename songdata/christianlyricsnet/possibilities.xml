		<segment1>Remember the day when we ran away. And we saw the world for the first time?. We drove through the night to those big city lights. And we knew that we could do anything. Could do anything, anything, anything at all</segment1>
		<segment2>We don't have to live memories. Time can turn our dreams to reality. Oh, the possibilities</segment2>
		<segment3>Now is the time to make up our minds. And live like this is the last day. That we have a chance to put it on the line. And run away to the best time of our lives</segment3>
		<segment4>Because I still believe that we can do anything</segment4>
		<segment5>Walk through the doorway to the great unknown. This is the moment.     </segment5>
