		<segment1>Well I know there have been many who have hurt you. And I know your hearts been broken many times. How I wish that I could say Ive never let you down. But I know Im one of those whos made you cry. Still in the whole wide world theres no one else who will ever. Want to love you any better</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I will be the only one to love you for everything you are. I will be the only one to really know you and all your glory. I will be the one to see everything youre gonna be. I will be the only one to bring out the miracle in you</segment2>
		<segment3>Like a masterpiece thats waiting to be discovered. Like a treasure that is waiting to be found. There is so much unseen beauty in the heart of you. And I want to be the one to bring it out. Cause in the whole wide world theres no one else who will ever. Want to love you any better</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: Im gonna be the one beside you. When the world is left behind you. You know Im gonna be the only one. Cause there is no one else who will ever. Want to love you any better. No one else who will ever. Want to love you any better</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus.     </segment5>
