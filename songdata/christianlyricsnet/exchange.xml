		<segment1>Revelation, unknowing has been taken. Why had I waited so long. Refrained for this love. Never open to the hope. He has. How could I reject this. He was calling my name. Searching for me. I always turned away. Not wanting to believe. I had a need for Him. Feeling this emptiness. Not knowing He could fill Drowning in my efforts to find comfort. I searched and strived for the answer. But every step I fell. And the earth crumbled under me. Now I found this rock. This stable place. The pain has gone away. I please my hope in no other. My heart, it cries. It toils inside me. Wanting all to have this life. Wishing all to know this love. But I'm reminded of my turning. Closing my eyes. Running the other way. But I've decided. I opened my eyes. To find more than I was looking for. My mind screams. Knowing this is for all. But not all want what I've found. Now I found this Rock. This stable place. The pain has gone away. I place my hope in no other. I opened my eyes. To find more than I was looking for. My mind screams. Knowing this is for all. But not all want what I've found. Now I found this Rock. This stable place. The pain has gone away I place my hope in no other.     </segment1>
