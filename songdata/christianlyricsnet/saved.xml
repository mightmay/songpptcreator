		<segment1>I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined. Stone-cold as I stepped out of the womb. By His grace I have been touched. By His word I have been healed. By His hand I've been delivered. By His spirit I've been sealed</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I've been saved by the blood of the Lamb. I'm saved by the blood of the Lamb. And I'm so glad. Yes, I'm so glad. Now I'm so glad (So glad). I want to thank you, Lord. I just want to thank you, Lord. Thank You, Lord (Thank You, Lord)</segment2>
		<segment3>By His truth I can be upright. By His strength I can endure. By His power I've been lifted. In His love I am secure. He bought me with a price. Freed me from the pit. Full of emptiness and wrath. And the fire that burns in it</segment3>
		<segment4>Nobody to rescue me. Nobody would dare. I was going down for the last time. But by His mercy I've been spared. Not by works. But by faith in Him who called. For so long I've been hindered. For so long I've been stalled    </segment4>
