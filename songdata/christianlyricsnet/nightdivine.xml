		<segment1>Jump ship or just cast the anchor!. We're here to fight and we won't back down. Some say that we're all one killer. You won't know till you see our route. I'll rest when you see what's real. And time tests your vision of truth. It's some kind of feeling that sings I'm in love. Let's somehow embrace it as we all die young </segment1>
		<segment2>Oh night divine, we're falling away. Oh night divine, this world's a phase. And we will fade away </segment2>
		<segment3>Crash course till you find the answer. The lights dim and we waste our time. They say that we heal much faster. Well, just wait and enjoy the ride. Reach for the strength that is real!. Love changes all that you feel </segment3>
		<segment4>Oh night divine, we're falling away. Oh night divine, this world's a phase. And we will fade away. As time slips by we're dying young. Cut down to size, the room is dark. And I can't find a way </segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, you can move me (die young). Yeah, you can move me, move me. Yeah, you can own me (die young). Yeah, you can own me, own me    </segment5>
