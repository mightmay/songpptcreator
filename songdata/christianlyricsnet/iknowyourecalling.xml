		<segment1>A broken image is sometimes what i see. But the hand that made me is the hand that won't leave me. You've begun a good work that only has begun. And you always lead me, lead me to your son. What i want to know everything you are. What i want to see your will for me and i know you'll show me </segment1>
		<segment2>And i know you're calling, I see your arms stretched wide. And i feel you drawing, drawing me back again </segment2>
		<segment3>Another day I can spend with you. You turn the pages telling me what to do. And when i feel like i want to fall again. You always lead me well you lead me to your hand. Oh what i want to know everythign you are. What i want to see your will for me. And i know you'll show me </segment3>
		<segment4>And i know i want everything that you want for me. Help me to understand your ways. I know i want that you want for me today    </segment4>
