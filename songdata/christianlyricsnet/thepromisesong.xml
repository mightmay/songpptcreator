		<segment1>Oh if you keep my word, I'll make you as a tree, Planted by the streams of life, If you'll submit to me.</segment1>
		<segment2>And if you love the hateful ones, Who mistreat you constantly, The book of life shall bear your name, If you love your enemies.</segment2>
		<segment3>Yes, lord jesus. Yes, lord jesus.</segment3>
		<segment4>And if you do my will, I'll make you living stones, To build up in my father's house, If you serve me alone.</segment4>
		<segment5>And if you love all men, Especially the least, I'll raise you up, the lowest ones, And make you kings and priests.</segment5>
		<segment6>Yes, lord jesus. Yes, lord jesus.</segment6>
		<segment7>And if you'll seek my face, And set your life apart, I'll let myself be found by you, When you search with all your heart.</segment7>
		<segment8>And if you never turn aside, To the left or to the right, I'll be a lamp unto your feet, And keep you on the path of light.</segment8>
		<segment9>Yes lord jesus, Yes lord jesus</segment9>
		<segment10>Yes lord jesus, Yes lord jesus    </segment10>
