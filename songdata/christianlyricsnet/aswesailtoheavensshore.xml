		<segment1>Storms may rise on seas unknown. While we journey towards our home. Surely we'll learn what grace if for. As we sail to heaven's shore</segment1>
		<segment2>Send us strength O pilgrim guide. Sin would drown us in its tide. Be close at hand and go before. As we sail to heaven's shore</segment2>
		<segment3>Holy Spirit lead us on. Give us courage bring the song</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord we trust Your Father's care. Will convey us safely there. Open or seal off every door. As we sail to heaven's shore</segment4>
		<segment5>Straighten our course with every prayer. Let heaven's breezes speed us there. And grant us mercy evermore. As we sail to heaven's shore</segment5>
		<segment6>Draw us near O finest Friend. From dawn's light to evening's end. Each passing day we love You more. As we sail to heaven's shore. As we sail to heaven's shore    </segment6>
