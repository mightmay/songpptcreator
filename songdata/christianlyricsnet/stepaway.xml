		<segment1>I take the time to understand. That life is just a living men. And so I realize what I must be do. I set my flesh aside. I let you through and I see all the works you do. I love you, Lord and I don't say it enough. So I just want to give my life to you. I step away from myself. We are here together, like we've been once before, But this time there's something different. You let Jesus through the door.. Step away from myself..    </segment1>
