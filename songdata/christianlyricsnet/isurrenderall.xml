		<segment1>i surrender all. to the promises you made. and i will give it all. to the maker of the day </segment1>
		<segment2>no one knows your heart. and no one knows your fears. when no one solves the mysteries. or even wipes away the tears </segment2>
		<segment3>can you hear the sound of laughter. from the other side of life?. there are days when i feel like a stranger sometimes. tell me, are there any other fools like me? </segment3>
		<segment4>this reliance on another world. has a great effect on this world. this conscience of another world. has a great effect on. grace recollection </segment4>
		<segment5>he doesn't love us 'cause of who we are. he only loves us 'cause of who he is </segment5>
		<segment6>we all were children once. so will we return. so let those days return. let us all return Â….     </segment6>
