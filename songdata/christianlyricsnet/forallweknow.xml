		<segment1>All that you thought you'd never have. You hold in your hands. All that you thought you'd never love. Iis right here above you. It's cruel </segment1>
		<segment2>All that you thought would disappear. Is waiting right here. And all that you hold deep in your soul. Can never be sold </segment2>
		<segment3>For all we know, these days are all numbered, But things could get better I know, Cause I'll be the first and the last one to go, Lord it's a cruel, cruel world. For all we know, These days are all numbered. And things will get better I hope, Cause I'll be the first and the last one to go, Lord it's a cruel, cruel world without love </segment3>
		<segment4>It's a cruel, cruel world without love.     </segment4>
