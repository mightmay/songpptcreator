		<segment1>In the midst of my darkest hour you see my tear-stained face. This broken form that no longer feels power with no apparent place. But even when this world has turned her back on me. When it's cold where it once had burned. When my thoughts are frightening. You will never leave me. When I fail at living and loving when I fail you Lord. I want things that I know very well I cannot afford. When I feel like I have no purpose except to live and die. Or all they tell me is that I'm worthless why even try. (Bridge). I cannot be sure of my love for you. But in the midst of my doubt..you are true    </segment1>
