		<segment1>I know it's forthright, to tell you now this way. Just what the Bible says and leave no shadows gray. For all the time I'm here I will and pull back not a punch. I know that deep inside you, you've got this nagging hunch</segment1>
		<segment2>Whether we're for real and if we mean what we say. Let me put to rest your wonder, we stand behind the way. And if you don't believe it, just come talk to us yourself. You ask &quot;just what you doin'?&quot;. Calling you from the fire</segment2>
		<segment3>The Bible teaches when you're saved you have new love and hates. If you do not then, you may well not be saved. Cause if you turn to Proverbs, chapter 8 and verse 13. There will be no question here, just as to what I mean</segment3>
		<segment4>There is a certain notion that soon you will get. Hating the hell out of evil and loving people yet. And when you understand this, you will see what we're about. About pride and arrogance, soon you will have no doubt</segment4>
		<segment5>Why I love hating evil. Evil pulls and tugs at you and says if you have more. Then you'll be satisfied: a lie to the core. It'll only rip you off then it'll make you pay. I've seen it all before, and man, it's hurt so any</segment5>
		<segment6>So if you claim to be a Christian. Show it with your life. And do not advocate. Rebellion, filth, and lies.     </segment6>
