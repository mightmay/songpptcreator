		<segment1>I know you. I know who you are. I'm through with your games. I know you. I know who you are. I'm through with your games. And ever-changing. Ever-changing faces. Let go. Feel it leave your grip. And watch it vanish. In the distance. Watch it vanish. In the distance. Watch it vanish. Forget the voices you hear. They're nothing now. They never were. Forget the voices you hear. They're nothing now. They never were. It looks warped at first. Only because of the tears. But you can still recognize. The definition in my face. We will forever stay united. We won't back down. And we will not stop fighting. We may stand or fall. But we'll never know. Until we take a hand. We've been waiting for a lifetime. And the determination in our stride. And the strength. And the strength of our purpose. We have waited for a lifetime. We won't let us pass us by. We just need to stand united. Then we will conquer this together. The determination in our stride. The strength in our purpose </segment1>
