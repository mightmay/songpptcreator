		<segment1>They always said that lonesome town. Was where I'd spend my days. Cuz I just couldn't settle down. My life was such a craze</segment1>
		<segment2>They always said that Lonesome Town. Would finally get to me. But lonesome is the only way. That I truly feel free..eee</segment2>
		<segment3>Lonesome Town is crowded. And everyone's the same. With fresh new starts and broken hearts. Where no one knows your name. Though Lonesome Town is crowded. I'm always first in line. With fresh new starts for broken hearts. And wasting all my time</segment3>
		<segment4>Well Lonesome Town its got its good. Its sure enough got its bad. Like walkin' round that big dance floor. For the date you wish you had</segment4>
		<segment5>They always said that Lonesome Town. Would finally get to me. But lonesome is the only way. That I truly feel free..eee</segment5>
		<segment6>Well lonesome town is crowded. Where everyone's the same. With fresh new starts and broken hearts. Where no one knows your name. Though Lonesome Town is crowded. I'm always first in line. With fresh new starts for broken hearts. And wasting all my time</segment6>
		<segment7>You're either born to lose or you're born to win. That's just what I've found. But I've come to accept the fact. (Come to accept the fact). I've come to accept the fact. (Come to accept the fact). That's right I've come to accept the fact. That I was born in Lonesome Town    </segment7>
