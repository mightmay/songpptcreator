		<segment1>I talk, I talk too much. I never open up. To what You need to say. My words get in the way</segment1>
		<segment2>I search for stillness. But worry kills it. I need to clear my head. I'm tired, I need to rest</segment2>
		<segment3>It all comes down to this. The quiet in the end. I listen for Your voice. Recovery begins</segment3>
		<segment4>The times I hear You most. Are when You bring me close. I'll follow as You guide. While darkness turns to light</segment4>
		<segment5>Whisper to me, whisper to me. Whisper to me, whisper to me    </segment5>
