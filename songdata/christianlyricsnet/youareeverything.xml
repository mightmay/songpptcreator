		<segment1>Im the one with two left feet. Standing on a lonely street. I cant even walk a straight line. And every time you look at me. Im spinning like an autumn leaf. Bound to hit bottom sometime</segment1>
		<segment2>Where would I be without someone to save me?. Someone who wont let me fall</segment2>
		<segment3>You are everything that I live for. Everything that I cant believe is happening. Youre standing right in front of me. With arms wide open. All I know is every day is filled with hope. Cause You are everything that I breathe for. And I cant help but breathe You in, and breathe again. Feeling all this life within. Every single beat of my heart </segment3>
		<segment4>Im the one with big mistakes. Big regrets and bigger breaks. Than Id ever care to confess. But Youre the one who looks at me. And sees what I was meant to be. More than just a beautiful mess</segment4>
		<segment5>Youre everything good in my life. Everything honest and true. And all of those stars hangin up in the sky. Could never shine brighter than You    </segment5>
