		<segment1>A heart can break a thousand times before it finds. The love that makes it beat again. I've had my share of ups and downs in this whole life. Nothing compares. To this love. It's our love</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm at home when I'm with you. When you're with me worries fade away</segment2>
		<segment3>This world can take the very life right out of me. And leave me broken on my knees. Sometimes I feel like I just can't go on. But you restore me</segment3>
		<segment4>ItÂ’s your love. It's our love</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm at home when I'm with you. When you're with me worries fade away. I'm at home when I'm with you. When you're with me and in your arms I'll stay </segment5>
		<segment6>. I'll never find another. Closer than any other. It's you I love. It's you I love</segment6>
		<segment7>It's you I love. It's you I love. It's you I love    </segment7>
