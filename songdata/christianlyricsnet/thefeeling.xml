		<segment1>I feel like I can't stand still anymore. Are you with me?. You got a mic here's the band now get your feet off the floor</segment1>
		<segment2>I cannot run away. The feeling's gotta stay while we rock all night long (hey, hey, hey hey). I think that we all know. The reason that we show the world how real we are (hey, hey, hey hey)</segment2>
		<segment3>Turn it up feel the beat and scream the lyrics you know. Keep it coming. The time is right lets unite to the rock and roll. Everybody</segment3>
		<segment4>I cannot run away. The feeling's gotta stay while we rock all night long(hey, hey, hey hey). I think that we all know. The reason that we show the world how real we are (hey, hey, hey hey)</segment4>
		<segment5>There's a greater meaning. Beyond the music the music that we are bringing. Cuz tonight we are singing. And together we know</segment5>
		<segment6>We cannot run away. The feeling's gotta stay while we rock all night long (hey, hey, hey hey). I think that we all know. The reason that we show the world how real we are (hey, hey, hey hey). Hey. Yea! </segment6>
