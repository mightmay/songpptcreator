		<segment1>The blind leading the blind. Unfortunate misfortunes of my life. Tests and trials, Im in denial. Ending up face down in my own hands. The blind leading the blind. Finally having the strength to open up my eyes. Placing bets, my hearts turn to shine. Ending up face down in my own hands. Day after day I wait, theres nothing left but apathy. Time to kill, and you're not worth my time. Theyve got me facing back to back. Im failing but still picking up your slack. But still these pieces will not fit. A nervous wreck, and the worst gets worse. Time to kill, and you're still not worth a second of my time. Why are you fighting for your life when you're already dead?</segment1>
		<segment2>Day after day I wait, theres nothing left but apathy. Time to kill, and you're not worth my time. Excuse after excuse. They've got me facing back to back. Im failing but still picking up your slack. But still these pieces will not fit. Im a nervous wreck, and still the worst gets worse    </segment2>
