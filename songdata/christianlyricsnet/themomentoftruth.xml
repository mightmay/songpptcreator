		<segment1>You got your hand on the door. And you're ready to walk out. Well, the fight that you had filled your mind up with all this doubt. And you're losing your mind and losing your faith. And you can't remember why you fell in love in the first place</segment1>
		<segment2>Go back, go back to the moment of truth. When she walked down the aisle and you first said, &quot;I do&quot;. When this life makes you wonder what have you got to lose. Go back, go back to the moment of truth</segment2>
		<segment3>You got your hand on a habit. And you can't seem to let it go. It used to be your escape now it's out of control. And now it's you in the mirror. But you don't recognize your face. And you're looking for a reason not to throw it all away</segment3>
		<segment4>Just go back, go back. To the moment of truth. With three words, &quot;It's a girl&quot;. And she looks just like you. When this life makes you wonder what have you got to lose. Go back, just go back to the moment of truth</segment4>
		<segment5>You got your hand on the Bible. But your heart feels like stone. 'Cause you think that you've made too many mistakes to come home. And you're losing your will and you're losing your faith. And now you wonder if you even believed in the first place</segment5>
		<segment6>Just go back to the moment of truth. When you first talked to Jesus. And He reached out for you. He's still reaching, He's still reaching out for you. So when this life makes you wonder what have you got to lose. Just go back, just go back. To the moment of truth    </segment6>
