		<segment1>How's your head? I'm so sorry. That I can't do anything about it. Like I said, I'll be praying. Here without you I feel helpless</segment1>
		<segment2>Sorry I had to go away. Tomorrow's just another day. without you here, I'll have to say. Hold on to love</segment2>
		<segment3>How's your day? Do you miss me?. Right now I've only a minute. Called to say, I'm so sorry. And once again I feel helpless</segment3>
		<segment4>God forbid we'd be apart. How close or shall I ask how far. are we until the demise of this helplessness.     </segment4>
