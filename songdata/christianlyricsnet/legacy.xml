		<segment1>Oh the memories. Of all the things that shouldn't be. They take you away from all you should be. Don't let it go by as if you agree </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. Nightmares of the past will fade away. The future of your name is what will stay. Never try to blame the past for everything you say. You have the power you need to change your legacy</segment2>
		<segment3>Do you really want to be just like the very ones you blame who take you away from all you should be. Don't just stand by as if you agree. Think of the future and when you are gone how will you be remembered then. For all time you can be the one who changed the name.     </segment3>
