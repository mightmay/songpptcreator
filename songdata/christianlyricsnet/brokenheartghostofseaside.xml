		<segment1>In this moment synchronized inside, words that paint a legacy of life. a different picture will unfold, a healing finds it's way through. sifted times i take another break, with an ambience of nothing left. so heal my heart rain down your love. these waters bring me back to life</segment1>
		<segment2>father, healer, deliver me from broken love. stay here, closer let me hear your voice of love</segment2>
		<segment3>there's a healing calling from the wind, there's a healer waiting to begin. in timeless places, traced and faceless will I learn to let go. take me to the heights where love controls, far away from home but feels so close. this empty heart of mine will fall inside. and bring me back to life</segment3>
		<segment4>you can hold, you can mend. you can heal, you can break. I hold cause something etched this way</segment4>
		<segment5>father, healer deliver me from broken love. stay hear, closer let me hear your voice of love. savior, redeemer bring me to this place of peace. Jesus, garden my broken heart is so in need    </segment5>
