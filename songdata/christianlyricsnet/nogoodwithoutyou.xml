		<segment1>Talkin' all night while the radio. Playing songs we love, we're dancing slow. It's good to be with you. Then two years later you were running late. But I knew you were worth the wait. So I held out to see you. And day turned to night, I was still alright. 'cause I knew you'd be calling. And days turned to weeks, love was springin' leaks. Like rain it was falling. Chorus: 'Cause baby, it's no, no, no good without you. Everything's wrong since you've gone away. I tried to follow my dreams, but they're all about you. So where can I go, when honey I know. It's no good without you. I said hey, hey, hey, baby. Saturday night I'm alone again, I'm losing my mind, Caving in 'cause baby I miss you. Every thought, everywhere I go, every song on the stereo, is reminding me of you. I played my guitar and was told to stop. 'cause your love is amazing, amazing, amazing. 'cause I got to move on 'cause your love is gone. (Chorus). Everything fades from you. All I see is you. I'm barely breathing, always day dreaming. All I see is you. What I need is you. (Chorus)    </segment1>
