		<segment1>tears run down my face just like the last. no different from yesterday. sick from the mirror. do these prayers feel sincere. the dirt never washes clear. you were good, so good. i grew to love your lies. until i put you in the past. love was lust until he revealed. the man behund the mask. will the scars go away. in this world i have no place. forgive me Jesus this time i cry. i rip my heart outto give to you. alone it never did me any good. hold me close, wash my mind. destroy the me that lives inside    </segment1>
