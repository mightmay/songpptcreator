		<segment1>Isn't it easier if you want it like that. To run away baby, never come back. Than to sit around and cry</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, honestly!. If you try to find a problem here. You probably will. It's okay to cry and it's right to try. Just don't let it bring on a standstill. 'Cause these things all take time</segment2>

		<segment10>Oh, honestly!    </segment10>
