		<segment1>I feel like. I would like. To be somewhere else doing something that matters. And I'll admit here. While I sit here. My mind wastes away and my doubts start to gather. What's the purpose. It feels worthless. So unwanted like I've lost all my value. I can't find it. Not in the least bit. And I'm just scared, so scared that I'll fail you</segment1>
		<segment2>And sometimes I think that I'm not any good at all. And sometimes I wonder why, why I'm even here at all. But then you assure me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm a little more than useless. And when I think that I can't do this. You promise me that I'll get through this. And do something right. Do something right for once</segment3>
		<segment4>So I say if I can't. Do something significant. I'll opt to leave most opportunities wasted. And nothing trivial. That life could give me will. Measure up to what might have replaced it. Too late look. My date book. Is packed full of days that were empty and now gone. And I bet. That regret. Will prove to get me to improve in the long run</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm a little more than useless. And when I think that I can't do this. You promise me that I'll get through this. And do something right. Do something right for once. I'm a little more than useless. And I never knew I knew this. Was gonna be the day. Gonna be the day. That I would do something right. Do something right for once</segment5>
		<segment6>I noticed. I know this. Week is a symbol of how I use my time. Resent it. I spent it. Convincing myself the world's doing just fine. Without me. Doing anything of any consequence. Without me. Showing any sign of ever making sense. Of my time. It's my life. And my right. To use it like I should. Like he would. For the good. Of everything that I would ever know    </segment6>
