		<segment1>There is an endless song. Echoes in my soul. I hear the music ring. And though storms may come. I am holding on. To the rock I cling</segment1>
		<segment2>How can I keep from singing Your praise?. How can I ever say enough?. How amazing is Your love?. How can I keep from shouting Your name?. I know I am loved by the King. And it makes my heart want to sing</segment2>
		<segment3>I will lift my eyes. In the darkest night. For I know my Savior lives. And I will walk with You. Knowing You see me through. And sing the songs You give</segment3>
		<segment4>How can I keep from singing Your praise?. How can I ever say enough?. How amazing is Your love?. How can I keep from shouting Your name?. I know I am loved by the King. And it makes my heart want to sing</segment4>
		<segment5>I can sing in the troubled times. Sing when I win. I can sing when I lose my step. And I fall down again</segment5>
		<segment6>I can sing 'cause You pick me up. Sing 'cause You're there. I can sing 'cause You hear me, Lord. When I call to You in prayer</segment6>
		<segment7>I can sing with my last breath. Sing for I know. That I'll sing with the angels. And the saints around the throne</segment7>
		<segment8>How can I keep from singing Your praise?. How can I ever say enough?. How amazing is Your love?. How can I keep from shouting Your name?. I know I am loved by the King. And it makes my heart. I am loved by the King. And it makes my heart. I am loved by the King. And it makes my heart want to sing. I can sing    </segment8>
