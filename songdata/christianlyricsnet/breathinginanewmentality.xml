		<segment1>I'm the desperate. And your the savior</segment1>
		<segment2>There's been something else. Talkin' in my ear. Someone save me. When I speak. It begins to decay. I'm not about to bury myself. Oh God, my hands are shaking again. Calm down</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I can't feel the floor. And my vision takes it's toll on me</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, God it's racing through my veins. I'm afraid there must be some kinda mistake. Oh, I'm in over my head again. Reach in and grab a hold of me. I'm so scared that I've started to slip. They say that I'll never change. I'll prove 'em wrong</segment4>
		<segment5>It's over(2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>I hear the calling but it's passing through. Clean me up, show me how to live</segment6>
		<segment7>Tear me down. Let me start again</segment7>
		<segment8>.     </segment8>
