		<segment1>We're gonna break these walls down. Come on, baby. Let's bring them down. To the ground. Let's gewt outta this place. We've been so long. We're getting outta here. Let's bring them down. No more fear. No more holding back. Let's be stronger. Than we've been in the past. We're gonna break. These walls down. Come on, baby. Let's bring them down. We're tired, Tired of being held back. Captive by these walls and fear to tear them down. We're tired, tired of being helpless. We're so weak, but as one we'll tear them down. Tired of being put down. You put it down. Breakin' free. Breakin' free. I'm so sick and tired. Tired of being held back. You hold it back. Breakin' free. Breakin' fre. We're tired, tired of being held back. Captive by these walls and fear to tear them down. We're tired, tired of being afraid. It will be hard. But we will keep trying till they fall. We're tired, tired of being helpless. We're so weak but as one we'll tear them down. We're gonna break these walls. We won't wait any more. Never been so strong before. We're gonna break these walls. We won't wait any more. Never been so strong before. We are stronger. Today is the day. Beating harder. Today is the day. Breaking free </segment1>
