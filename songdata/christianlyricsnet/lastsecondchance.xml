		<segment1>She is not afraid, of setting suns. The light will start to fade, but never love. She's holding to the One, who lives to rescue. When all my hope is gone, what will I cling to? </segment1>
		<segment2>Come on and get up. Show me what you're made of. When push comes to shove. Come on and get up. Here comes another round. It's all come down. To your last second chance </segment2>
		<segment3>I've been here before, lonely and cold. Dark without a break, how could she have known. That He was the One, who came to rescue?. Now my hope is gone, can I find more in You? </segment3>
		<segment4>Your last second chance. You're last.     </segment4>
