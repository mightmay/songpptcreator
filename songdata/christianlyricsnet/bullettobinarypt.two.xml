let us die, let us die!. in dying we reply. and lower our baskets down. into the open bed. of the fruit truck passing by. and we can smile at each other again. me and my cantelope friend. cast our cares at the couple of pears. put a blueberry garland on an apple bed. the apple threw our half baked fears. like a wooden shoe in the windmill gear. the turning stopped and we clearly saw. the flaws in that which finds the flaw. the strawberry said to the tangerine. &quot;my face is red but our hats are green&quot;. be it orchard or a curling vine. the son of yours is the Son that's my. God.... ...</segment1>
		<segment2>lettuce grows, lettuce grows. in neatly sectioned beds and rows. but one day asked the gardener. to be moved to where the eggplant goes. &quot;reason being, i must confess. i adore her shining purple dress&quot;. as the eggplant listened in. she wasn't offended but she wasn't impressed. the potato called from underground. &quot;you've got it all turned upside down!. does the rain that sent each spring anew. to fall on her not fall on you?. you project on her your inward scene. she's a blank external movie screen. but the One who looks out from your eyes. looks through hers and looks through mine</segment2>
		<segment3>we all well know. we're gonna reap what we sow. we all well know. we're all gonna reap what we sow. so may we old fashionably suggest. the unmarried not undress. we well know. we're gonna reap what we sow. we all well know. we're gonna reap what we so. we all well know. what kind of crops are gonna grow. from each time you disrespect your parents. you better hope we don't hear it. we who know. you're gonna reap what you sow. we all well know. we're gonna reap what we sow. but grace, we all know. can take the place of all we owe. so why not, let's forgive everyone everywhere everything. all the time everyone everywhere everything</segment3>
