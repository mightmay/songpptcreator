		<segment1>The name of Jesus is a refuge. A shelter from the storm, a help to those who call. The name of Jesus is a fortress. A saving place to run, a hope unshakeable</segment1>
		<segment2>When we fall You are the Savior, when we call You are the answer. There is power in Your name, there is power in Your name</segment2>
		<segment3>In the name of Jesus. There is life and healing. Chains are broken in Your name. Every knee will bow down and our heats will cry out. Songs of freedom in Your name, oh, in Your name</segment3>
		<segment4>Bring salvation, bring Your Kingdom. Let all that You have made bring glory to Your name. When we fall you are the Savior, when we call You are the answer. There is power in Your name, there is power in Your name    </segment4>
