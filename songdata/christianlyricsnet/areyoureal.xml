		<segment1>Yeah uh uh. So much stress keeps running through my mind now. Fell into a mess that I that wish that I could climb out. I guess I hide it so nobodyll find out, The way everyone thinks that everything is fine now.</segment1>
		<segment2>At home things are messed up with mom and dad, And at school all my friends stab me in the back. No one is real anymore; I hate the way they act. Theres so many things that I wish I had.</segment2>
		<segment3>So God if your there do u understand?. Dont you care about anything thats happenin?. Its not fair to put me through all this junk again. You see that Im scared, so help me if you can.</segment3>
		<segment4>So please speak loud and clear cause Im listenin'. I need to know that youre real cause Im strugglin'. You need to show that your here cause Im stumblin'. Show me that you care this is why Im saying this</segment4>
		<segment5>Are you real?. I want to know (I want to know). Are you real?. Then let it go (you got to let it go)</segment5>
		<segment6>Are you real?. I want to know (I want to know). Are you real?. Then let it show (you got to let it show)</segment6>
		<segment7>It was right then, when everything began to change. I started looking at these things in a different way. I saw life through Gods eyes and it wasnt the same, And it was right at the time I called on your name.</segment7>
		<segment8>Then I saw all these lies that was thrown away. I recognized that I need you and on that day, I cried out and seek you, that was when you came. Now that I see you, Ive been through a major change.</segment8>
		<segment9>And I believe that youre real cause its so plain. I finally feel I can make it through anything. It dont matter what they speak or if they hate. They cant keep me down no more cause I seen your face.</segment9>
		<segment10>And for now on never will I be the same. Cause Im staying strong and I wont bend this way. Now that I know that youre real, its gonna be ok. Yeah, youre speaking in my ear and this is what you say</segment10>
		<segment11>Are you real?. I want to know (I want to know). Are you real?. Then let it go (you got to let it go)</segment11>
		<segment12>Are you real?. I want to know (I want to know). Are you real?. Then let it show (you got to let it show)</segment12>
		<segment13>See theres a war thats going on outside, And you can try to ignore and just run and hide. But everyday more and more people die. See the battles for souls, we're on the front lines</segment13>
		<segment14>So many souls, just too scared to fight. Theyre too worried about what people thinking of their life. How can you fight if you dont lay down your pride?. And how will anyone see if you wont shine your light?</segment14>
		<segment15>So many of your friends walking around blind. You got the source that can open up their eyes. Its yalls choice what you do with your lives, But Im gonna go to war cause I made up my mind.</segment15>
		<segment16>Jesus gave us life when he went and died. So the least that I could do is give him all of mine. So how many of yall are ready to fight by my side?. Cause this is what hes saying right now here tonight. Come on!</segment16>
		<segment17>Are you real?. I want to know (I want to know). Are you real?. Then let it go (you got to let it go)</segment17>
		<segment18>Are you real?. I want to know (I want to know). Are you real?. Then let it show (you got to let it show)    </segment18>
