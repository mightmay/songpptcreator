		<segment1>Every time I turn my back I get the feeling that. I'm 'bout to take a shot to the skully with a bat. I'm out of control, need you to fill my soul up. And could you shed a little light on the skeletons holed up. My past is taking me to task. And I can't guarantee how much longer I'll last. Without You I'm a hopeless wreck. So I cry out Your name as I drop to the deck </segment1>
		<segment2>Don't get me started, don't even get me started. Don't get me started, don't even get me started </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm Yours. Take me as I am. I'm Yours. So take this space between us and fill it up again. I'm Yours. Take me as I am. I'm Yours. So take this space between us and fill it up again </segment3>
		<segment4>Simple minded little punk. Thought I was the junk. Nobody ever told me that my doo-doo stunk. What was I out of my mind. Or was I just trippin' on an ego. But You filled up the space and You never let me go. Bullseye to the center of my soul. One shot but it rocked like a fatal blow. This love was Your gun, mercy Your shells. Now I'm a dead man walkin' down a skinny trail </segment4>
		<segment5>I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops. Give it all I got. Shout it from the rooftops. So you can take your best shot. I'm gonna shout it from the rooftops. Give it all I got. Shout it from the rooftops. Like it or not </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm a dead man walkin'. I'm a dead man walkin' down the boulevard.     </segment6>
