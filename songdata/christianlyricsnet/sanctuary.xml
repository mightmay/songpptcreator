		<segment1>Listen to all the people cheer. with empty tears in their eyes. a nation cries. for the sake of themselves. Opportunism deals with pain</segment1>
		<segment2>yet we still try to change our wicked ways. that we just can't seem to break. it's all on me. nothing to offer from here.</segment2>
		<segment3>and I never thought I'd see the day arrive, heroes who revise, won't be recognized. this world was given one last chance, to make this right in time.</segment3>
		<segment4>the next time that we fall, into ourselves. we should be sure that we won't deviate. Self sufficiency: the solution to sanctuary.</segment4>
		<segment5>and I never thought I'd see the day arrive, heroes who revise, won't be recognized. this world was given one last chance, to make this right in time.</segment5>
		<segment6>Structure, this is my own dysfunction. Are you listening?</segment6>
		<segment7>Now that you know, you can't deny, Because the truth is I never thought I'd see the day arrive, heroes who revise, won't be recognized. this world was given one last chance, to make this right in time.     </segment7>
