		<segment1>They say we cant make it through. Too young; dont know what to do. This life is much too hard for you and me. They say were living in our dreams. Black, white, and nothing in between. This world is never as it seems to be. But they dont want this. And they dont feel this. But this was never theirs at all! </segment1>
		<segment2>So here I stand. Im ready for anything. Just a man, but Im giving everything. Were here only for a second. And then were gone when we least expect it. So do more than survive. Lets live like were alive! </segment2>
		<segment3>They say, Stay inside the lines weve drawn. And you will be just fine. Dont take chances with your life. Cmon. But they dont want this. And they dont feel this. But this was never theirs at all! </segment3>
		<segment4>This world, weve gotta let it go. This life is out of our control.     </segment4>
