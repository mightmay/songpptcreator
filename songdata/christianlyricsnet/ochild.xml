		<segment1>I want to come closer, but you are so distant. Lately your thoughts are so far. I want to show you all that youre missing. And Ill meet you right where you are. </segment1>
		<segment2>Oh Love, Ive always known you. And, Oh Love, youve always been mine. Oh Love, Im only asking you for your life</segment2>
		<segment3>Say that you need me, I know what youre feeling. You cannot do this alone. I gave you my Word, and I gave you my life. So that youll never be on your own</segment3>
		<segment4>Youre waiting for this life to be what you want. (Is this what you wanted?). Youre waiting for this life to be what you need. (Is this what you needed?). Youre waiting for this life </segment4>
