	<english>
		<segment1>Sleep soundly in silence knowing that we will never return. To what we once were. What was now is a distant memory. We took to heart everything that you said</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. This is the sound that drives you to deny. These are the words that remind you were alive. This is the voice that haunts you in your sleep. Outdated. Forgotten. We're Yesterday's obsolete</segment2>
		<segment3>Sleep softly knowing that we are through. The spotlight has turned it's favor from us. And now it's upon you. And now I agree: We're better off dead</segment3>
		<segment4>[Second Chorus]. This is the sound that drives you to deny. These are the words that remind you were alive. This is the voice that haunts you in your sleep. Outdated. Forgotten. We're Yesterday's obsolete. Yesterday's model and oh so expendable. Is it comforting to know we're so temporary?</segment4>
		<segment5>You were so right to write me off</segment5>
		<segment6>[Outro]. When you're just a memory. I'll be there to remind you of what you said. As ash to ash. So you will return.. &quot;You once made such noise, but now so obsolete.&quot;    </segment6>
