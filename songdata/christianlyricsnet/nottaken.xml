		<segment1>Enter on the narrow path. That this world has covered with obstruction. For the path is wide and the road well worn. Leading on towards destruction. </segment1>
		<segment2>No strength to turn and fight. Or even the will to commit. The lane is now open wide. And many enter it. </segment2>
		<segment3>The gate is small, the road is narrow. That will leave this world behind. A trail leading on to life. That only a few will find. </segment3>
		<segment4>No strength to turn and fight. Or even the will to commit. The lane is now open wide. And many enter it.     </segment4>
