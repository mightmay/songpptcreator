		<segment1>Wonderful, So Wonderful. Is your unfailing love. Your cross has spoken mercy over me. No eye has seen no ear has heard. No heart could fully know. How glorious, how beautiful you are</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Beautiful One I love. Beautiful One I adore. Beautiful One my soul must sing</segment2>
		<segment3>Powerful so powerful. Your glory fills the skies. Your mighty works displayed for all to see. The beauty of your majesty awakes my heart to see. How marvelous how wonderful you are</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>You opened my eyes to your wonders anew. You captured my heart with this love. Because nothing on earth is as beautiful as you. (repeat 1X)</segment5>
