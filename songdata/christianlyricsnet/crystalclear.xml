		<segment1>When I'm a sparrow in winter, you are a seed I find. When I'm a heart with a splinter, your blood keeps me alive. If I could call you a color, you'd be the deepest of blues. If I had my pleasure of anything, you'd be the one that I'd choose</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for you. Now that I can see the mystery's revealed. Now I'm coming clean. I can feel my fears released. Now it's crystal clear I'm falling for you</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm soft like clay. Your hands they mold. For you, I would run away. Just to hear you calling out my name</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: I'm broken and empty. Without you, I'm blinded. I need you, I need you near me, I need you near me</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Please catch me, I'm falling for you..    </segment7>
