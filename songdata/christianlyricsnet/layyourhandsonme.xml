		<segment1>Verse 1: I say my doctor. And he told me. There ain't no way around it. There ain't no magic pill. He said, &quot;I looked for years. And tried but I ain't never found it, No way to fix your ills.&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>So I've come before. The great physician. Where I know the medicine is. Strong and free. Only you an cure this. Crossed up condition, Yeah, you know the very thing I need. </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Lay your hands on me, I need that something. Lay your hands on me, I want your touch. Lay your hands on me, You've got the power. Lord, you know I've got the need. So lay your hands on me. </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: We try to hide it. The New York Times said. &quot;God is dead&quot;. They never say. You never left the tomb. </segment4>
		<segment5>But I can't deny it. When you came down. With your love instead. Can you dig the upper room. </segment5>
		<segment6>Nothing in the world can steal it. 'cause your power is real, I know. Now all I want to do is feel it, So from the top of my head. To the tips of my toes. </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus: </segment7>
		<segment8>I don't need no psychoanalyst to get to you. Lay your hands on me.    </segment8>
