		<segment1>Chorus: Oh no, I'm not the one you see. So don't you go confusing me. I've got a different mentality. I'm trying to be drama free. You stress me out and that's the truth. I don't want no substitute. For the peace of my mind that comes to me. Cause I'm living drama free</segment1>
		<segment2>Can you give me one bit of rest?. Gotta say you didn't pass the test. I thought about it but you ain't God's best. You're just not what I need. Tried to run a stupid game on me. I'm not blind I see quite clearly. Can't have you disrespecting me. So I'm gone just like the breeze</segment2>
		<segment3>Can you give me just one bit of space?. Girl I love you but you're driving me insane. Gossiping always into trouble and then. You want me to justify. Tired of hearing stories, he said, she said. Tired of hearing bout the crazy things you did. Would you listen to me just once or twice?. Make a difference in your life. But you don't now</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: I've made changes I know you see. No more old this is my new leaf. Leaving behind all that's stressing me. Needlessly, drama free</segment4>
		<segment5>(Oh oh oh) Can you hear me?. (Oh oh oh) Can you feel me?. It's not that I don't care about it. It's just that I've got to do without it. (One) My choice to just be done. (Two) Hope I made it clear to you. (Three) Something that works for me. (Four) Don't want the drama no more     </segment5>
