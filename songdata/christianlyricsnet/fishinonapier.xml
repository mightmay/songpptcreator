		<segment1>(Once upon a time, God so loved the world). Johnny used to work on the docks. Fishin's been his life since John was a pup. It's tough  to stop. He would work with Simon and James. Workin' for his dad  he made fish fillets. For lunch  mmm  for lunch. He says. We gotta hold on to what we're taught. Because we may be Christians doesn't mean we forgot. We got deep water and nets and rods. So now. We're fishin' for God. Oh the pathway's clear. Oh fishin' on a pier. Hey, my man, the lake is right here. Oh fishin' on a pier. Karl has got a six-string that rocks. Now Keith's on the bass. And the dude who plays the drums is tough. Mmm Fred's tough. Jesus gave us somethin to say. Cause Christ's in our lives now we're fishermen. Parody's our bait mmm some say. We gotta hold on to what we're taught. He called us as musicians and we're praisin' our God. We got deep water. And lots of rock and roll. We're fishin' for God. Oh the pathway's clear. Oh fishin' on a pier. They're my band, the lake is right here. Oh fishin' on a pier. Fishin' on a pier. We gotta hold on  steady your rod. We fish for the guys that are called out by God. Oh the pathway's clear. Oh fishin' on a pier. They're my band, the lake is right here. Oh fishin' on a pier</segment1>
