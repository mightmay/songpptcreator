		<segment1>The other day i passed the place,you always liked to go. And i picked up the phone because, i thought you wanna know. But i forgot you weren't there i miss you all these days, that I am reminded of your smile and the funny things you'd say. I see you most at Christmas, you were like, a little kid. You always loved a good surprise, and now i must admit, that i long more for heaven than ever did before. You give me one more reason and each day i want it more</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Knowing we can spend a life time reminiscing on the past, knowing i will see your face again where tender moments last. It makes me wanna go there. (knowing i wont be alone). Knowing you'll be there. Makes it easy to go home</segment2>
		<segment3>You left a group of fisherman. Somehow, you left me too. Though i have felt you many times, i know you saw me through. I always long to feel your arms and look into your eyes, and talk forever me and you somewhere in paradise. (back to chorus)    </segment3>
