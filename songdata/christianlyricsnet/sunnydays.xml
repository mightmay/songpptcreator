		<segment1>sunny days keepin' the clouds away. i think we're coming to a clearing and a brighter day. so far away and still i think they say. the wait will make the heart grow stronger. or fonder, i can't quite remember, anyway</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: so if you're waitin' for love. well, it's a promise i'll keep. if you don't mind believing that it changes everything. time will never matter</segment2>
		<segment3>uh, uh, uhhh</segment3>
		<segment4>winter, spring -- is what love can truly bring. ice turns to water; water flows to everything. you can lose your mind. maybe then your heart, you'll find. i hope you won't give up what's movin' you inside -- no</segment4>
		<segment5>[CHORUS]</segment5>
		<segment6>(time will never matter)</segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS]</segment7>
		<segment8>(time will never matter)</segment8>
		<segment9>if the car won't start when you turn the key. when the music comes on, all your cold, cold heart can do. is skip a beat</segment9>
		<segment10>it's a promise i'll keep when you're waitin' for love. if you don't mind believing that it changes everything. time will never matter (time will never matter)</segment10>
		<segment11>[CHORUS]</segment11>
		<segment12>(time will never matter). no, time will never matter. (time will never matter). no, time will never matter. no, oo, oo    </segment12>
