		<segment1>This cloud that floats above me is getting old. Its been years and years and years of cold hard rain. But only few have ever really seen my pain. I can never see the sun shine. Unless its glowing off small kids with their big dads. Oh thats something that Ive never really had. How I wonder if I did. Would I be glad. Rain down your hammers and anvils. Lets build something great for the world to see. I hit the floor. Hurt more than I ever expected. Thought I was only supposed to get what I deserve. Did anyone see that fracture in my nerve. Oh. Its hope that has embraced me. And my God who wont forsake me. Sweet Jesus youre amazing. You save me every single time I fall down. Rain down your hammers and anvils. Lets build something great for the world to see. Rain down your hammers and anvils. Lets build something great for the world to see. Its simple things I keep forgetting. A loud voice to know the cloud above my head is soon to pass. This joy is not impossible. So forget all the improbable. Rain down your hammers and anvils. Rain down your love. Rain down your hammers and anvils. Lets build something great for the world to see    </segment1>
