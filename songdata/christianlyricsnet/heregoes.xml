		<segment1>Never got anywhere. By running away. Never learned anything. Without anything. Without a mistake</segment1>
		<segment2>Never loved anyone. By playing it safe. It's a long way, but. I'm right here now, so</segment2>

		<segment10>Here goes nothing. Here goes everything. Gotta reach for something. Or you'll fall for anything</segment10>
		<segment11>Here goes nothing. Here goes everything. Gotta reach for something. Or you'll fall for anything</segment11>
		<segment12>Take a breath, take a step. What comes next. God only knows. But here goes. And God only knows. But here goes    </segment12>
