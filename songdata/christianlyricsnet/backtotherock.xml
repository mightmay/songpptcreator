		<segment2>Back to the Rock that is higher than I. Take me to the well that will never run dry. Take me, take me, Lord. To the Rock that is higher than I </segment2>
		<segment3>There was a man who built his house upon the sinking sand. When the wind and rain came, it washed it all away. There was another man who learned to watch and pray. And he built his house upon a rock of Jesus and it still stands today </segment3>
		<segment4>Take me to the Rock. To the Rock of my salvation. Take me to the Rock. To the well for every nation. Take me to the Rock </segment4>
		<segment5>Everyone who hears the voice of Jesus and obeys. Is like the man who built his house upon the rock that stands. It was the Son of Man who gave us this command. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, your mind, your strength    </segment5>
