		<segment1>There's a time to live and a time to die. There's a time to laugh and a time to cry. There's a time for war and a time for peace. There's a hand to hold in the worst defeat, in the worst defeat</segment1>
		<segment2>He is with you when your faith is dead. And you can't even get out of bed. And your husband doesn't kiss you anymore. He is with you when your baby's gone. And your house is still and your hearts are stone. Crying God what'd you do that for. He is with you</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a time for yes and a time for no. There's a time to be angry and a time to let it go. There's a time to run and a time to face it. There is love to see you through all of this, through all of this</segment3>
		<segment4>He is with you in the conference room. When the world is coming down on you. And your wife and kids don't know you anymore. And He is with you in the ICU. When the doctors don't know what to do. And it scares you to the core. He is with you</segment4>
		<segment5>You may weep for a time. but joy will come in the morning, the morning light</segment5>
		<segment6>He is with you when your kids are grown. When there's too much space and you feel alone. And you're worried if you got it right or wrong. Yes, He is with you when you've given up. On ever finding your true love. Someone who feels like home. He is with you</segment6>
		<segment7>When nothing else is left. And you take your final breath. He is with you</segment7>
		<segment8>He is with you    </segment8>
