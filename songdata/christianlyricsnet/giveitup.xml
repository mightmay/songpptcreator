		<segment1>Listen to the radio late at night. Kind of makes me wonder. If everyone has the same urges to hear the old songs. We used to make fun of. Music ringing in my ears. Kind of help to ease my fears. How I wish I could make my worries disappear O, let it go. Write it off. Give it up to you I never really let it show. I always try to find a way to cover</segment1>
		<segment2>But deep inside I just come apart. When I think I have to face another. Little anxiety, or a bigger mystery. Why do all my doubts and worries keep haunting me. Sitting by the stereo. Turning every little question over. Hasnt gotten me anywhere. Never gets me any closer. Its a difficult thing to do. Leaving everything up to you. Must be the only way I can make it though.    </segment2>
