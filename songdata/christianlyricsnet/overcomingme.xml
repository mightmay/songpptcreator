		<segment1>Some say it's crazy. That you'd stay here by my side. I don't want to spend a day. Without you in my life. Maybe I'm a dreamer. And it seems that I'm lost within my mind. Searching for the moment dreams and destiny collide. I just need you to love me</segment1>
		<segment2>I can't stop you from overcoming me. It's brought me to my knees. I don't want you letting go of me. I'm standing in the pouring rain. I can't believe you'd do the same. I can't stop you from overcoming me</segment2>
		<segment3>I am not deserving. Of the way you see me in your eyes. You take me for who I am. I guess I wonder why. Maybe reassuring. Is all I can do in the meantime. And none of this can change the fact that lately. I've needed you around. I just need you to love me</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't stop you from overcoming me. It's brought me to my knees. I don't want you letting go of me. I'm standing in the pouring rain. I can't believe you'd do the same. I can't stop you from overcoming me</segment4>
		<segment5>I can't stop you from overcoming me. It's brought me to my knees. I don't want you letting go of me. I'm standing in the pouring rain. I can't believe you'd do the same. I can't stop you from overcoming me</segment5>
