		<segment1>It's like I've got nothing to do but think about you (all I can do, all I can do) </segment1>
		<segment2>everyday is a new day. and I don't have to pretend. all my friends think I'm crazy. but I don't want this to end </segment2>
		<segment3>when I have the chance I wanna say to u. wishing I could take back what I put u thru. I'll never do it again. we're like oil and water still we somehow mix. and what used to be broken is somehow fixed. it's hard to explain </segment3>
		<segment4>I know some people say. that opposites attract. if that's the truth then we. we will be together forever </segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus). it's like I got nothing to do but think about u. I've got all the time in the world. if you look in my heart. u'll know from the start. that's its all I can do. not to think about u </segment5>
		<segment6>I gave you good reason. to walk out that door. let me tell you I've learned a thing or two </segment6>
		<segment7>and I'm so amazed at the things u do. now dont let me go oh no </segment7>
		<segment8>I know some people say. that opposites attract. if that's the truth then we, we're meant to be together forever </segment8>
		<segment9>(chorus) </segment9>
		<segment10>I know some people say. that opposites attract. if that's the truth then we, we belong together forever </segment10>
		<segment11>(chorus).     </segment11>
