		<segment1>I wanna go home been gone so long. Remeber the way it was when Dad and Mom. Now it's gone but somethin gota keep the family strong. So we keep holdin to each other and our faith in God. Is what keeps us sane and carries us on. So kids from now on ya betta recognize. That there's no place like home. No place like home. Some sat that home is where the deart is. Not just your heart but your brothat and your sista. Your mother and your father that's where it's at. Fell in love said I do I you than carried you. Into the world that you once knew. Now it broke in two and ya don't know what to do. Brought tears to your eyes that made you realize. That there's no place like home. No place like home. take take take take me home. Yeah I grew up in a Christian house. Listenin to Psalty and Charity Church Mouse. Never did I know and never did I guess. That 18 years later our home would be a mess. Don't get all the treason don't know all the reasons. Why life takes turns good and bad searson. Something's gotta mend these ripped up hearts. Whatever happened to death do us part. Mom n dad come back around. Breakin' me the family tree gettin shut down. No place like home. Take take take take me home    </segment1>
