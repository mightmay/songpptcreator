		<segment1>the cross before me the world behind. no turning back. raise the banner high. it's not for me. it's all for YOU</segment1>
		<segment2>let the heavens shake and split the sky. let the people clap their hands and cry. it's not for us. it's all for YOU</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: not to us. but to YOUR name be the glory. not to us. but to YOUR name be the glory</segment3>
		<segment4>our hearts unfold before YOUR throne. the only place for those who know. it's not for us. it's all for YOU</segment4>
		<segment5>send YOUR holy fire on this offering. let our worship burn for the world to see. it's not for us. it's all for YOU. for YOU</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>the earth is shaking. the mountains shouting. it's all for YOU. the waves are crashing. the sun is raging. it's all for YOU</segment7>
		<segment8>the universe is spinning and singing. it's all for YOU. YOUR children dancing. dancing. dancing. it's all for YOU. it's all for YOU. my all for YOU. my all for YOU</segment8>
