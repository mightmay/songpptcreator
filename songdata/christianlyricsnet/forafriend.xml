		<segment1>Gone and disappearing on this cold night. I never thought it'd be that way. Your crying eyes they form the questions. Formed by the words that we have shared</segment1>
		<segment2>Uncovered signs now change the times. Perplexing incongruent lines. Unparalleled, impossible, complacent amiable souls</segment2>
		<segment3>God, I wanna see you on the inside. But it's not feeling like that way. I wanna see you on the inside. But it's not feeling like that way</segment3>
		<segment4>Confusion bleeds to vulture stares. Conviction bleeds the silence here. She suffocates and I regret. Waifer thin and falling from interest</segment4>
		<segment5>Goodbye my friend. And disappearing on this cold night. I never thought it'd be that way. Your crying eyes they form the questions. Formed by the words that we have shared</segment5>
		<segment6>I am sorry but this is the way it has to be right now. (The way it has to be). I am sorry but this is the way it has to be right now. (I don't wanna see you cry). I am sorry but this is the way it has to be right now. (The way it has to be). I am sorry but this is the way it has to be right now. (The way it has to be).     </segment6>
