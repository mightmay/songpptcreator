		<segment1>Do you feel the tensions rise. Do you know why we always fight. To be better, better than you. And you better than me</segment1>
		<segment2>I am not what you see, oh no. Not much more than a slave I wish to be. I am not what you see. Not much more a slave I should be. Nothing more, a slave I will be</segment2>
		<segment3>How could I ever think to be more. than the one who created me. I watched him do all that he said, his words were. &quot;Be a servant to all&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>I am not what you see, oh no. Not much more than a slave I wish to be. I am not what you see. Not much more a slave I should be. Nothing more, a slave I will be</segment4>
		<segment5>Only one deserves this exaltation. Only one deserves this elevation. But even He, He laid it down to serve on bended knee</segment5>
		<segment6>I am not what you see, oh no. Not much more than a slave I wish to be. I am not what you see. Not much more a slave I should be. Nothing more, a slave I will be    </segment6>
