		<segment1>Verse 1:Only You can take my fear, and turn it into strengthOnly You can take my shame and turn it back to innocentI thought I found out who I was, Until I lost myself inside of youAnd now I have finally found my worth inside of  youChorus:Its all I have, Its all I wantIts all I have, Its all I know to be realVerse 2:Knowing where I've come, brings me to my kneesYou turned these ashes to gold that I have brought to youI am waiting here, I won't move from this placeWhen your shadow is where I want to find myselfChorus 2:Its all I see, Its all I feelIts all I have found, its inside of meIts every breath (Its all I have), its every dream (Its all I have)    This hope you gave (Its all I have), can't be taken from me (Its all I have)Bridge:Can't be taken from me (Its all I have)Can't be taken from me (Its all I have)Can't be taken from me (Its all I have)Verse: 3Take me in, Don't let me go, I am hanging onto youI will follow you, your voice is all I haveI can't do this without youChorus: 3Its all I have, Its all I wantIts all I have, Its all I know to be real (x2)    </segment1>
