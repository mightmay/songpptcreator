		<segment1>i guess i never thought about how i would feel when i grew up. i guess i always tried to doubt it. it never seemed to make much sense. i try not to dwell upon it. but i guess my time is spent. i try not to dwell upon it or how much it meant. like rain that falls from the sky. time seems to flood my life. like rain that falls from the sky. time seems to flood my eyes. i'll try and grab it and wrestle it to the ground. it's always out of reach. it's always lost and never found. i'veo nly got one chance. will i ever have a second chance?. there goes today. what about tommorrow?. conformity, i'll never swallow. the world today full of pain and sorrow. apathy, i'll never follow. can we return to the golden age?. to the goals we set and the promises we made?. do you recall when we were friends?. just you and me to the very end. can we return to the golden age?. to the goals we set and the promises made. second chances!    </segment1>
