		<segment1>It's not a mysterious wind, And it's not the thunder rollin' in;. It's a spirit that I feel within that's callin'. I understand but I can't explain. Now I see love in a different way. And with a single leap of faith, I'm fallin'. Into your loving arms. Showing no resistance, There's a peace that flows over me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Sweet surrender, love me tender. You have captured my desiring heart completely. Sweet surrender, yours forever. I will gladly give my all to you. Receive me. oh lord, I am ever yours.</segment2>
		<segment3>Your love offers no escape, But I don't feel the need to run away. My heart has found a place to stay here with you. Nothing else could satisfy. The deep void that I had inside. From all the worldly battles I had lived through, Now here in your loving arms, I have gone the distance. I will rest my soul in your embrace.</segment3>
		<segment4>Sweet surrender, (surrender) love me tender. (tender). You have captured my desiring heart completely. Sweet surrender, (surrender) yours forever. (forever). I will gladly give my all to you. Receive me. oh</segment4>
		<segment5>Yes, I have gone the distance. I will rest my soul in your embrace.</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, oh, sweet surrender, (surrender) love me tender. (tender). You have captured my desiring heart completely. Oh lord, I am ever yours. Oh lord, I am ever yours.    </segment6>
