		<segment1>Why do our failures seem to have a voice. They say we're lost and we don't have a choice. Theyre telling us that we're not capable. They say our prison's inescapable</segment1>
		<segment2>Stand up now. They can't hold us down. Stand up now. Get up off the ground</segment2>
		<segment3>Why does our brokenness keep whispering. Its telling us that we're not anything. I say no fall is going to keep us out. This fear is something we'll forget about</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>bridge: Were fallen  it can't hold us down. These failures  they hold us down. Were broken  they can't hold us down. Were fallen  get up off the ground.     </segment5>
