		<segment1>Not yet a woman and certainly not a child. But I was caught somewhere in the middle. On that one Friday afternoon. And I, I remember mama saying, &quot;It's time for you to go. Go out on and change the world and become. All that you have dreamed of&quot;. And as the tears that she was crying. Fell from her face and shoulders she said. &quot;Don't forget who you are child, where you. Come from, where you're goin'. 'Cause I'm always gonna be here for you. Fighting in your corner. So with every bow you take. Take one for those that came before you&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Fly, Fly Butterfly Fly. Stand upon these two shoulders of mine. Spread those wings of yours and fly</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I'm a woman and I've got a child. And I can't believe the day's gonna come. When she tells me that it's time to soar. And I don't know what I'm gonna do. Not sure what I'm gonna tell her. Maybe don't forget who you are child. Where you come from, where you're going. 'Cause I'm always gonna be here for you. Fighting in your corner. So with every bow you take. Take one for those that came before ya</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>There is something sacred. About the letting go of those we want to hold. So tightly to, but somehow we know. They must move on. On for those who have a dream to make our future better. And on for those who will earn their wings. In spite of wind and weather. You tell 'em love is waiting there. Forever in their corner. So with every bow they take. They'll take one for those that came before them</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
