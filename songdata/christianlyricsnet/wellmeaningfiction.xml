		<segment1>Dull the edge so that it's softer. and it won't offend their ears. Water down to make it simple. you could sell it anywhere </segment1>
		<segment2>But now it seems you're disenchanted. and you're wanting more </segment2>
		<segment3>You're afraid to reason. Your love is saving no one. The market is open. If it's easy we will buy it all </segment3>
		<segment4>And I watched you let yourself out. like you had something to prove. but you're more than who you're sleeping with. and I know it bothers you </segment4>
		<segment5>And now it seems you're disenchanted. but you've got to save face </segment5>
		<segment6>Praising all your feelings they are only fiction. If you search for comfort you won't find it. In the end we don't get to answer to ourselves.     </segment6>
