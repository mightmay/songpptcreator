		<segment1>I don't even like the taste of blood. But it was all they had for sale today. And this is hunger that just won't go away. I was taught to drink my fill of you. You were taught to take take take from me</segment1>
		<segment2>The more I taste the more I need. The more it (You) makes me ill. The more I taste the more I need. Need my fill of you</segment2>
		<segment3>You are a sight for hungry eyes today. I am needing more of you inside of me. I am nothing more than what they've made of me. I was taught to drink my fill of you. You were taught to take take take from me</segment3>
		<segment4>And when my objects become used. I throw them all away. And when I need another fill. I'll turn to you again    </segment4>
