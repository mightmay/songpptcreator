		<segment1>Fight priest, Fight.Take pictures and make alright what you have lost, Give pride back to the ground. You got all you want, but all you have got is a wreck. Everyone in this whole wide world wake up and Panic. Fortune wears a red dress, but her bones smell of death. They all stare, but no one seeks. They all claim, but no one speaks. They all hear what they want. Panic preacher. Beware of these sheep in the costume of wolves, For lies, They come in pairs of two and we only die twice, But for such a very long time. Just because you kiss a lot, don't mean you're in love. Just because you have begun, don't mean you have won. I was a second son, not born but just once, and all my friends be gray. The fade out. They all close the door because no one speaks out loud. Take my heart, Prophet.     </segment1>
