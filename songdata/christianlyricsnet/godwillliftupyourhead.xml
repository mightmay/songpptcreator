		<segment1>Give to the wind your fear. Hope and be undismayed. God hears your sighs and counts your tears. God will lift up. God will lift up. Lift up your head</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). God will lift up your head. God will lift up your head. God will lift up your head. He will lift up, lift up your head</segment2>
		<segment3>Leave to His sovereign way. To choose and to command. Then shall we wandering on His way. Know how wise and how strong. How wise and how strong</segment3>
