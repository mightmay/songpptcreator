		<segment1>Chillin' at the lair. Snarf, me and the twins. My favorite feline is the one who wore cheetah skins. Fighting evil, we drink milk, and we purr a lot. Ask me to cross them, and I would say I'd rather not. Thundercats Ho!. I'm Lion-O!. Sword of Omens, come to me. Your eye opens so you can see. Fly from the sheath into my paw. I am the greatest Thundercat of them all.. I'm Lion-O!    </segment1>
