		<segment1>You wanna sound off but you can't find the words to. Nothin makes sense in the way that it used to. Can't find the plus in the positive thinking. The well's run dry and you're not done drinking</segment1>
		<segment2>Clouds start comin and the sky will fall. Clock stares back from the bedroom wall. Now youre breathin just to make it through the night</segment2>
		<segment3>All you need is a sunrise. Just a moment of dawn. If you're lost in the twilight. Close your eyes and move on. When you're tired in the waiting. Even though it's gonna take you. A little more time. Just a little more time the sun's gonna find you</segment3>
		<segment4>Holding your days like a stack of paper. Then you're chasing the wind as the pages scatter. You can save a few but you can't get em all back. So get out fast with your heart in tact</segment4>
		<segment5>Find yourself on the very edge. Lying awake in an empty bed. Now youre breathin just to make it thru the night</segment5>
