		<segment1>VERSE 1. All around the world. You hear now's the time. Break the chains and hold them high. Hold them high</segment1>
		<segment2>We were made for such a time as this. To make a difference. In the world we live. Now we live</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Who's dancing who's singing. Who's living a life worth living. We are we are we're shining. The light of salvation. Who's running who's loving. Who's breaking the doors wide open. We are we are we're shining. The light of salvation</segment3>
		<segment4>VERSE 2. Old has turned to something new and beautiful. Broken dreams are coming true. They're coming true</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS 2. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!. We're shining the light of salvation. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!. We're shining the light of salvation</segment5>
		<segment6>BRIDGE. We have made our choice we are. We are a generation with one voice to shout. Of Your salvation    </segment6>
