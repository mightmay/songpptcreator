		<segment1>Hostility- envy and rage. Negating life cancer spreading, eating away. Insanity- we are what we think. We sin against ourselves. The penalty we will reap. Isolation- building the wall. Insidious, emotional, and spiritual fall. Self Obsession- it really stinks. Smelling bad to everyone but the deceived. Separation, Alienation &quot;Healthy Specimen. Indignation, Deterioration &quot; Healthy Specimen. Isolation, Dark Depression- Healthy Specimen. Healthy Specimen! (4x)</segment1>
