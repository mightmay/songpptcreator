		<segment1>There's you and I in unity. It's time we take a stand so we can let the world see. God made different colors to make His people unique. Just because I'm different doesn't mean that I'm a freak. Or maybe I am a freak for the man Himself who died for me. We're daily on a mission from God in search of unity. it's time you open your eyes see the problem at hand. All you have to do is love and live and take your own stand</segment1>
		<segment2>And love each other like a brother. All you people love them like they were your sister or your mother. It's time we stoop the hate so we can't hurt one another. 'Cause that ain't it that ain't right. Congregate we got to fight. The end will come keep Him in sight. His people unify it's time we all fight</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>You and I in unity. That's what love should be. You and I in unity. It's time for the world to see</segment4>
		<segment5>Denomination it shouldn't stop a congregation. From being one with every tongue and every tribe and every nation. Tribulation the force that fought for people left behind. Revelation I got to let them know the missions mine. All those different places of different races and different faces. We come together as one achievable through graces. It's not about the fat pockets or scrilla. We got to stand up straight and be strong like a pillar</segment5>
		<segment6>We got to stand up and fight. You know the time is right. We got to keep the end in sight. So His people stand up and fight    </segment6>
