		<segment1>You were a song that I couldn't sing. you were a story I couldn't tell. I've only ever loved myself. But I've loved myself so well. And how defeated I return!. (you're nice and blue, you're nice and blue). I missed what I was supposed to learn. as all I learned about was missing you. </segment1>
		<segment2>A life left half ehind, though no longer. blind I can't yet see. I'm not the boy that. I once was, but I'm not the man I'll be. I've been waiting now, for six years on. (and have only just begun). For the day you'll hold her in your arms, oh risen Lord, my precious one. </segment2>
		<segment3>I was once the wine, and you the wineglass. I was once alive, when you held me. God became the glass, all things left were emptiness. Oh, my little girl, if you look out. andsee a trace of dark red that used. to be my face, in the clarity of his. grace: remember me.     </segment3>
