		<segment1>I don't know what to do, I dont know what to say. It hurts me to let go when she looks at me that way. </segment1>
		<segment2>Oh can she see, what she's doing to me? </segment2>
		<segment3>I thought that she was mine, I guess I was wrong. It seems she's changed her mind, looks like she's moved along </segment3>
		<segment4>Couldn't understand what she was trying to say, I finally figured out that I was in her way, now I'm okay. She wasn't too down with rock and roll scene, She wasn't too down with the pain that it brings, oh yeah. She sprouted wings and flew away    </segment4>
