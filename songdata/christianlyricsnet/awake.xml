		<segment1>Midnight, I've fallen fast asleep. Daylight, I can't remember anything. So many questions that get in the way. About this Place I keep sleeping awake</segment1>
		<segment2>So wake me and tell me what You see. And let me walk with You in the Streets. The Streets with no name, cause I feel far away. I always fail to remember</segment2>
		<segment3>Why do I feel like I'm slipping away?. Why do I feel so far away?. Wake me up inside my dreams just in time for me to believe</segment3>
		<segment4>Another morning chasing lies after another evening chasing skies. So make tonight my reality, so tomorrow, I remember everything</segment4>
		<segment5>Why do I feel like staying awake when I fall asleep?</segment5>
		<segment6>It's hard to believe these things that I can't see. So I need to wake up inside my dreams.     </segment6>
