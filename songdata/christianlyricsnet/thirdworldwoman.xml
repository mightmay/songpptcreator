		<segment1>What if I were that mother staring from my TV. What if that were my brown-eyed baby. Hungry as she could be. What if that were my family. What if that was my world. Waiting on water waiting on a vaccine. Waiting on someone to bring me a bag of beans. Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me</segment1>
		<segment2>What of I was that mother and I was waiting on me. The big success so well dressed on the other side of the sea. Living with my distractions. Lifes been good to me. Maybe shes praying. Praying for a miracle. Maybe the answer is me</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me</segment3>
		<segment4>I was born in Georgia where I could do as I pleased. And I can get my hands on just about anything I might need. Whos that third world woman. Maybe she could be. Could be mother, could be daughter. Could be sister to me</segment4>
		<segment5>Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me. Lord have mercy on me    </segment5>
