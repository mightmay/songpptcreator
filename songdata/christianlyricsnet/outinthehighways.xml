		<segment1>There's a chapel on wheels parked at a truck stop. Somewhere in the southern part of Florida tonight. Many are blown in by a strong wind. It's the wind of the Spirit. There's a preacher with his head bowed. There at the alter. Whispering a prayer as the people wander in. Sayin' it's You, Lord, that they're looking for. Whether they know it or not. And that's the reason I've got to go</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Our in the highways, out in the highways. Maybe this will be the day they come to meet You on their way. Out in the highways</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a church down on the corner with stained glass windows. But time has stained the windows till no light is shining through. Those on the outside pass right by. Lost on a dark endless highway. There's a banner on the church wall. They put up many years ago. Reminding them that Jesus said &quot;go into all the world&quot;. They need the Spirit wind to blow again. And fan the flame of concern. Take the truth that they've learned and go</segment3>
