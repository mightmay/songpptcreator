		<segment1>The devil is alive, cause I can feel him breathing. Over the horizon comes hell and my arms wide open. As I embrace the apocalypse. This is what you came to know as fear. Hes here This is The Great Fear!</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). I dont care who you are. You're afraid of death, you're terrified. By how the worlds going to end. So follow me as I take you to the one where life begins. Where life begins</segment2>
		<segment3>A flash, with black roses in our hands. We fall to the floor like ash. The hatred placed in humanity leads to the love of global destruction. And worship of senseless slaughter.</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>(Now put all this suffering and hatred together, this won't last forever). THIS WON'T LAST FOREVER!!!. (We are enslaved to a darkened world). I WILL NEVER FOLLOW!!!</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>(Everyone here will Die, but the great fear is being left behind.). Hell is coming but I embrace the one. who stands alone. HELL IS COMING!    </segment7>
