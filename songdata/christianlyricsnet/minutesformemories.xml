		<segment1>I'm trading my minutes for memories. To live and relive those moments. When loneliness was miles away. So sweet is the taste of communion </segment1>
		<segment2>You're dying to know me. </segment2>
		<segment3>What is this life without love?. Dying is living without you here. </segment3>
		<segment4>I let down my arms and open my eyes. The beauty from within and I am a vapor.     </segment4>
