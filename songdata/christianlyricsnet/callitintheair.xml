		<segment1>There are a lot of things you never say. I read between the lines. I admit at times I've been unclear. I'm coming clean. This time next year</segment1>
		<segment2>They say the more you love. The less you know. And there are places we should never go. And things I should not have to know about</segment2>
		<segment3>Call it in the air. Stop pretending like you care. Just take it all. Or leave it there. But just call it in the air</segment3>
		<segment4>We were stuck together. Like two kids caught in a fire. We were stubborn. Or too stupid. Or too scared. To get out. So what can I say?. What can I say?. I can't think of one good reason. To get up and walk away</segment4>
		<segment5>Call it in the air. Stop pretending like you care. Just take it all. Or leave it there. But just call it in the air</segment5>
		<segment6>You're so in love. But can't commit</segment6>
		<segment7>You're so in love. But can't commit</segment7>
		<segment8>Call it in the air. Stop pretending like you care. Just take it all. Or leave it there. But just call it in the air.     </segment8>
