		<segment1>Father, hear my prayer. I need the perfect words. Words that he will hear. And know they're straight from You. I don't know what to say. I only know it hurts. To see my only friend slowly fade away</segment1>
		<segment2>So maybe this time I'll speak the words of life. With Your fire in my eyes. But that old familiar fear is tearing at my words. What am I so afraid of?</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: 'Cause here I go again. Talkin 'bout the rain. And mulling over things that won't live past today. And as I dance around the truth. Time is not his friend. This might be my last chance to tell him. That You love Him. But here I go again, here I go again</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, You love him so, You gave Your only Son. If he will just believe; he will never die. But how then will he know what he has never heard. Lord he has never seen mirrored in my life</segment4>
		<segment5>This might be my last chance to tell him. That You love him. This might be my last chance to tell him. That You love him. You love him, You love him</segment5>
		<segment6>What Am I so afraid. What am I so afraid. What am I so afraid of?. How then will he know. What he has never heard    </segment6>
