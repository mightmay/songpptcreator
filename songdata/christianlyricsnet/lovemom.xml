		<segment1>did you ever stop to think about did you ever stop to think about did you ever stop to think about it the legacy you'll leave behind the one of pain desctructed and confined with lament you'll raise them how could you just walk away from bring destruction to innocence that looks to you their whole life depends on you and this is what you gave your e-ticket out the selfish act that sent you to the grave you didn't kill yourself the bullet missed your head it went straight to the heart of wide eye children you didn't kill yourself it went straight to their hearts signed love mom fall back on me fall back on me just stop and think about the pain you have caused you can't run away you can't run away from it.     </segment1>
