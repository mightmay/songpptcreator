		<segment1>Striving forward, not looking to the past. Sanctification to free me at last. On the rise, I feel the world all around me, But the lord has come to give new life to me.. Free me. Justification of my ways. I see the goal, but it seems so far away. God give me the strength to carry on. Until I've past and Your will has been done.. Father I'm on my knees. Lord Jesus, come and fill me. Without you, I am nothing. Oh Lord I am nothing. And I will serve until your coming.     </segment1>
