		<segment1>There was a time in your life. When you wanted the pain to leave. There were tears in your eyes. You were down on your knees. Asking forgiveness. Said you'd do anything. But, did ya mean it?. Chorus. And I know you know the difference. Between a promise and a lie. And I know you know the difference. Between what is wrong and right. I know you said you gave it all to Jesu Christ. You said that someday. Said you'd do anything. But, did ya mean it?. There was a time in your life. When you were so afraid. Nothing could go right. You got on your knees and prayed. You said that someday. You would do anything. But, did ya mean it?. Now the time has come to make yor promise true. But you sit around after all He's done for you. You need forgiveness, you don't do anything. You didn't mean it. (Chorus)    </segment1>
