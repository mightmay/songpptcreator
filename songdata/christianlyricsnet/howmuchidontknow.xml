		<segment1>I want to show you how much, I don't really know you too much. and I can't skip by this misfortunate perdicament. I can't get myself out of it, it's all too much. too late, yes guess that's so. guess I just wanted to know. but I can't think responsibility considering. it's all there is to being me. and I just thought you should know</segment1>
		<segment2>If you just keep opening doors. I promise that I'll keep testing the locks. [4 times]</segment2>
		<segment3>Hello, this is the end of the line. Oh yeah, I'm doing just fine. No I won't pretend that I am open eyed. unsuprised or anything but mystified, True and tried, I guess it takes this long to realize just how much I don't know.     </segment3>
