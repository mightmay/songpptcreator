		<segment1>One heart, one voice. Living out love in this world of noise. My dream and my joy. Giving you all I have made a choice. Desperately I'm waiting. To answer your calling</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. I will be a candle in the darkness. I will be the hand of heaven above. I will be a mirror that reflects your. Endless love. I will be the hope among the hopeless. Where there is conflict I will be peace. Only by the power of your spirit that's living in me. I will be</segment2>
		<segment3>Your heart, your plan. Give me your eyes help me understand. My feet, my hands. Holding out living hope to every man. Knowing what you've made me. With every single heartbeat</segment3>
		<segment4>[Repeat Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>Gracious, Gentle and Kind. Knowing that your love will shine. Through mine</segment5>
		<segment6>[Repeat Chorus]</segment6>
		<segment7>[Tag]. This little light of mine, I'm gonna. Let it shine. This little light of mine, yeah.     </segment7>
