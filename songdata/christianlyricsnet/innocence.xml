		<segment1>Something I'm not supposed to talk about. The way you violated me. Something that I could've lived without. The way you put your hands all over me. I wonder do you lie awake and think at night?. How you tore my innocence in two. I wonder do you cry yourself to sleep at night?. 'Cause I can tell you it's what you made me do. . (Chorus:). And I can't get back my innocence. I can't get back my innocence. how could you steal my innocence?. how could you steal my innocence?. . Sometimes I think about what I would do. If I ever saw your face again. So many untold stories only you can tell. Guess i'll just let God contend with you. . (Chorus:). And I can't get back my innocence. I can't get back my innocence. how could you steal my innocence?. How could you steal my innocence?. I can't get back my innocence. I can't get back my innocence. How could you steal my innocence?. How could you steal my innocence?. . God gave me back my innocence. God gave me back my innocence. God gave my life back to me. God gave me back my innocence    </segment1>
