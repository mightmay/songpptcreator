		<segment1>We got music to soothe your soul. We're gonna get down with a little bit of rock and roll. We got rhythm to move your feet. We're gonna make you get up off your seat. When I lift You up they come running. When I sing Your song the world's turning to You. Just the sound of Your name is a beautiful thing. I love You, I love You, I love You. Your name is, beautiful. It drips off my lips like drops of gold. It makes me want to dance. It's my fortune, my deliverance     </segment1>
