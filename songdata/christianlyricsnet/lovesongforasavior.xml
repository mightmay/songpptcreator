		<segment1>In open fields of wild flowers. She breathes the air flies away. She thanks her Jesus for the daisies and the roses. In no simple language. Someday she'll understand the meaning of it all </segment1>
		<segment2>He's more than the laughter. Or the stars in the heavens. As close as a heartbeat. Or a song on her lips. Someday she'll trust him. And learn how to see him. Someday he'll call her. And she will come running. Fall in his arms, the tears will fall down. And she'll pray </segment2>
		<segment3>I want to fall in love with you </segment3>
		<segment4>Sitting silent wearing sunday best. The sermon echoes through the walls. A great salvation through it. Goes to the people who stare into nowhere. Can't feel the chains on their souls </segment4>
		<segment5>He's more than the laughter. Or the stars in the heavens. As close as a heartbeat. Or a song on her lips. Someday we'll trust him. And learn how to see him. Someday he'll call us. And we will come running. Fall in his arms. The tears will fall down and we'll pray </segment5>
		<segment6>I want to fall in love with you </segment6>
		<segment7>Seems to easy to call you savior. Not close enough to call you a god. So as I sit and think of. Words I can mention to show my devotion </segment7>
		<segment8>I want to fall in love with you    </segment8>
