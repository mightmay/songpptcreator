		<segment1>I've had enough of living life for only me. And reaching just for the things that keep destroying me. So sick of envying the lives of so many I see. Somehow believing that they have what I need</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. My God's enough for me. This world has nothing I need. In this whole life I've seen. My God's enough, enough for me. I can't explain why I suffer though I live for You. Those who deny You they have it better than I do. Cover my eyes now so that my heart can finally see. That in the end only You mean anything</segment2>
		<segment3>Who have I in heaven but You. Nothing I desire but You. My heart may fail but not You. You are mine forever    </segment3>
