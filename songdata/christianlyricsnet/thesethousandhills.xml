		<segment1>These thousand hills roll ever on. In footprints of a Mighty God. They bring me to my knees in praise. Amazing love, amazing grace</segment1>
		<segment2>Was on a hill my Savior died. A broken heart, a bleeding side. Hill of the skull, Mount Calvary. The blood He shed, He shed for me</segment2>
		<segment3>When heaven's hills at last I roam. Forever settle in my home. I'll join the saints around Your throne. Your kingdom, Lord, rolls ever on</segment3>
		<segment4>These thousand hills roll ever on. Ripples of a coming storm. The morning star precedes the dawn. These thousand hills roll ever on    </segment4>
