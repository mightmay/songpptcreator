		<segment1>Searching high with a yellow soul. I dig for ashes in a sea of gold. Drifting low, my yellow soul. I'll live on air if the clouds will hold. Jesus riding on a white horse. Hero calling from the sky. Jesus riding on a white horse. with spare room for you and I to fly. Riding on a white horse high. wanna ride, wanna ride so high. On a white horse high. Sail high on the ocean sky. searching high with a yellow soul. There's no tomorrow in the days of old. I was falling low, my yellow soul. It's sad to burn, left in the cold    </segment1>
