		<segment1>Tell me the story about the Man. Who came down from the sky. Who healed the broken hearted with His hand. And dried the tear-dimmed eye. Oh, I would give anything. To see Him face to face and. Oh He gave us everything. To make the world a better place</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Oh, where does that kind of love come from. They say that it runs in His blood. Oh, where can I find that kind of love. They say it runs in His blood</segment2>
		<segment3>The way He died upon the cross. Was that the only way. To save the children who were lost. Will he back again some day. Oh I would give anything. To see Him face to face and. Oh, He gave us everything to make the world a better place</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, I want to find that kind of love. They say that it runs in His blood. Oh, where does that kind of love come from. They say that it runs in His blood. Oh, where can I find that kind of love. They say that it runs in His blood    </segment5>
