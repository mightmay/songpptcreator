		<segment1>Further instructions will come in a dream. Brain will revolt as the villagers scream. Leaders assemble and gamble for rank. All that was right is now wrong. This means everything to you. Nothing means everything to you. Tables of measure have overruled fate. You like to bargain to settle debate. We supply choices for few to resolve. A lesson to learn in us all. This means everything to you. Nothing means everything to you. Is it the wisest choice you made?. What a tragic game you played. It was your equivalent, to become someone you could not be. What were their last words. &quot;Its all downhill from here.&quot;. This one will be the last one you trust. This time, there no time. Is it the wisest choice you made?    </segment1>
