		<segment1>I can see your heart is yearning. Everything is so unclear. Is the answer ever coming. After all these years. Its not an easy feeling. Sometimes it seems unfair. But He knows just what Hes doing. With unanswered prayers. So hold on</segment1>
		<segment2>Its worth the wait. Just keep believing. God has perfect timing. Never early, never late. It takes a little patience. And it takes a lot of faith. But its worth the wait</segment2>
		<segment3>What if what youre desperate for. Isnt what you really need. What if there was something more. Than what you dreamed. We may not always see. We may not understand. But He knows just what Hes doing. Hes got a bigger plan. So hold on</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>In His time, youll be fine. All this waiting, now, is by design</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>In His time, youll be fine. All this waiting, now, is by design    </segment7>
