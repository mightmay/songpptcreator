		<segment1>(Verse 1). I sing my melody, my simple melody. Unto the one wise and true living God. I give my sacrifice because You paid the price. So that my life would have meaning and more. You gave me hope that endures, my fallen soul You secured. Please take my melody, my simple melody. Straight from my heart to Your soul. Straight from my heart to Your soul</segment1>
		<segment2>(Verse 2). I sing my song of praise, my simple song of praise. Unto the Lamb that was slain for my sin. I give my offering unto You, Lord and King. Its from victories Youve helped me to win. Its a melody filled with You praise, my voice unto You I raise. Please take my song of praise, my simple song of praise. Straight from my heart to Your soul. Straight from my heart to Your soul</segment2>
		<segment3>(Bridge). Here is my melody, my simple melody. Straight from my heart to Your soul. Here is my melody, my simple melody. Straight from my heart to Your soul</segment3>
		<segment4>(Channel). Its a melody filled with You praise, my voice unto You I raise. Here is my offering, please take my offering. Straight from my heart to Your soul. Straight from my heart to Your soul</segment4>
