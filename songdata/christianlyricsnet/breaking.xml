		<segment1>Do you memorize theatrical lines. that seem to lead them in. Play the role with the good girl heart. oh the tangled web within. Who was it that lead you on. that made you want to hurt me so. Who are you out to forget. who's forgot you long ago </segment1>
		<segment2>Do you still feel it. calling in the act tonight. do you still feel it. seems like you've done this before. You make breaking hearts look so easy. seem like you've done this before. You've got breaking hearts all but down. and you've done this, you've done this before. You make stealing hearts look so easy. Where is the girl I adore. You've got breaking up all but down. I can't love a thief anymore </segment2>
		<segment3>Do you collect the souls you've lost. in the top of your dresser drawer. count the number of tears displaced. on lonely bedroom floors. where the shape of your heart once was. slowly takes the place of you. will they hold the memories now. of the love I though I knew </segment3>
		<segment4>Do you still feel it. calling in the act tonight. Do you still feel it. Seems like you've done this before. You make breaking hearts look so easy. seems like you've done this before. You've got breaking up all but down. and you've done this, you've done this before. You make stealing hearts look so easy. Where is the girl I adore. You've got breaking up all but down. and I can't love a thief anymore </segment4>
		<segment5>You make breaking hearts look so easy. You've got breaking up all but down. You make breaking hearts look so easy. Seems like you've done this before. You've got breaking hearts all but down. You've done this, you've done this before </segment5>
		<segment6>The most you could hope to be. now just a bitter sweet memory.     </segment6>
