		<segment1>Why seek out the truth in a world of lies to unmask right in wrongs disguise;. to be sincere in the crowds that fall, and not to be satisfied with less than your all?.. all?</segment1>
		<segment2>Lifting of the weak starts inside. Your compromise, choose your side or stand aside.</segment2>
		<segment3>Your pride can be your best friend or your enemy. It can tear from side to side to mediocrity. Faith in what can be accomplished with your life . decide to choose a higher standard for your fight.. fight.</segment3>
		<segment4>Your life sets the stage, be strong in your beliefs, and lend a helping hand to lift the weak to stand. Lifting.. lifting.. lifting.. lifting up the weak.</segment4>
		<segment5>Lifting of the weak starts inside. Your.. your compromise, choose your side or stand aside.. aside.    </segment5>
