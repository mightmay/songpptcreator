		<segment1>Majesty of heaven. You're glory fills the skies. Light of the world. You are lord of all</segment1>
		<segment2>Humbled by your presence. Amazed by who you are. Nothing compares. You are lord of all</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. To you the nations bow down. To you a creation cries out. Majesty. All things you hold together. Your name will stand forever. Majesty. You are majesty</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2. Merciful and mighty. My heart is overwhelmed. You stand alone. You are lord of all</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Your name above all others. High and exalted. Your kingdom shall reign forever. High and exalted.     </segment5>
