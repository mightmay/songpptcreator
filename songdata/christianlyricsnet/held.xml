		<segment1>Two months is too little. They let him go. They had no sudden healing. To think that providence. Would take a child from his mother. While she prays, is appalling. Who told us we'd be rescued. What has changed and. Why should we be saved from nightmares. Were asking why this happens to us. Who have died to live, it's unfair. This is what it means to be held. How it feels, when the sacred is torn from your life. And you survive. This is what it is to be loved and to know. That the promise was that when everything fell. We'd be held. This hand is bitterness. We want to taste it and. Let the hatred numb our sorrows. The wise hand opens slowly. To lilies of the valley and tomorrow. This is what it means to be held. How it feels, when the sacred is torn from your life. And you survive. This is what it is to be loved and to know. That the promise was that when everything fell. We'd be held. If hope if born of suffering. If this is only the beginning. Can we not wait, for one hour. Watching for our savior. This is what it means to be held. How it feels, when the sacred is torn from your life. And you survive. This is what it is to be loved and to know. That the promise was that when everything fell. We'd be held. [Repeat Chorus].     </segment1>
