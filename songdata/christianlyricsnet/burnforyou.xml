		<segment1>Im a brand new man, Im a conscious man. Im a man whos burnin for you. The mistakes Ive made have been chased away to the bottom of the ocean blue. Im a brand new man in a foreign land, Im a man whos feelin that fire. And its all so clear when Im standing here at the peak of my desire</segment1>
		<segment2>So wont you move me like you used to. I want the world to know I burn for you</segment2>
		<segment3>I feel revived again, I am alive again. (Burnin for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up. I feel revived again, Im energized again. (Burnin for you) You got me lifted and lifted you lift me up</segment3>
		<segment4>Woke up in a sweat, those ghosts in my head. Had a grip, but I slipped on by. Its a whole new day as the darkness fades. And the suns climbing in the sky. I concede, my love, that I need your love. Im before you, a broken man. And its only you, no substitutes who can renew this soul again</segment4>
		<segment5>You got me higher than Kilimanjaro. Got me believin I can &quot;save the day. Im up and running like their aint no tomorrow. Id rather burn for you than fade away. Id rather burn for you than go my way</segment5>
		<segment6>Im a whole new guy with a whole new vibe. Changed inside  more flame in the fire. Cant stop, wont stop praying for desire. Like the bunny on the screen feel so energized. Old shell gone without a trace, new face. No more shortness of breath, new pace. Live life now without the taste of fear. TOBYMAC, Double Dutch now let the smoke clear    </segment6>
