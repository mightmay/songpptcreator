		<segment1>Carry me, Your love is wider than my need could ever be. Come to me, and I will walk along Your shore. Feel Your crashing waves sing in time with the music of my heart </segment1>
		<segment2>Pour out, come down on me. Pour out, come down on me </segment2>
		<segment3>River deep, could I know You as well as You know me. Constantine, will we travel faster, farther than these. Legs could ever trustworthy be </segment3>
		<segment4>Pour out, come down on me. Come down, pour out on me </segment4>
		<segment5>Come down, pour out on me. Come down, pour out on me     </segment5>
