		<segment1>I believe in treating women, like I want to be treated. When a woman's degraded, by the lustful eyes of men, I'm angry. It makes me sick, seeing women looked at as objects. I'm getting tired of the lack of decency, worn in public.</segment1>
		<segment2>I think there's more to it, then overlooking it all. Then pointing the finger and screaming. It's all the men's fault. It makes me sick, to see women looked at as objects. Are we expecting too much from guys, when girls wear too little?.     </segment2>
