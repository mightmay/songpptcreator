		<segment1>here i bring my stains and crown. gentle river wash me now. Your love is deeper than i know. Your waves higher than i can go. lead me in Your holiness. i will follow, i confess. glory is the song i sing. Your life is living me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: where would i be, without You, without You. where would i be without You</segment2>
		<segment3>i will bow before the cross. cherish my redeemer's cost. there is nothing i can do. than only stand amazed by You. immersing You with everyday. wrapped up in Your arms of grace. nothing more, You're all i need. Your life is living me</segment3>
		<segment4>[chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>bridge: like a waterfall, You fill my heart and overflow. like a candle flame, You light my way and lead me as i go [2x]</segment5>
		<segment6>*where would i be, without You, without You</segment6>
		<segment7>spirit over, let me overlow [4x]. let me overflow [4x]    </segment7>
