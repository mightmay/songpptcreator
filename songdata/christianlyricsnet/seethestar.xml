		<segment1>See the Star that's breaking through. To shine upon this head of mine and the people who. Are running for the goal ahead. And we won't stop 'til we reach the end</segment1>
		<segment2>This day it's time to fix our eyes. I'm living for the greatest prize</segment2>
		<segment3>So we run, never stop, keep my feet on the road. So we run, never stop, set my feet on the road</segment3>
		<segment4>We live the life and dream the dream. But what you gonna do when walls come down and fall on you. Pick up your head and feel the sun. Cos we won't stop 'til the race is won</segment4>
		<segment5>Today I'm walking in the light. We'll keep this flame that's burning bright</segment5>
		<segment6>So we run, never stop, keep my feet on the road. So we run, never stop, set my feet on the road. So we run, never stop, keep my feet on the road. So we run, never stop, I'm feeling sweet upon the rock    </segment6>
