		<segment1>I stand in awe. That You know my name. Just a glimpse of Your love for me. And now I am changed. Because You, showed me how. To walk a different way. I have peace like I've never known. I am living. You move me. Lord You move me. There's a fire burning in my soul. And it's flowing through me. Lord You move me. Lord You move me. Now I must tell the world what I know. You move me. For too many years. I have been color blind. Only saw in shades in grey. Stuck in black and white. By grace you opened my eyes. Now I see the light. And Your love has colored my world. And makes my soul cry. [Chorus]. Day after day I'm amazed. That You gave Your life for me. When I think of the price that you paid. How could I not say?. [Chorus]    </segment1>
