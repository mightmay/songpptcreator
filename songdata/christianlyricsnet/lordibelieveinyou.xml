		<segment1>Though I can't see Your holy face. And Your throne in heaven above. It seems so far away. Though I cant touch your nail scarred hands. I have a deep and unspeakable joy. That makes my faith to stand</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, I believe in You. I'll always believe in You. Though I cant see you with my eyes. Deep in my heart. Your presence I find. Lord, I believe in You. And I'll keep my trust in You. Let the whole world say what they may. No one can take this joy away. Lord, I believe</segment2>

		<segment4>Lord, I believe in You. I'll always believe in You. Though I cant see you with my eyes. Deep in my heart. Your presence I find. Lord, I believe in You. And I'll keep my trust in You. Let the whole world say what they may. No one can take this joy away. Lord, I believe    </segment4>
