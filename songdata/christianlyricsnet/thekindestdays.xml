		<segment1>You right in front of me. Now I can clearly see. All Your greatness. But it separates this. From what I ever heard. You've been holding me like a bird. In Your heart and. You've kept it guarded. Now that I clearly see. You standing next to me. My loneliness has finally found an ending</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). I can't believe. That You're such a part of me. And after all this time You got through. With Your loving ways. And these have been the kindest days. That I've known since I met You</segment2>
		<segment3>So I will say again. All I have ever been. Is walking backwards. Chasing after. Things that will never be. Able to carry me. Anywhere but to the ground below me</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh a love that gets underneath my skin. It goes in and shows me the things I've been missing. All I know is I want it now. I think about the days when I won't feel pain</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
