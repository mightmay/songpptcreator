		<segment1>Osbournes!. Ha ha ha ha ha!. Aie aie aie aie aie aie!</segment1>
		<segment2>Ozzy puts bats down his throat. Real different people live in his home. &quot;Cosby, he's not,&quot; you complain. &quot;He's burned out from drugs and forgets his own name!&quot;. Censors soon start bleeping, &quot;What did he just say?&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>I know enough to tell it's not a statement of faith. I know enough to tell Ozzy may need saved. Let's go</segment3>
		<segment4>I've listened to Priest and I've listened to Cre. I've watched Alice Cooper get saved out of booze. One person's addictions can ruin his soul. But Jesus saved Alice, so you never know. Metal groups still screaming. Why are we so tame?</segment4>
		<segment5>They're going off the trail, but thy ain't insane. They're going off the trail, 'cause we're lazy brains</segment5>
		<segment6>Why don't we think 'bout Romans 1 through 3. You gotta listen to God's Word. Yeah, yeah</segment6>
		<segment7>There was a cola war and Ozzy succumbed. He'll sell Mr. Bubble when MTV's done. Lately, I just am not scared. The devilish Ozzy -- he just isn't there. Maybe he's not really who and what you claimed</segment7>
		<segment8>I know what Ozzy says but he may still change. So don't underestimate God's amazing grace    </segment8>
