		<segment1>for now we drink. from cups of crude offerings. drawn from the wells. of those with real sufferings. for now we hold to thoughts. of great pleasure. stripped of all worth, all dignity. who remembers. not being utopian?. on being utopian</segment1>
		<segment2>watch as the children. march in vast numbers. you had the last chance. but chose all the others. from the allure. of all of your treasures. you're not inclined to think. so you don't remember. not being utopian. on being utopian. la la la la la la la la la la    </segment2>
