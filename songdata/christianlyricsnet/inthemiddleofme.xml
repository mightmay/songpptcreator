		<segment1>I need a little more sunshine in the middle of rain. Need a little more joy in the middle of pain. Need a little more color in the middle of this plain jane</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause I've looked as deep as I can see. And I think I need a little more You in the middle of me</segment2>
		<segment3>I need a little more patience in the middle of stress. I need a little more beauty in the middle of this mess. Need a little more substance in the middle of this emptiness</segment3>
		<segment4>I need more of You and less of me. More of You and a little less insanity. More of You and a little less complexity</segment4>
		<segment5>I've looked as deep as I can see. It seems more of You is better for me</segment5>
		<segment6>I need a little more rhythm in the middle of this lazy rhyme. Need a little more spontaneity in the middle of this daily grind. Need a little more truth, not music, in this world of lies    </segment6>
