		<segment1>Im looking around here for some kind of miracle. Im looking around here for some kind of sign. I gotta believe theres a rhyme and a reason for the faith that you find. I gotta admit theres something I see in you - I know that its something deep inside. But nevertheless, still I cant help but wonder. Would you really even care if I ever say goodbye. Well, youve got love and Ive got time</segment1>
		<segment2>Wont you make a move before I change my mind?</segment2>
		<segment3>And I want to believe its true - Im listening close  wont you make your move now?. I know that theres more to life than Ive ever known. I feel it down deep inside my heart. And Im here now to find what youre believing and to know who you are. And if you care to share a minute of your time with me. Tell me know because I am hoping that I can believe. Give me a reason to trust what youre telling me. Lord knows I need it now, wont you show me how. Well, youve got love and Ive got time</segment3>
		<segment4>Wont you make a move before I change my mind now?</segment4>
		<segment5>And Ill give you a chance to say everything you want before I walk away. Well, I want to believe its true - Im listening close. Wont you make your move?    </segment5>
