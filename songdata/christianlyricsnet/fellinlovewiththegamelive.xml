		<segment1>Put the knife in the table. Deck of cards fly across the room. This game has ended someone needs to die. Cause I put my life on the table but forgot the risk I assume. Now it's going down</segment1>
		<segment2>Fell in love with the game. But I forgot Your name. Go ahead please fight me. Cause I'm not scared. Though You stayed the same. I forgot from where I came</segment2>
		<segment3>I put my life on this table. This is me and I'm lost for words. Now is it me who needs to die. Say something then. Cause I'll be dead before dawn. If Your voice comes unheard. Now I can't find ground</segment3>
		<segment4>Fell in love with the game. But I forgot Your name. Go ahead please fight me. Cause I'm not scared. Though You stayed the same. I forgot from where I came</segment4>
		<segment5>And we both stand tall on the table. You take me by the hand and I grab You by the throat. And we come crashing down through the window. On the dirt ground below. And we wrestle in the mud and the blood and the beer. Break my jaw I don't care. Just stay with me, stay</segment5>
		<segment6>Lock my arms I don't want to move. Hold me still teach me how to weep. If it's ok with You I think I'll stay here. For a little while</segment6>
		<segment7>Fell in love with the game. But I forgot Your name. Go ahead please find me. Cause I'm not scared. Though You stayed the same. I forgot from where I came    </segment7>
