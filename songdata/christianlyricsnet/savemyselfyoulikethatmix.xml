		<segment1>Stop. Take a minute take a breath. From the pressure from the need to know why. What makes you a-li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ive. Why do we rely on ourselves. Putting God up on a shelf we depend. On what's left in our hands. It feels right and we believe. There won't be a suddenly. But we keep running faster. Isn't it so nice to think. If we lived in harmony. There'd be a happy ever after</segment1>
		<segment2>(CHORUS)</segment2>
		<segment3>It doesn't matter if I. Have faith to move a mountain. Drink the ocean dry. Baby, I could never save myself. It doesn't matter if I. Can reach into the deepest. Corners of my mind. Baby, I could never save myself. Stop. We put God in a box. Spend our time watching the clock while we wait. For a release that will take us away. We come down with a crash. But do we have another chance to go back?. Is that gonna make it OK?. Hold your breath and you will see. In the end you'll have to breathe. But we keep running faster. Fast we forget reality. If you fall you're gonna bleed. There is no happy ever after</segment3>
		<segment4>(CHORUS)</segment4>
		<segment5>(BRIDGE)</segment5>
		<segment6>Falling out under sorrow. Glimpses of the past of. What I used to think and. Who I used to be. I'm realizing all this frailty. That I hide in me. It doesn't matter. If I defy the laws of gravity. The mystery. I could neva save myself. It doesn't matter. If I started over. In my own world. I could neva save myself. It doesn't matter if I, if I, if I I I I I</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus 2xs)</segment7>
		<segment8>Save myself. Save myself. Save myself. Save myself     </segment8>
