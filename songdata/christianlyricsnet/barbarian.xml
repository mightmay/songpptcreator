		<segment1>Chaos brings order. Who will you allow to lead you blindly until the end?. You're like a little girl with a stupid crush. We all sing glory. We all choke ourselves with our own ignorance. There is so much more to life than your stupid desires. Nothing is everything, and everything is something. Confused? Troubled?. Finding the meaning is looking through the vivid transparencies. Dance the night away because tomorrow, we will look back and talk about good times now gone forever. Trace lines around the image of your choice. Dance until the end, my friend, and find joy in every living thing. Optimism is not a choice, it's a belief.    </segment1>
