		<segment1>Locked inside this cell of flesh. I sat awaiting an eminent death. The fruitful labor of my sin. Had brought me to what I knew would be the end</segment1>
		<segment2>When I had a debt I couldn't pay. You paid a debt I didn't owe. You gave your life for me that day. So freedom I could know</segment2>
		<segment3>Set me free. From the chains that bound me to my sin. Set me free. From this life that I've been living. Set me free</segment3>
		<segment4>There has never been a time. When Your mercy did not find me. Tangled up in all my sin. And then so faithfully unwind me</segment4>
		<segment5>But just before I slipped away. You heard me when I called Your name. There'll never be a day when You won't come and</segment5>
		<segment6>You are the author and the finisher of the faith in me. I know I can trust in You to come and set me free    </segment6>
