		<segment1>I would never have known. The way it feels to love without the love you showered down upon me. Warm, warm as the sun. Melting away the rain giving me strengh to face another morning. So many times I felt afraid and turn to you to find my way. I reach inside to find you there. You were with me everywhere</segment1>
		<segment2>All. (I could search for all my life to find). It would take all. (Someone to be there till the end of time). All of my life to find. (Everywhere I look I'll never find). Someone more there for me. There for me. And I'm.. ( when I feel like I am all alone). Never Alone. (You are closer than I've ever known). 'cause in my heart I know. ( You're always with me in my heart I know). Your always there for me,there for me</segment2>
		<segment3>I, I won't let go. Of precious memories. They are the light of hope that burns inside me. And every time I lose my way. You shine for me and I'm okay. You lift me way beyond it all. And You never let me fall </segment3>
		<segment4>All. (I could search for all my life to find). It would take all. (Someone to be there till the end of time). All of my life to find. (Everywhere I look I'll never find). Someone more there for me. There for me. And I'm.. ( when I feel like I am all alone). Never Alone. (You are closer than I've ever known). 'cause in my heart I know. ( You're always with me in my heart I know). Your always there for me,there for me</segment4>
		<segment5>You'll always catch me when I fall. All, it would take all. All of my life to find. Someone more there for me, there for me. And I'm never alone. 'Cause in my heart I know. You're always there for me, there for me, I know </segment5>
		<segment6>All. (I could search for all my life to find). It would take all. (Someone to be there till the end of time). All of my life to find. (Everywhere I look I'll never find). Someone more there for me. There for me. And I'm.. ( when I feel like I am all alone). Never Alone. (You are closer than I've ever known). 'cause in my heart I know. ( You're always with me in my heart I know). Your always there for me,there for me I know</segment6>
		<segment7>Your always there. With me everywhere. And if I lose my way. I am never alone. 4x </segment7>
