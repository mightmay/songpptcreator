		<segment3>It goes 1 2 3 and to the 4. Well, this is what happens when hip-hop meets the hardcore. From the stands all the way to the dance floor. Get ya hands up pump it till ya arm sore. Ya better understand now who we rock for. The Son of Man just nothing else nothing more. So make your plans any time that we on tour. It's guaranteed we can and will give ya what ya came for. What's the deal what in the world ya standing there for. C'mon for real I came in here to declare war. I ain't ashamed of the name of who I stand for. Jesus reigns supreme I'll say it till my tongue sore</segment3>
		<segment4>Party people you want to get down. Are ya ready to rock and get down. Show me what ya got then get down. So everybody in the spot get down now </segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus]</segment5>
		<segment6>It goes 1 2 3 and to the 4. We ain't down get ready cuz there's plenty more. Ya better come get this life that we living for. So my man gives these people what they waiting for. Rock, rock, ready to roll. It's also no celebrating out of control. C'mon party people and hit the dance floor. Keep the party rocking till your ears get sore. It sounds too much to ignore. So throw your hands up yo give me some more. We're party on poor let the crowd roar. Cuz me and Bob are here to settle the score. C'mon</segment6>
		<segment7>Party people you want to get down. Are ya ready to rock and get down. Show me what ya got then get down. So everybody in the spot get down now. [Chorus x3]    </segment7>
