		<segment1>Desperate, grasping with a clenched fist. I try to hold my own life in my own hand. Frustration sets in, thought I had this. Failure is the one thing that I just can't stand</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, You remind me that taking care of me. Has never been in my job description. Oh, now I'm finding you want to fix it all. You're just waiting for permission</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I'm giving up, I'm letting go. Of everything that I've held onto. I'm giving up, I'm letting go. Of all the things that I've let hold me. For so long (for so long) Lord I know. I need to give You full control. Help me give up, and let go</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to trust You with my whole heart. Not lean on what I think I understand. And ever when I can't see. Jesus, help me still to believe. You're unveiling an unfailing plan</segment4>
		<segment5>And oh, sometimes the old me creeps back in. And oh, the only thing I know to do is give it all to You again</segment5>
		<segment6>Help me give up, help me let go. Help me give up, help me let go. Help me give it all to You    </segment6>
