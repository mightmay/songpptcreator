		<segment1>you are taking time away from us, discipline becomes necessary, when it's undeserved and incredibly unjust?. and the clock drags razors over naked flesh, cause i can't find a way out of the loneliness, in securities driving nails under my skin, time slowing to a crawl, fear of abandonment tying the noose around my neck, and i pull this veil over my eyes, you'd be happy to punish, because i dipped into her blood, and she spilled me from inside, what can it matter now, thanks to this latent understanding of worthlessness, so you take time away from us, a lack of trust that cuts my throat, my paralysis made by me, fear of abandonment tying the noose around my neck, and i pull this veil over my eyes, this time the bond i've made and given, is stronger than i am, and i can't tell if she's made anything, i thought she needed me because i needed her, arms around each others waists, we soak our pillows and you are all knowing, you are wrong for this, and you take her away from me, you take my happiness away, you take my happiness away, i soak my pillow, and i was all knowing, i was wrong for this, and she left me all alone, did she take my happiness away, or did i forget hot to be happy?. it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me. and i'll finish tonight    </segment1>
