		<segment1>A double minded one. Gazing into two reflections. Who cannot recognize. The vessel or the messenger</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah!</segment2>
		<segment3>Obedience gone and somewhere. Left in the distance. New wilderness. Outstretched hand, broken wrist. Just a little taste of everything you would miss. Could you turn your back on this?</segment3>
		<segment4>Fight, (fight). For our tomorrow. Fall, (to stand). Surrender, to follow (2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>Whoa. It's all. All we'll ever have. Whoa. It's all. All we'll ever need</segment5>
		<segment6> From somewhere far, far away: (I Will avenge, I will repay). A distant voice from some familiar place. (Drive it home in me, pull it out from me). &quot;Let go the anchor. Let got the deadweight. (I will repay, I will avenge), And I'll change what's in remiss&quot;</segment6>
		<segment7>Fight, (fight). For our tomorrow. Fall, (to stand). Surrender, to follow (2x)</segment7>
		<segment8>Whoa. It's all. All we'll ever have. Whoa. It's all. All we'll ever need</segment8>
		<segment9>Will I find home in. This beautiful oblivion?. No meaning. No solace. No comfort. No justice. These thoughts I've held in failure. My paper champion, false savior</segment9>
		<segment10>&quot;You think the answer lies within. When your heart betrays you?&quot;</segment10>
		<segment11>Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah</segment11>
		<segment12> From somewhere far, far away: (I Will avenge, I will repay). A distant voice from some familiar place. (Drive it home in me, pull it out from me). &quot;Let go the anchor. Let got the deadweight. (I will repay, I will avenge), And I'll change what's in remiss&quot;</segment12>
		<segment13>Fight, (fight). For our tomorrow. Fall, (to stand). Surrender, to follow (2x)</segment13>
		<segment14>Whoa. It's all. All we'll ever have. Whoa. It's all. All we'll ever need</segment14>
		<segment15>It's all. All we'll ever have. It's all. All we'll ever need (2x).     </segment15>
