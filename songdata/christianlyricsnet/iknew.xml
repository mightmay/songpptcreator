		<segment1>I wont forget those summer days hangin' out with you. Not a care in the whole world. The nervous tension wouldn't keep me from your side. I knew that this time I had to get it just right. I saw you and I knew, that you were the one for me. I saw you and I knew. On that windy winter night I held you in my arms, the look in your eyes took the words right from my mouth. I could barely speak, my stomach all in knots. Too many butterflies swallowed that night. I saw you and I knew, that you were the one for me. I saw you and I knew. You saw right through me. You leaned in, and said those words and. I saw you and I knew, that you were the one for me. I saw you and I knew.    </segment1>
