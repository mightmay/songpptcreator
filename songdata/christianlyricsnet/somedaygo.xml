		<segment1>I feel the wind blow, does anyone know?. Who it is breathing, sending us hope</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. I see the sun I found warmth, I found warmth in its light. Just like Your eyes I found grace, I found grace in your sight. Someday I'll go, I will see Your face. I will let go of these eyes of faith.</segment2>
		<segment3>Here in the valley, a little confused. I look to the mountains, my help comes from You</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>The clouds roll into my life. And they remind of how You'll meet me in the sky. I feel the wind blow, does anyone know?. Under those clouds, oh where did we go?</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
