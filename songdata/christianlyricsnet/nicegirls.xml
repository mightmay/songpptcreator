		<segment1>Nice girls are out there. With quick wit and long hair. I'm here but she's there. I look but she stares</segment1>
		<segment2>Send me one</segment2>
		<segment3>Nice boys are in bands. They can sing but can't dance. I try to impress but. She laughs at my dress</segment3>
		<segment4>Send me one</segment4>
		<segment5>This song will soon end and. Time's up to pretend. What will be my fate. If I can't land this date</segment5>
