		<segment1>Why is it so hard for me to let go. And why is it so hard for me to dispose. Of all the sin I try to hide. And I run I dont know why. Whats there left for me to do. Youre stealing away every part of my heart. Come and replace all my selfish ways. Alter my world. Every part of my heart. Steal me away. Tell me whos to blame for the sin on my lips. I cant repair the stains that I tried so hard to fix. But You wipe away the stains. And in love You called my name. Now Im running back to You. And I know that I cant last. And I know that I cant last without You.     </segment1>
