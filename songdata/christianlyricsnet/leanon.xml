		<segment1>Into Your hands I commit my spirit. Into Your heart I place mine. Into Your will I submit all I am. As I let go peace I find. And while the background is falling. You'll find a place I can stand </segment1>
		<segment2>Lean on Your understanding. Lean on everything You say. Lean on divine intention. Lean on every word you utter </segment2>
		<segment3>Into Your hands I submit my troubles. Into Your world I'll unfold. And with Your strength I'll replace my weakness. As I lie down Your restore my soul. And while the background is falling. You've found a place I can stand. (in Your heavens, I will ) </segment3>
		<segment4>. Lean on Your understanding. Lean on everything You say. Lean on divine intention. Lean on every word you utter.     </segment4>
