		<segment1>[Verse 1:]. This is my prayer in the desert. When all that's within me feels dry. This is my prayer in the hunger in me. My God is a God who provides. </segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse 2:]. And this is my prayer in the fire. In weakness or trial or pain. There is a faith proved or more worth that gold. So refine me, Lord through the flames </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. I will bring praise. I will bring praise. No weapon formed against me shall remain. I will rejoice. I will declare. God is my victory and He is here </segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 3:]. And this is my prayer in the battle. When triumph is still on it's way. I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ. So firm on His promise I'll stand </segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus:]. I will bring praise. I will bring praise. No weapon formed against me shall remain. I will rejoice. I will declare. God is my victory and He is here </segment5>
		<segment6>[Bridge:]. All of my life. In every season. You are still God. I have a reason to sing. I have a reason to worship </segment6>
		<segment7>[Bridge:]. All of my life. In every season. You are still God. I have a reason to sing. I have a reason to worship </segment7>
		<segment8>[Bridge:]. All of my life. In every season. You are still God. I have a reason to sing. I have a reason to worship </segment8>
		<segment9>[Chorus:]. I will bring praise. I will bring praise. No weapon formed against me shall remain. I will rejoice. I will declare. God is my victory and He is here </segment9>
		<segment10>[Chorus:]. I will bring praise. I will bring praise. No weapon formed against me shall remain. I will rejoice. I will declare. God is my victory and He is here </segment10>
		<segment11>[Verse 4:]. This is my prayer in the harvest. When favor and providence flow. I know I'm filled to be emptied again. The seed I've received I will sow.     </segment11>
