		<segment1>Hey, it's me trying to get closer. But feeling like a chump instead, Is it in my head?. Can I be what you want me to be?. You can walk away so far and I'll be there. Buckle me up, let's go for a ride. It's a mystery what's inside. Give to me what you've been hiding. Or just hurt me. You can let me fall and I'll get up for sure</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm on the wrong side of my head.     </segment2>
