		<segment1>I see You coming closer. I feel You coming near. My heart melts. As I open my door. And all I see. Is You there. Yes my heart cries out</segment1>
		<segment2>I see You, oh my God. And I need You in my heart. I feel You, oh my Lord. And I need You more than ever before</segment2>
		<segment3>Time and time again You save me. Same as this, that I fall. I might as well be rendered helpless. Cause without You, I'm not at all</segment3>
		<segment4>I see You, oh my God. And I need You in my heart. I feel You, oh my Lord. And I need You more than ever before    </segment4>
