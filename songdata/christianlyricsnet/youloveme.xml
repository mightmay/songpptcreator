		<segment1>Advertisers sell me. And TV tries to tell me. That my beauty's skin deep. And it's to my advantage. To pretty up the package. If I want to succeed</segment1>
		<segment2>But somewhere in the quiet. Away from all the noise. I hear a different message. In a still small voice</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). You love me you love me. Just for being me. You love me you love me. You want me to see. It's not about appearance. It's not about my style. No matter what the world is thinking of me. You love me</segment3>
		<segment4>You see my potential. And to get there it's essential. That I follow your lead. There will be distractions. And in all of my reactions. I will need to believe</segment4>
		<segment5>The world will try to change me. To make me look the part. All you really care about. Is what's inside my heart</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>I couldn't face the pressure. If I had to stand alone. Every time I come to you. Lord you let me know</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
