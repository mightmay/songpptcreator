		<segment1>Shaken by a love that makes me. Fall into your arms. Welcome to a place of safety. Where you keep me safe from harm. Im hearing all the sounds around me. But I listen to my heart. Somewhere in the noise you found me. Tripping my alarm. Thank God I lost all my hope. In everything that isnt you. And Ive come much too far. Ill never turn my back on you. Thank God I lost all my hope. In everything that isnt you. Thank God I found you. Fighting complication. Im losing my control. I dont want to keep you waiting. Im ready to let go. Im tuning out the noise    </segment1>
