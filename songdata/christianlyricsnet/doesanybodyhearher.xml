		<segment1> She is running. A hundred miles an hour in the wrong direction. She is trying. But the canyon's ever widening. In the depths of her cold heart. So she sets out on another misadventure just to find. She's another two years older. And she's three more steps behind</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Does anybody hear her?. Can anybody see?. Lord does anybody even know she's going down today?. Under the shadow of our steeple. With all the lost and lonely people. Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me. Does anybody hear her?. Can anybody see?</segment2>
		<segment3>She is yearning. For shelter and affection. That she never found at home. She is searching. For a hero to ride in. To ride in and save the day. And in walks her prince charming. And he knows just what to say. Momentary lapse of reason. And she gives herself away</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>If judgement looms under every steeple. If lofty glances from lofty people. Can't see past her scarlet letter. And we never even met her</segment5>
		<segment6>If judgement looms under every steeple. If lofty glances from lofty people. Can't see past her scarlet letter. And we never even met her</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus 2x</segment7>
		<segment8>He is running a hundred miles an hour in the wrong direction    </segment8>
