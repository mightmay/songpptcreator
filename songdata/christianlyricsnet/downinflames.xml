		<segment1>Christians-- we're all afraid of fire. We prefer to suck on pacifiers. Baby pacifists, we're throwing fits. We don't shake hands, we shake our fists.</segment1>
		<segment2>We're cannibals. We watch our brothers fall. We eat our own, the bones and all.</segment2>
		<segment3>Finally fell asleep on the plane. to wake to see we're going down in flames.</segment3>
		<segment4>We're going down, down, down in flames. We're gonna drown, drown, drown insane.</segment4>
		<segment5>We see the problem and the risk, but nothing's solved. We just say, &quot;Tisk, tisk, tisk,&quot;. and, &quot;Shame, shame, shame.&quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>Finally fell asleep on the plane. to wake to see we're going down in flames.</segment6>
		<segment7>Let's go!</segment7>
		<segment8>Christians-- we mourn, the thorn is stuck. in the side of the body watch it self-destruct. The enemy is much ignored. when we fight this Christian civil war.</segment8>
		<segment9>We're cannibals. We watch our brothers fall. We eat our own, the bones and all.</segment9>
		<segment10>Finally fell asleep on the plane. to wake to see we're going down in flames.</segment10>
		<segment11>We're going down, down, down in flames. We're gonna drown, drown, drown insane.</segment11>
		<segment12>We see the problem and the risk, but nothing's solved. We just say, &quot;Tisk, tisk, tisk,&quot;. and, &quot;Shame, shame, shame.&quot;</segment12>
		<segment13>Finally fell asleep on the plane. to wake to see we're going down in flames.</segment13>
		<segment14>Na na na na, na na na na. Na na na na, na na na na. Na na na na, na na na na. Na na na na, na na na na. Na na na na, na na na na. Na na na na, na na na na. Na na na na, na na na na. Bana na na na, na na na</segment14>
		<segment15>Let me pause to clarify. ('cause I'm sure you're asking, &quot;Why?&quot;). I stand before you and proudly claim. to belong to what this song complains.</segment15>
		<segment16>I'm part of the problem, I confess, But I gotta get this off my chest.</segment16>
		<segment17>Let's extinguish the anguish. for which we're to blame, and save the world. from going down in flames.</segment17>
		<segment18>Let me pause to clarify. ('cause I'm sure you're asking, &quot;Why?&quot;). I stand before you and proudly claim. to belong to what this song complains.</segment18>
		<segment19>I'm part of the problem, I confess, But I gotta get this off my chest.</segment19>
		<segment20>Let's extinguish the anguish. for which we're to blame, and save the world. from going down in flames.    </segment20>
