		<segment1>Don't stop your crying on my account. A frightening lion, no doubt. He's not safe, no he's not safe. Are you tempted now to run away?. The King above all Kings is coming down. But He won't say the words you wish that he would. Oh, he don't do the deeds you know that He could. He won't think the thoughts you think He should. But He is good, He is good. I know you're thirsty, the water is free. But I should warn you, it costs everything. Well, He's not fair, no He's not fair. When He fixes what's beyond repair. And graces everyone that don't deserve. No one knows Him whom eyes never seen. No, I don't know Him but He knows me. He knows me, He knows me. Lay down your layers, shed off your skin. But without His incision, you can't enter in. He cuts deep, yeah He cuts deep. When the risk is great and the talk is cheap. But never leaves a wounded one behind     </segment1>
