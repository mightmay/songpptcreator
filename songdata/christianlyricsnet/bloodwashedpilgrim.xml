		<segment1>I saw a blood washed pilgrim, a sinner saved by grace. Up on the King's great highway, with peaceful shining face. Temptations sore beset him, but nothing could a fright. He said the yoke is easy, the burden it is light</segment1>
		<segment2>Palms of victory, crowns of glory. Palms of victory I shall wear</segment2>
		<segment3>I saw him in the furnace, he neither doubted nor feared. And in the flames beside him the Son of God appeared. Though seven times 'twas heated, with all the tempters might. He said the yoke is easy, the burden it is light</segment3>
		<segment4>I saw him overcoming, through all the swelling strife. I saw him cross the threshold of God's eternal life. The crown, the throne the scepter, the name. The stone so white for those who are found in Jesus. the burden it is light    </segment4>
