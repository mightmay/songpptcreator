		<segment1>I won't be afraid anymore. Of the terrors by night. Or the arrow that flies by day. And though a thousand may fall. At my side. And though ten thousand may fall. In Him I'll put all my trust</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. He who dwells in the secret place. Of the Most High. Shall abide in the shadow. He who dwells in the secret place. Of the Most High. Shall abide in the shadow</segment2>
		<segment3>I will hide in Your wings always. Your angels stand by to keep me. In all my ways. And though a thousand may fall. At my side. I will say in Him I trust</segment3>
		<segment4>(Repeat chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>And though a thousand may fall. At my side. And though ten thousand may fall. I will say of the Lord. That in Him I put all my trust</segment5>
		<segment6>(Repeat chorus)     </segment6>
