		<segment1>There's plenty of time left tonight. I promised I'd have you home before daylight. We do the best we can in a small town, act like big-city kids when the sun goes down. If it's not too late for coffee I'll be at you place in ten. We'll hit that all night diner and then we'll see. There are so many things I have to say. and I'll stay up all night to hear about your day. We do the best we can in a small town. to act like kids in love when the sun goes down. There's a love that transcends all that we've known of ourselves. and I'll wait for it to come. It's got to be strong to touch my heart through it's shell. and I'll wait for it to come.    </segment1>
