		<segment1>All these emotions I go through. I am so in love with you. True love has caught my heart. Girl its more than a feeling</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. True love has come &quot; Wo oh. And swept me away. The big sea of love. We're together forever. You have my heart. You touch me each day. You are daughter of Sarah</segment2>
		<segment3>I never knew why God blessed me. With a woman like you. But now I know His hand's on me. And He knew I needed you</segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus -</segment4>
		<segment5>I will always treasure you. You are there when I need you. It is love that will prevail. And stand the test of time    </segment5>
