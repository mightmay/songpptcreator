		<segment1>You breathe and life begins. You speak and my world makes sense. That's how it is when it comes to You</segment1>
		<segment2>Your mercy has no end You're more than just a friend. It amazes me You feel the way You do. I believe in You, and nothing less. I believe in You can't help myself. You're all the hope, the reason that I need. I believe in You just because. I don't need no one to prove Your love. For all that I have seen. It's easier for me to believe in You</segment2>
		<segment3>You are so beautiful. You are the miracle. That dries the tears and heals the wounded hearts</segment3>
		<segment4>And it's so clear to see. Your hand in everything. You were there for me, there to see me through</segment4>
		<segment5>Through the fire and through the rain. I know Your love for me will never ever change    </segment5>
