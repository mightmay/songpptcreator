		<segment1>You're Here. In My Heart. You're the Light. That Guides Me Through The Dark</segment1>
		<segment2>You Walk Beside Me. The Night Seems Cold. Each Time I Fall. Your Arms Are There To Hold</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: You Walk Beside Me. Giving Strength I've Never Known. I Am Not Alone. You Walk Beside Me</segment3>
		<segment4>You're Here. In My Mind. I talk To You. And All My Fears Unwind. I Know I'm Loved For who I am. You Make Me Wanna Be The Best I can</segment4>
		<segment5>Repeat Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>And I rely on your patience. When I face the unknown. and because of you. I am not alone</segment6>
		<segment7>In the sun, In the rain. Through the good times and the pain. I reach out for your hand. I know that you understand</segment7>
		<segment8>Repeat Chorus    </segment8>
