		<segment1>I hear the Savior say, Thy strength indeed is small!. Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS:Jesus paid it all. All to Him I owe. Sin had left a crimson stain. He washed it white as snow </segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, now indeed I find. Thy power, and Thine alone, Can change the leper's spots. And melt the heart of stone </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>For nothing good have I. Where-by Thy grace to claim. I'll wash my garments white. In the blood of Calvary's Lamb </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>And when before the throne. I stand in Him complete. Jesus died my soul to save. My lips shall still repeat </segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS 2X    </segment8>
