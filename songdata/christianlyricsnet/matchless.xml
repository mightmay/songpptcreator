		<segment1>Son of a Man, Great I am, King of heaven, son of god, you hold the measure of my days. Holy Lamb, spotless Lamb, You are worthy, I am not. Before Your throne I stand amazed</segment1>
		<segment2>Every tongue confess and every knee will bow. To Jesus Christ the Lord forever, hear our praises now</segment2>
		<segment3>Your name is matchless, Your name is priceless. Your name means more than i could know. You're so far above me, the way that you love me. goes further than any love could go</segment3>
		<segment4>Wonderful Counselor, Root of David, morning star. you are the way, the truth, the life. lion of the tribe of judah, Mighty god is who you are. The only perfect sacrifice</segment4>
		<segment5>In your name you took the blind man and you gave him back his sight. In your name you took the dead man and you brought him back to life. In your name you took this prisoner and you opened up the doors. And I will sing before your throne forever more.     </segment5>
