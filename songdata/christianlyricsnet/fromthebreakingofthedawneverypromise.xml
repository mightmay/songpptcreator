		<segment1>From the breaking of the dawn to the setting of the sun, I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. Words of power, strong to save, that will never pass away, I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. For Your covenant is sure, And on this I am secure혰. I can stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.</segment1>
		<segment2>When I stumble and I sin, condemnation pressing in, I will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. You are faithful to forgive that in freedom I might live, So I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. Guilt to innocence restored, You remember sins no more혰. So I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.</segment2>
		<segment3>When I'm faced with anguished choice, I will listen for Your voice, And I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. Through this dark and troubled land. You will guide me with Your hand. As I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. And You've promised to complete. Ev'ry work begun in me혰. So I'll stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.</segment3>
		<segment4>Hope that lifts me from despair, love that casts out ev'ry fear, As I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. Not forsaken, not alone, for the Comforter has come, And I stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word. Grace sufficient, grace for me, Grace for all who will believe혰. We will stand on ev'ry promise of Your Word.     </segment4>
