		<segment1>I am a man. Looking for. Who I really am. And why I sometimes feel. More fake than real. I feel like a man. Hopelessly playing the part. Reading the lines without conviction. Without the heart, give me the heart!</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. You are the one that hung the sun. You are the one that set the moon. You made me</segment2>
		<segment3>I will follow after You. You are the one that filled the sea. You are the grace that carried me. You pulled me through. I will follow after you. Follow after You. Lord strip away. All the lies in the way. And show me how. How to find myself in You, only You</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: I will follow no matter where you lead. Ill keep walking that path in front of me. I will follow no matter where you go. Ill keep running and holding on to the one I know</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Outro: You are the one that called my name    </segment7>
