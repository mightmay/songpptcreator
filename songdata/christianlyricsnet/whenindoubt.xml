		<segment1>Sat upon your bed, You've said the things you've said. And I cannot believe that you seem so naive. We exchanged our poetry, You seem to think a lot like me. I'll guess I'll just assume that we could talk about most anything. Then I ask have you ever felt abandoned?. Felt so lost that you were stranded, Just like all the walls are closing in. And you were left inside. Have you ever felt like your days were numbered?. Stuck under a tree in thunder. Seems to be no way out!. But there is One when in doubt!!!. Ready for another day!. Slowly watch yah waste away, Havin' fun, bein' cool. Like we did in high school, Elementary romance feelin' nervous at the dance, Crack a smile hold it down, Whatever the circumstance, Sex, Drugs, Hadda be cool, All the things we learned in school, Typical teenage machines, Anyone tell me what this means?. I could learn, I could try, Never really had an alibi. Wish I did, that's no lie. (chorus). And you ask why. When you feel like you could fly. Gotta know I got the answer for yah baby, Drives yah crazy it's not over. So much more to life then this, why?. When you feel like you could fly. Gotta know I got the answer for yah baby, Drives yah crazy it's not over. So much more to life then this. Things seem so hallucinary, In the corners of my mind they scare me, I know yah never meant to desert me, Just like yah never really meant to hurt me. Then I ask have you ever felt abandoned?. Felt so lost that you were stranded, Just like all the walls are closing in. And you were left inside. Have you ever felt like your days were numbered?. Stuck under a tree in thunder. Seems to be no way out!. But there is One when in doubt!!!. (chorus). So much more to life than this!!!    </segment1>
