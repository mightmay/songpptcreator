		<segment1>A nation of millions. Of lost little sheep. The mass effects so many. Who believe all they see. The media's children. The people of sleep. Taught to rest in peace. By the whispers of deceit</segment1>
		<segment2>Led to believe. That they're still free to decide. Because the t.v. gave permission. On a program on rights. Fed only the candy. The part that they wanna hear. Slowly raped though they can only feel. The tickle in their ears</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;close your eyes, release your mind.&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>Consider yourselves my very one desire, Consider yourselves my slaves. Consider yourselves at my fingertips, In the palm of my hand, my slave.&quot;. To &quot;leave your thinking to me..&quot;</segment4>
		<segment5>A nation of puppets. Who worship a beast</segment5>
		<segment6>Who drinks the blood of their souls. As they lay at it's feet. If seeing is believeing. Then you can have your t.v. screen. I will worship a God. Who allows me to think    </segment6>
