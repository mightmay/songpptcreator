		<segment1>Stop now. Im overreaching. Once again I think Im in the right. Im trying too hard to let go. How can I let you lead me. If Im a broken satellite. Wandering out on my own</segment1>
		<segment2>We draw the lines. And we cross them too. We dont know what weve done. But its what we do. Dying to become more like You</segment2>
		<segment3>I never meant to disrespect you. But thats exactly what Ive done. What am I trying to prove. When will I stop and trust you. I know that youre the only one. How am I blind to the truth</segment3>
		<segment4>We draw the lines. And we cross them too. We dont know what weve done. But its what we do. Dying to become more like You</segment4>
