		<segment1>I know that everyone's running. Just trying to get away (you, you can't get away). Life can feel a lot like a rat race. Like everyday is so mundane. But I am saying..</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey, hey, oh, oh. I'm not getting caught in the undertow. I'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow. I'm never gonna follow, no</segment2>
		<segment3>Turn it up, make it loud on your radio. We are gonna dance everywhere we go. Everybody knows. That's how we roll</segment3>
		<segment4>Why don't you come on and join us. Take your rose off the grindstone. Take, take your hands off the keyboard. And put down the iPhone. And let me hear you say</segment4>
		<segment5>Hey, hey, oh, oh. We ain't getting caught in the undertow. We'll keep taking it easy and taking it slow. We're never gonna follow, no</segment5>
		<segment6>Turn it up, make it loud on your radio. We are gonna dance everywhere we go. Everybody knows. That's how we roll (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>Don't fold under the pressure. A smile can make it better. Whoa, ya know, ya know, yeah. Don't fold under the pressure. A smile can make it better. And if everything goes wrong. Keep singing this song</segment7>
		<segment8>Turn it up, make it loud. You, you can't get away. Don't, don't try to get away. Turn it up, make it loud. You, you can't get away. Don't, don't try to get away, oh no</segment8>
		<segment9>Turn it up, make it loud on your radio. We are gonna dance everywhere we go. Everybody knows. That's how we roll(2x)</segment9>
