Cause she can't shoot whiskey. Right now he's probably up  behind her with a pool stick showing. Her how to shoot a combo. And he don't know</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: That I dug my key into the side. Of his pretty little suped up four wheel drive. Carved my name into his leather seats. I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights. Slashed a hole in all four tires. Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats</segment2>
		<segment3>Right now she's probably up singing some white trash version of Shania karaoke. Right now she's probably saying I 'm drunk and he's thinking that he's gonna get lucky. Right now he's probably dabbing on three dollars worth of that bathroom polo. And he don't know</segment3>
