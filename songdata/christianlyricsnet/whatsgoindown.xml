		<segment1>Welcome to the world of a kid named Mikey. Who had only one reason to be hated be whitey. Raised on a farm outside of South Bend. Where they hated on him cause he was African American. But three years later, Mikey was the town pride. Basketball Mikey went and got himself a full ride. Earned his acceptance on the hardwood floor. And that's something white America would never ignore</segment1>
		<segment2>Stop, hey, what's that sound. Everybody look what's goin' down. Stop, hey, what's that sound. Everybody look what's goin' down</segment2>
		<segment3>What's goin' down tell me what's goin' down. You wanna know just what's goin' down. What's goin' down I'll tell ya what's goin' down. You wanna know just what's goin' down</segment3>
		<segment4>Take a look around. Everything is comin' down. Do you hear the subtle sounds. Of our morality slippin'. People on the go. We'll be reapin' what we sow. Yeah we say we want to know. But I got my suspicions</segment4>
		<segment5>Welcome to the world of a girl named Susie. Susie's only crime was that she was born a cutie. Physically abused by her uncle and his friends. Alcohol let em all leave the house with grins. But Susie couldn't shake off the memories. Forced to find her own kind of remedy. A man-eater for the rest of her days. Three kids, three men, no daddies by eleventh grade</segment5>
