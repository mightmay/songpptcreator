		<segment1>SomethingÂ’s different. Something I can't explain. Can you feel it? Can you hear it?. The sound of heaven. Is pouring on us like rain. Nothing is the same</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. Fresh anointing fall. Let it overflow. On every heart and soul. Holy Spirit come. Come and make us new. All we want is You, only You. You are all. Fresh anointing fall</segment2>
		<segment3>Hands are lifted. We are singing Your name. Can you feel it? Can you hear it?. The song of freedom. Is spreading just like a flame. It can't be contained</segment3>
		<segment4>[Repeat Chorus:]</segment4>
		<segment5>Throw away the old. We are on our knees. Let the new unfold. God, we want to see Your fresh anointing fall</segment5>
		<segment6>[Repeat Chorus:]    </segment6>
