		<segment1>the mistakes I've made. that caused pain. I could have done without. all my selfish thought. all my pride. the things I hide. you have forgot about. they're all behind you. they'll never find you. they're on the ocean floor. your sins are forgotten. they're on the bottom. of the ocean floor. my misdeeds. all my greed. all the things that haunt me now. they're not a pretty sight to see. but they're wiped away. by a mighty, mighty wave. a mighty, mighty wave. your sins are erased. and they are no more. they're out on the ocean floor. take them away. to return no more. take them away. to the ocean floor     </segment1>
