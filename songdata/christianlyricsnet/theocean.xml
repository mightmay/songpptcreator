		<segment1>Am I alone in this?. Never a night where I can sleep myself till day. We must try to figure it out, figure it out. It won't be that easy. We lost it somehow. You come over unannounced. Silence broken by your voice in the dark. I need you here tonight. Just like the ocean needs the waves. Oh, the night becomes the space thats somewhere in between. What I feel and what I'm taught. Sitting on the shoreline trying to figure it out, figure it out. To find out the meaning and reach it somehow. You come over announced. Silence broken by your voice in the dark. I need you here tonight. Just like the ocean needs the wave. Fall aroud me now, like stars that shine and brigthen the way. I need you here tonight just like this night it needs the rain. The season has changed. The wind, it moves colder now, colder now. The coulds are raised, the rain it falls harder now, all around. You come over announced. Silence broken by your voice in the dark. I need you here tonight, just like the ocean needs the waves. So fall around me now. Just like stars that shine and brigthen the way. I need you here tonight just liek this night it needs the rain. Over announced, silence broken by your voice in the dark. I need you here tonight, just like the ocean needs the waves. Just like the stars that fall around me now. </segment1>
