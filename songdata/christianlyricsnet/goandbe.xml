		<segment1>you're like a letter that's never mailed. you're like a hammer without a nail. you've been standing in this place for far too long</segment1>
		<segment2>you come to the table and you get fed. then you hide it inside your head. so why not open up and start to run</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). go and be. nothing less than you. 'cause you begin in Him. He'll show you what you need to know. to go and be. every single day. go and be</segment3>
		<segment4>you're like a winner without a prize. like a bird without a sky. you're not into the race until you run</segment4>
		<segment5>so run with your life and you will find. all the things that you leave behind. don't mean that much when everything's brand new</segment5>
		<segment6>go and be. nothing less than you. cause you begin in Him. He'll show you what you need to know. to go and be. every single day. who you are in Him. go and be</segment6>
		<segment7>will you be the one. to come and see. will you be the one. to go and be</segment7>
		<segment8>go and be. nothing less than you. cause you begin in Him. He'll show you what you need to know. to go and be. every single day. who you are in Him. one who loves as Jesus loves</segment8>
		<segment9> now go and be. nothing less than you. go and be. nothing less than true. would you come and see. all there is to be. come and see. go and be</segment9>
		<segment10>(I will go.. I'm goin' now.. I'll be goin' now..)    </segment10>
