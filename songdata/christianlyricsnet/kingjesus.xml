		<segment1>All creation shook on that very day the Lamb was slain. Then redemption came to anyone who would call His name. With power and with strength You broke these heavy chains. And salvation reigned. And with a shout of praise and with our voices raised</segment1>
		<segment2>King Jesus. Your are victorious. You have conquered death. With this life of love. King Jesus. You are victorious. You paid the final debt. For all of us. King Jesus. You are victorious</segment2>
		<segment3>None can separate the very hope and grace that He displayed. Neither height nor depth or anyone can steal the love He gave. And with a shout of praise and with our voices raised</segment3>
		<segment4>One day every knee will bow. And behold You in your glory. And every tongue declare Your Holy name. King Jesus You are victorious    </segment4>
