		<segment1>forgive me if i've been. confused between the means and end. i forgot to be a brother and a friend. covered up inside. sometimes it's harder to know. i have failed at this scenario</segment1>
		<segment2>my faults do run deep. your mercies do run deeper</segment2>
		<segment3>so i knelt tonight. and felt that in somebody's mind. there's a memory of a balance met. but i left less than sublime. there's no credit line. no net worth to show. i can pay for this scenario</segment3>
		<segment4>deepest apologies and sincere regret. for carrying this debt</segment4>
		<segment5>this scenario returns me to where i began. losing what was mine and finding out. a shortcut is a sin.    </segment5>
