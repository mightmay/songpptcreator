		<segment1>Burn, Satan, burn. Burn, Satan, burn</segment1>
		<segment2>The separations coming, the sheep from the goats. There are only two sides, no inbetweeners hope</segment2>
		<segment3>For all our friends that you've got hold. And made them slaves they don't know. For them I will not sin in ceasing to pray. But I'll be glad when your damned, time will not delay</segment3>
		<segment4>Burn, Satan, burn. Burn, Satan, burn</segment4>
		<segment5>The separations coming, the sheep from the goats. There are only two sides, no inbetweeners hope</segment5>
		<segment6>For now we must deal with it as it is unto this day. We wrestle not against flesh and blood, so we'll be glad to say</segment6>
		<segment7>Burn, Satan, burn. Burn, Satan, burn    </segment7>
