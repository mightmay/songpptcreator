		<segment1>You've been having trouble staying asleep. You been waking up at 4:12. You roll the voices over in your head. Then you try to put them neatly on the shelf</segment1>
		<segment2>You watch the sun rise. Saw the darkness had no choice before the dawn. With your own eyes. And then you broke out laughing from a yawn</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm so sorry I've been so down. I started doubting things could ever turn around. And I began to believe that all we are is material. It's nonsensical</segment3>
		<segment4>So you walk outside and everything's new. You're looking at the world with new eyes. As if you'd never seen the sky before this blue. As if you've never seen the sky in your whole life. And then the phone rings. As it turns out you are already late. And now you're wondering. Is peace just a temporary state</segment4>
		<segment5>Waiting tables and parking cars. You've been selling cell phones at the shopping mall. And you began to believe that all you are is material. It's nonsensical</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm so sorry I've been so down. I started doubting things could ever turn around. But I still can't believe that all we are. And that all of our dreams are nothing more than material. Souls aren't built of stone. Sticks and bones</segment6>
		<segment7>Souls aren't built of stone. Souls aren't built of stone, sticks and bones. (repeat 8X)    </segment7>
