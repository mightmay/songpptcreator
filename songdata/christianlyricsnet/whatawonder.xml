		<segment1>You give hope to the hopeless. You give faith to the faithless. Your love comes through. Like the morning light. You give grace to the humble. And have mercy on the merciful. This world's never seen anybody like You</segment1>
		<segment2>O what a wonder. A wonder You are. You hide the sun and let it rain. O what a wonder. Jesus what a wonder You are. O what a wonder. A wonder You are. To save somebody like me. O what a wonder. Jesus what a wonder You are</segment2>
		<segment3>You bring healing to the nations. There's no other salvation. You're the only One who can turn it around. You make a way for the wanderer. You give freedom to the prisoner. All of hell must tremble. At the sound of Your name</segment3>
		<segment4>O what a wonder. Jesus what a wonder You are. O what a wonder You are    </segment4>
