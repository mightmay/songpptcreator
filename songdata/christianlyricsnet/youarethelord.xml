		<segment1>You open your eyes. And we see into Your kingdom. The promise of grace. And You lead us into freedom. We're bound in Your love. And all sin has been forgotten. At the foot of the cross. Where our ransom has been given</segment1>
		<segment2>If God is for us who can be against us. Who can be against our GOD</segment2>
		<segment3>Let all your people raise their voices. Now as Your glory fills this place. Heaven and earth will not be silent. For You are the Lord that is Your name. Yes You are the Lord that is Your name</segment3>
		<segment4>You give life to us all. And you breathe on us Your spirit. We will walk in Your ways. As a light unto the nations. You go before us Father you protect us. Father you provide for us all</segment4>
		<segment5>Your name Oh Lord is a rushing wind. Your Word is a shelter strong within. My portion and my deliverance. Oh, Jesus. Let all Your people raise their voices. Now as your glory fills this place. Heaven and earth will not be silent. For You are the Lord that is Your name. Yes You are the Lord that is Your name. For You are the Lord that is Your name. Yes You are the Lord that is Your name    </segment5>
