		<segment1>unless you can part my ribs like the sea. and make stone beat, then there's no hope for me</segment1>
		<segment2>unless the east never meets the west. unless you set my sin between your shoulderblades. and forget</segment2>
		<segment3>part my ribs like the sea and change me. 'cause stone doesn't beat. and rock hearts don't pump anything. but I've grown not to mind because at least. stone doesn't sling like blood. or spill like guts across the floor. where the bloodsuckers want more and more and more    </segment3>
