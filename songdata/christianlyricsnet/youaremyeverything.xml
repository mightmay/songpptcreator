		<segment1>When my head is spinnin' 'round. This whole world has brought me down. There is one thing I know. When my life is screamin' loud. I look up towards the clouds. Your grace lets me know. Your grace lets me know</segment1>
		<segment2>I am alive because You said. I could be. I'm not alone because Your love. Is everything I need. When my world comes crashin' down. There's just one thing I've found. You are, You are. My everything</segment2>
		<segment3>With every ounce of my soul. I wanna let You know. It's in You, I'm found. With every beat of my heart. I know that You're giving me a start. One that is brand new. Now I'm callin' out to You</segment3>
		<segment4>I am alive because You said. I could be. I'm not alone because Your love. Is everything I need. When my world comes crashin' down. There's just one thing I've found. You are, You are. My everything</segment4>
		<segment5>My everything. In my day, You're everything. In my night, You're everything. In my world, You're everything. In my heart, You're everything. In my soul, You're everything. In my life, You're everything</segment5>
		<segment6>I am alive because You said. I could be. I'm not alone because Your love. Is everything I need. When my world comes crashin' down. There's just one thing I've found. You are, You are. My everything</segment6>
		<segment7>HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYY!. You're my everything. HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYY!    </segment7>
