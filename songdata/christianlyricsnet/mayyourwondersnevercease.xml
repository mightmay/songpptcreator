The universe declares Your majesty. You are holy, holy. Lord of Heaven and Earth. Lord of Heaven and Earth. Early in the morning. I will celebrate the light. when I stumble in the darkness. I will call Your name by night. Hallelujah, to the Lord of Heaven and Earth. Hallelujah, to the Lord of Heaven and Earth. Hallelujah, to the Lord of Heaven and Earth. God of wonders. Beyond our galaxy. You are holy, holy. Precious Lord, reveal Your heart to me. Father, holy, holy. The universe declares Your majesty. You are holy, yes You are. Lord You are. Jesus is holy. Hallelujah, to the Lord of Heaven and Earth. .    </segment1>
