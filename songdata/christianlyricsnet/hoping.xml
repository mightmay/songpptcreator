		<segment1>Every time I try to make it happen. I just fake it. I think its over. And I blink, its over. Every time I screw up. I never let up. And I keep forgetting to think it over. Cuz I blink, its over</segment1>
		<segment2>Every time I close my eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>I sit there hoping. You go on holding my hand in Yours. So stay, yeah stay forever</segment3>
		<segment4>Every day its getting colder. And I find Im getting older. Need warmer climes now. Need a land with warming sun. And a heart whose every beat is one. That keeps Your time. Keeps Your time somehow</segment4>
		<segment5>Every time I close my eyes</segment5>
		<segment6>I sit there hoping. You go on holding my hand in Yours. So stay, yeah stay forever    </segment6>
