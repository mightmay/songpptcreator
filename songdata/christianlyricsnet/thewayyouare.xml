		<segment1>Until You came I was just the same. As everybody else. Whoever saw the light and turned away</segment1>
		<segment2>You love me now. You loved me then. And every now and then. You show me how it would be if I'd gone the other way</segment2>
		<segment3>After all this time I've come to find my soul's fragility. But You've rectified my frailty by your strength</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: It's like the sun swallowed up by the earth. Like atomics bombs in reverse. As if a glass could contain the sea. That's the way You are in me. That's the way You are</segment4>
		<segment5>Now here I stand looking back. To the way things used to be. But I will never be alone again</segment5>
		<segment6>You're with me. And now I see. What it means to me. To be a part of such a mystery</segment6>
		<segment7>After all this time I've come to find my soul's fragility. But You've rectified my frailty by your strength</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
