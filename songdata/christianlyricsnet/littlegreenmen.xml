		<segment1>Out of the playground's ashes. Come little men with little games. They're playing war. They're planning new crusades like new arcades. The reason for the season is to flood the media. With suicidal mania. And paint this landscape with this human waste</segment1>
		<segment2>So lets all sing a song of love. Lets sing sing sing sing. Sing until our throats bleed</segment2>
		<segment3>And if this child could sing he would say: I don't need anybody. I don't need anyone. I don't need your guidance home. Watch as I build my empire. Watch as I rise and fall. Watch as I fight all alone</segment3>
		<segment4>History's a stage for re-runs. For 3 A.M. insomniacs who quote the episodes. If tricycles came with guns we'd all be safe. Little green men didn't come from outer space. With coupons in the Sunday Paper. They came from corporate brains</segment4>
		<segment5>So until we all confess. And admit we stole the candy. These little men are playing games. From here to eternity. But I'll be sitting by myself here. Waiting oh so patiently. Waiting for the sky to fall. And purge frail humanity    </segment5>
