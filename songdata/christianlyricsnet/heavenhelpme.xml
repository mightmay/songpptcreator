		<segment1>I don't wanna live tomorrow. For another rainy day. I don't wanna say I'm sorry. If I can avoid the pain. I don't wanna gain the whole world. Just to turn and lose it all. Cause when it's time to jump I don't wanna guess. If You' ll gonna help break the fall. If there's any hope around. Heaven help me now. Heaven help me now I lift You up and I lay me down. Heaven help me now. I don't wanna sing Your praises. Just to hear 'em on the radio. I don't wanna stand for justice. If I'm not among the poor. I don't wanna claim to know You. If your name's not on my heart. Cause when it's time to go. I don't wanna look back. Just to see I was playin' a part. If there's any hope around. Heaven help me now. Heaven help me now. I lift You up and I lay me down Heaven help me now. Heaven help me now (I believe, I believe, I believe). Heaven help me now (I believe, I believe, I believe). I believe You can help me now (I believe, I believe, I believe). I believe You can help me now (I believe, I believe, I believe). Everybody's quoting the bible. Like it could be truth or lies. And I'm standing on the corner. With the saints and the sinners. Tryin' to quote Your love. With my life. Heaven help me now. Heaven help me now. I lift You up and I lay me down. Heaven help me now. Heaven help me now (I believe, I believe, I believe). Heaven help me now (I believe, I believe, I believe). Oh heaven help me now    </segment1>
