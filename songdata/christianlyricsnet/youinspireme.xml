		<segment1>Hear the roar of the ocean. Feel the waves at my feet. I'm looking over my shoulder. At the mountain peaks. There's a bird that is whistling. What a wonderful world. And I am so amazed. I have to sing Your praise</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Cause You. You inspire me, yeah. I see Your reflection in everything (everything). You're moving me. Like a melody whoa. You inspire me. Yeah</segment2>
		<segment3>Well the driving rain. Sets the beat. The wind is howling a harmony. The clouds roll away. The sun shines a chorus. Your creation sings the words. To songs I've never heard</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE: I want to live a life with passion. That always points to You. Share a love that is wreckless and untamed. Cause You've sketched the world in wonder. And You draw it out of me. The Heavens declare Your glory. And I want to do the same yeah, yeah. Oh Lord, help me do the same    </segment4>
