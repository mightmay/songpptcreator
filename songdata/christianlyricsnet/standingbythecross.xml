		<segment1> Sweet the moments, rich in blessing. Which before the cross I spend. Life and health and peace possessing. From the sinners only Friend</segment1>
		<segment2>Here I'll rest forever viewing. Mercy poured in streams of blood. Precious drops my soul bedewing. Plead and claim my peace with God</segment2>
		<segment3>Standing by the cross. The cross of Calvary. Looking up to my sweet Jesus. Mercy given full and free</segment3>
		<segment4>Truly blessed is the station. Low before His cross to lie. While I see divine compassion. Beaming in his gracious eye</segment4>
		<segment5>Here I feel my sins forgiven. While upon the Lamb I gaze. And my thoughts are all of heaven. And my lips overflow with praise</segment5>
		<segment6>Standing by the cross. The Cross of Calvary. Looking up to my sweet Jesus. Mercy given full and free    </segment6>
