		<segment1>Does time go by?. Was there a day, when my love just wasn't quite enough?. Was there ever a day I did not care?. Have I ever shown you otherwise?. I could not possibly love you more. But once again you've shown me I was wrong.. Cause every day I see your face, your beautiful green eyes, I find I love you more. I have traveled this land, and I've seen a lot. There's nothing I've that could prepare..The deepest ocean. The fire in the sunset. I've never seen anything like them. I saw you and they could not compare. Once again you've shown me I was wrong.. Cause every day I see your face, you're beautiful green eyes, I find I love you more.    </segment1>
