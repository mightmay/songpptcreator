		<segment1>Making promises come easy. Back when they first fell in love. They talked of how theyd share the years together. Said well work it out whatever comes. I guess we never know just how it happens. Vows forgotten that were once so true. Holding on to broken dreams and promises. Its time to act on what they said they would do</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause when its all said and done. Its got to be all or none. Words are no good unless theyre backed with actions. Its easier said than done. Talk of the race and never run. But the prize belongs to those whove said and done</segment2>
		<segment3>Love is one of many pages. In a story only time will tell. Its a book of all the words were saying. Read by those who see us do as well</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause when its all said and done. Its got to be all or none. Words are no good unless theyre backed with actions. Its easier said than done. Talk of the race and never run. But the prize belongs to those whove said and done</segment4>
		<segment5>When its all said and done. Have you done what you said. When its all said and done. Have you done what you said you would do.     </segment5>
