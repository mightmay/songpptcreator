		<segment1>Forever seems so distant. Much further than today. You turn around and in an instant. You find that you are just as far from yesterday. The day it feels like winter. The night it feels like stone. You turn around and you remember. When you're surrounded. You can still feel so alone</segment1>
		<segment2>But it's in between the start and end. I find myself once again. Questioning this place. Calling out your name. San Angelo. What do you know. And tell me do you have something to say. Don't get me wrong. But I miss my home. And it feels like I'm a million miles away. San Angelo. Why do I ask these questions. How come I have these doubts. Cause I find every situation. It always seems to have. It's way of working out</segment2>
		<segment3>But it's in between the start and end. I find myself once again. Questioning this place. Calling out your name.     </segment3>
