		<segment1>rays of light that pierce through leaves fall on our skin. we are are allowed. we look skyward. his hands are glorious. maker of all. we are attached to his every work. wind moves through our hair. oh God, we feel your spirit shining on us. you're so beautiful. one chance to live this life. one chance to sacrifice. this treasure is wonderful. how could they be so numb. rays of light that pierce through leaves fall on our bodies. we are allowed. we are skyborn. his hands are strong. maker of all. we are attached to his every work. how could they be so numb not to see this?. how could they love greed and not want this?. how could they be so dead not to live this?. how could they be so empty not to love this.. not to love this precious life?    </segment1>
