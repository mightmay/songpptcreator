		<segment1>I remember the day when the mojo ran away. You say you're here to back us going down that way. You're the one whose ratting on these cards of plenty. 12 has come and none are ready. You're thumb is working on another victory. No telling officer. I've had my card</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Deep tricks and Tivo inculded. Just to tell them all I want to be an air force pilot. Roll it on and roll it on. And don't forget. Your treason for reason you haven't get</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord had a dream, cash trip. OH NO!. Love is a word. Plus and you're all going up. We'll become quite and count alone. What's happened to the photograph you must have show?</segment3>
		<segment4>[Second Chorus]. Deep tricks and Tvio inculded. Just that right now I want to be an air force pilot. Roll it on and roll it on. And don't forget. Your day jobs for midgets to let them jam</segment4>
		<segment5>[Bridge]. Why help warning you?. I was warning you. To help warning you. WHAT ARE YOU DOING!</segment5>
		<segment6>[Outro]. Deep tricks and Tvio included. And roll it on. Deep tricks and Tvio included. And roll it on. Deep tricks and Tvio included. And roll it on. Gave back the picture to her    </segment6>
