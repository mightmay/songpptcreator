		<segment1>The shadows are dark with loneliness and in them we are searching. It's all we've ever known and the strength we need has been hidden. Heaven help us. We're only human. I'm not sure if we can make it. Heaven help us. We need more than just enough. Your presence is required. Determined to find what we're searching for. We're weak and can only hold on for so long. Heaven help us. We're only human. Heaven help us. Waiting for something. Heaven help us. Waiting for something. Heaven help us. More of you, more of you. Like a drug, we crave you for our addiction. Even in your hands, it's so hard to feel your grasp around us.    </segment1>
