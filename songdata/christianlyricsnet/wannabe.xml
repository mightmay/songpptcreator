		<segment1>I was just walking home. IPod and my headphones on. Thinking bout who I wanna be. TV, magazines and the billboards. All say I'd be cool if I had more. But that's a lie I must ignore</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). This world just keeps on trying. But it aint satisfying. This hunger in my soul. Cause they dont even know. That my identity. Is more than what they see. Its in the One who came to set me free. So I can be who I wannabe</segment2>
		<segment3>Gotta friend lives down the road. Livin' life like a TV show. But his big ol' house is not a home (nah nah nah nah). Gotta Benz, got friends but he's not sure. Would they be there if he was poor. Thats not the life I'm looking for    </segment3>
