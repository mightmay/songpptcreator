		<segment1>Give me eyes to see more of who You are, May what I behold steal my anxious heart, Take what I have known and break it all apart</segment1>
		<segment2>For You, my God, are greater still</segment2>
		<segment3>And no sky contains, no doubt restrains all You are, the greatness of our God. I've spent my life to know that I'm far from close to all You are, the greatness of our God</segment3>
		<segment4>Give me grace to see beyond this moment here, to believe that there is nothing left to fear. And You were on it, high above it all,</segment4>
		<segment5>And You, my God, are greater still</segment5>
		<segment6>And no sky contains, no doubt restrains all You are, the greatness of our God. I've spent my life to know that I'm far from close to all You are, the greatness of our God</segment6>
		<segment7>To all You are, the greatness of our God</segment7>
		<segment8>And there is nothing that could ever separate us, No, there is nothing that could ever separate us from Your love.</segment8>
		<segment9>No life, no death, of this I am convinced. You, my God, are greater still.</segment9>
		<segment10>And no words can say, or song convey all You are, the greatness of our God</segment10>
		<segment11>I'll spend my life to know. that I'm far from close to all You are, the greatness of our God</segment11>
		<segment12>No sky contains, no doubt restrains all You are, the Greatness of Our God. I'll spend my life to know and I'm far from close to all You are, the greatness of our God. to all You are, the greatness of our God. yeah, ay ay ay</segment12>
		<segment13>So give me eyes to see more of who You are..     </segment13>
