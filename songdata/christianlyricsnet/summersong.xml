		<segment1>(chorus). its a cool break, u know I cant wait. every day's like a Sunday and we're. hearing the radio playing. take the long way. under the sun to our cool summer song </segment1>
		<segment2>sun is rising and the day is here. we'll celebrate so don't be late, the time is near. grab your friends and like a rocket we're there. to where the party charges up every year. where we laugh forever </segment2>
		<segment3>taste the perfect weather. everyone together. pack your bags for the memories we make. so lets jet out today </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>cruising underneath a cloudless sky. when we feel the sand, we know we've arrived. everyday and every wave's a sweet ride. we will take out time until the tide says goodbye. we will all remember </segment5>
		<segment6>these days are just like heaven. in our minds we fly there. pack ur bags for the memories we make. so lets jet out today. (chorus) </segment6>
		<segment7>cool summer song. good times we love. like heaven forever. the purest perfection </segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus).     </segment8>
