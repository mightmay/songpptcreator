		<segment1>When you're lost and all alone. I will be your sure way home. When your left out in the cold. I will be your shelter from the storm. When you're clouded by your doubts. You're surrounded and there's no other way out. I will be all that you need. And I'm here for the asking</segment1>
		<segment2>Let me be your everything. Let me be your everything. Look at all that I will bring. In exchange for what you have</segment2>
		<segment3>Bring your sorrow bring your shame. All your suffering and your pain. Don't you know the price is paid. If only you'll let me be. Let me be your everything</segment3>
		<segment4>When you're wandering in the darkness. I will be the light that guides you. And when death is standing at your doorway. I will be the life inside you</segment4>
		<segment5>When you face your deepest fears. When you can't see thru all the tears. I will stay throughout the years. So patiently waiting. Hear me saying</segment5>
		<segment6>Neither height or depth, nor life or death. The angels above or the demons beneath the sea. Could ever separate you from. The love in me, so won't you let me be    </segment6>
