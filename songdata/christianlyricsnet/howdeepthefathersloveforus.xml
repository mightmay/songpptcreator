		<segment1>How deep the fathers love for us. How vast beyond all measure. That He should give his only son And make a wretch His treasure. How great the pain of searing loss The Father turns His face away. As wounds which mar the Chosen One Bring many son's to glory</segment1>
		<segment2>Behold the Man upon the cross my sin upon His shoulder. Ashamed I hear my mocking voice call out amoung the scoffers. It was my sin that held Him there until it was accomplished. His dying breath has brought me life I know that it is finished</segment2>
		<segment3>I will not boast in anything no gifts no power no wisdom. But I will boast in Jesus Christ His death and resurrection. Why should I from His reward I cannot give an answer. But this I know with all my heart His wounds have paid my ransom    </segment3>
