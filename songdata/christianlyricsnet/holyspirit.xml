Chorus: Holy Spirit, we cry to You. Holy Spirit, in this place. Holy Spirit, we cry to You. Come down on us like a flame.  Whoa, like a flame. Read about Him in the Bible. He was in the men of God. And though I don't deserve it, He is in me. You can feel a new revival. Ask Jesus in your heart. And you'll feel so free..yeah. Holy Spirit, we cry to You. Holy Spirit, in this place. Holy Spirit, give us comfort. Come down on us, like a flame. (Bridge) You've got to feel it, oh to believe it. You've got to feel it, oh to believe it. You've got to see it, won't you receive Him. Why don't you believe Him?. Holy Spirit, we cry to You. Holy Spirit, in this place. Holy Spirit, give us comfort. Come down on us like a flame, like a flame. Holy Spirit, we cry to You.
