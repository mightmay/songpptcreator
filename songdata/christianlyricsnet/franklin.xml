		<segment1>And when we get home, I know we won't be home at all. This place we live, it is not where we belong. And I miss who we were in the town that we could call our own. Going back to get away after everything has changed</segment1>
		<segment2>Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive?. (Everything has changed). Do you remember that? Do you remember that?. (Everything has changed). Could you help me push aside all that I have left behind?. (Everything has changed). Do you remember that? Do you remember that?</segment2>
		<segment3>So we stand here now and no one knows us at all. I won't get used to this. I won't get used to being gone. And going back won't feel the same if we aren't staying. Going back to get away after everything has changed</segment3>
		<segment4>Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive?. (Everything has changed). Do you remember that? Do you remember that?. (Everything has changed). Could you help me push aside all that I have left behind?. (Everything has changed). Do you remember that? Do you remember that?</segment4>
		<segment5>Taking up our time. Taking up our time. Taking up our time. It's taking up our time again. Go back we can't go back at all. It's taking up our time again. Go back we can't go back at all. It's taking up our time again. Go back we can't go back at all. It's taking up our time, taking up our time</segment5>
		<segment6>Could you remind me of a time when we were so alive?. Do you remember that? Do you remember that?    </segment6>
