		<segment7>Amazing grace how sweet the sound I once was lost but now Im found. I once was blind but now I see amazing grace has RESCUED me. Amazing grace how sweet the sound I once was lost but now Im found. I once was blind but now I see amazing grace has REACHED TO me. Amazing grace how sweet the sound I once was lost but now Im found. I once was blind now I see amazing grace has COVERED me, its covered me    </segment7>
