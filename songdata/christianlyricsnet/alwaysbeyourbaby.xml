		<segment1>You were my first love, always there for me. You taught me how to walk and how to dream. God gave me your eyes. But it was you who taught me how to see. Now I can stand on my own. But I know that you'll never let go </segment1>
		<segment2>I'll always be your baby. No matter how the years fly by. The way you love me made me. Who I am in this world. I'm a woman now, not a little girl. Wherever this life takes me. I'll always be your baby</segment2>
		<segment3>You are my hero and that will never change. You still can dry my tears with just a smile. The one I've leaned on. From my first steps to walking down the aisle. Now there's another man in my life. But I know by the look in your eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll always be your baby. No matter how the years fly by. The way you love me made me. Who I am in this world. I'm a woman now, Not a little girl. Wherever this life takes me. I'll always be your baby</segment4>
		<segment5>Your faith, your love. And all that you believe. Have come to be the strongest part of me. And I will always be your baby    </segment5>
