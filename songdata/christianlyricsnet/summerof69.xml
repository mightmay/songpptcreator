		<segment1>I got my first real six-string. Bought it at the five and dime. Played it till my fingers bled. It was the summer of '69. Me and some guys from school. Had a band and we tried real hard. Jimmy quit and Joey got married. I shoulda known we'd never get far. Oh when I look back now. That summer seemed to last forever. And if I had the choice. Yeah - I'd always wanna be there. Those were the best days of my life. Back in the summer of '69. Ain't no use in complaining. When you got a job to do. Spent my evenings down at the drive-in. And that's when I met you. Standin' on your mama's porch. You told me that you'd wait forever. Oh and when you held my hand. I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life. Back in the summer of '69. Man we were killining time. We were young and restless. We needed to unwind. I guess nothin' can last forever - forever, no. And now the times are changing. Look at everything that's come and gone. Sometimes I play that old six-string. I think about ya wonder what went wrong. Standing on your mama's porch. You told me it would last forever. The way you held my hand. I knew that it was now or never. Those were the best days of my life. Back in the summer of '69.     </segment1>
