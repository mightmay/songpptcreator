		<segment1>In a world of fate. Where no one seems to care. I feel so afraid but you are always there. When time stands still. And no one is around. You are there standing my ground</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause I can feel you change my heart. You've overwhelmed me from the start. I can feel you change my mind for the better of mankind</segment2>
		<segment3>You only take what's yours. Heaven knows I take much more. Shadows overcome my soul know you're here    </segment3>
