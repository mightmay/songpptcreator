		<segment1>If my faults are your song. Then I will not be content to sing along. If I'm the one that's making you so out of touch. Then why don't you just go ahead and. Why don't you just go ahead and</segment1>
		<segment2>Blame it on this southern weather. Blame it on anything. It's not like you to ask small favors. You can blame me for everything</segment2>
		<segment3>If I'm the cause of all your sickness and pain. Then I'll bury my face in all of the dirty shame. If this is just what's getting you so out of touch. Then why don't you just go ahead and. Why don't you just go ahead and</segment3>
		<segment4>Blame it on this southern weather. Blame it on anything. It's not like you to ask small favors. You can blame me for everything</segment4>
		<segment5>This is my last plan to bury all of your charms. This is my final rush to reach for you     </segment5>
