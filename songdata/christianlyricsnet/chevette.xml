		<segment1>Twenty years ago I watched in awe. as my dad drove up the driveway. More than proud to have a brand. new family car. Thirty miles to the gallon, 0 to 60, sometimes. I remember putting down the back. seat and lying in the hatchback. Looking at the sky watching. trees go by. I was the son of a preacher, and. he was a rich poor man.</segment1>
		<segment2>No A.C. No FM, And no regrets, in my Chevette.</segment2>
		<segment3>The winter cracked the highway and. we tried to dodge the potholes. He never promised us it would be a. gentle ride. He never had a problem though, keeping it on the narrow road.    </segment3>
