		<segment2>oh no here we go again. I was rolling in when he was going in. he was like Oh no man I know youre him. let me go to the door and get my older friend. held it in with a grin is what I went and did. when he came back fast w/ another kid. I had to laugh when he asked as I shook my head. aint you the dude from rob and big. hold it kid man I think youre blind. you got me confused w/ another guy. I went and looked at the dude when I said I rhymed. and he was like yo Kevin federline! Whats up?. ya need to check ya eyes. step back get the fact then youll recognize. cause Im back to attack what you expect to find. its the new and improved kj supersized</segment2>

I was mad couldnt attract the ladies. these girls about to break me. you wanna know how theyd play me?. I was hoping for Patrick Swayze. but instead I got Kevin spacey. oh baby whoop dee whoo. nowadays when I straight come through. all I hear is how old are you. all my friends say 42. 42 are you crazy mad. ya crazy rude wheres ya brain just at?. Im 34 in case ya asked. youre old enough to be my dad</segment3>
		<segment4>. whos the man a w/ a grasp of grammar. who writes songs on a pack of pampers. the only rapper loved by yo grandma. haircut like adam sandler. no matter how you gone see me. what I wrote is the hope that you see he. whether cd live or 3d. just Jesus put him on a repeat. dont believe me I keep rehashing. this junk just keeps on happening. you can just keep keep on bashing. while the world just keeps on laughing. but Im a just keep on rapping. till the hammer pants back in fashion. while the crowd just keeps on packing. its just Jesus the focused passion</segment4>
