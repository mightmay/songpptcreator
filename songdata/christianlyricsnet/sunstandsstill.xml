		<segment1>Track Number: 11</segment1>
		<segment2>. I have been so worn and so spent. Medicate whats left and leave the rest. Fight to love and live I must confess. Medicate whats left forget the rest. Stranger things have touched and graced the ancient eyes. And it comes as no, comes as no surprise</segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS]: And I found it hard to believe. But I know that You will. Yeah I know Your will. Because the sun stands still. The sun stands still</segment3>
		<segment4>Bathe in beams of love and jealousy. To breathe the light of heaves kiss. A million beams will wait just for me, just for me. You hold the day with bloodstained wrists</segment4>
		<segment5>[CHORUS]</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh Jesus, Youre the one who puts the hallelujahs on my lips. Youre the holder of the sun, sweet salvation yes yes. Jesus youre the one</segment6>
		<segment7>So when I stand on Gibeon. And when the night has come. Im not alone, I see the light. Of the one, of the one I love</segment7>
		<segment8>[CHORUS]</segment8>
		<segment9>Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Jesus youre the one. The holder of the sun      </segment9>
