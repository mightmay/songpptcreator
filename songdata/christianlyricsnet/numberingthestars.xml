		<segment1>It's like numbering the stars, counting the same ones over and over again. Stop trying so hard, pressing to just get the feeling that he's there.</segment1>
		<segment2>Shut those eyes, open your arms wide, Then let him be the one to find you. Don't speak a word, he's already right in front of you.</segment2>
		<segment3>Stop perfecting every move like you did something wrong. Then maybe you'll hear the trees breathe where. He's calling out to you to come and walk with him. Against the wind, swim together in the waves</segment3>
		<segment4>His presence will bring you back to life. Just let him be there. No need to prove his existence. You know these blue skies were colored for you.     </segment4>
