		<segment1>I don't belong here. I never saw this on the path I walk. The blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floor. It's getting so hard. I never saw the backlash when the tide began to rise. I can't remember. The way it was when everything felt right. My mouth held shut and eyes sealed tight with control </segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-chorus]. So I remember on the inside </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. I found a dark, infernal place I don't want to face anymore. Somehow, I won't stop feeding the pain. My heart's just the same as before </segment3>
		<segment4>So now I'm stuck here. Between the guilty and the insincere. The words I spoke have left here all alone. I should have known this. I could've burned it when I had that choice. And now I'd die to kill this noise in my head </segment4>
		<segment5>[Pre-chorus] </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>So I remember on the inside </segment7>
		<segment8>If this is all the love my spirit can give. Just take it back tonight. There is not a reason more to live </segment8>
		<segment9>. .     </segment9>
