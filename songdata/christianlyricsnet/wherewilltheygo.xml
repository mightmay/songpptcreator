		<segment1>How many times did I not stand up for you?. Face to face with someone I hardly knew?. Where did they go from there?</segment1>
		<segment2>Lost in the world. And we may never meet again. God, will you send another light to lead them in?. Where will they go from there?</segment2>
		<segment3>Love, show me the way. When I'm afraid to say the right thing. I'm a stone, Frozed in place. I need your grace to show me how to love</segment3>
		<segment4>How many lives could be changed. If I'd convey all of the words that I was scared to say. Show me the way from here</segment4>
		<segment5>Love, show me the way. When I'm afraid to say the right thing. I don't know where they will go. As long as I know I have shown Your love</segment5>
		<segment6>I am lost without Your love    </segment6>
