		<segment1>Your worth is so much more than words. I know the sound of it's absurd. They'll say it's easier to wallow in distress. It might be true but then we'd. Look like all of them</segment1>
		<segment2>I know you look for clever words. But simple truth's what you deserve. I have a lifetime of this evidence in me. But you don't need a story. You need broken legs</segment2>
		<segment3>Call. On Me. We'll rise upon our knees. Call. On me. Cause I'm not that far away. Call. On me. We're slaves to liberty. Call. On Me. Cause I'm not that far. I'm not that far away</segment3>
		<segment4>Let go the contraband, my friend. We cannot gravitate to destination death. I see your legs are broken bones. Maybe instead of running, just crawl right back to home.     </segment4>
