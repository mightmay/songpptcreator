		<segment1>You've tried so hard, gone too far. To cover up who you are. Done your best, but no success. Cause deep inside it's still a mess. You've held so tight, but don't you know. Healing comes when you let go</segment1>
		<segment2>Open up the heart that you hide. Everything you locked up inside. It's time to come clean. Let mercy set you free. Take off that heavy disguise. Lay it all out in the light. The good, the bad, the in between. God loves what's underneath</segment2>
		<segment3>You're not alone, cause Jesus knows. The secrets that you're scared to show. And you can run, but when you're done. You'll see that you can't outrun love. Break the chains, find new hope. Freedom comes when you let go</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>The smile you try to fake. To cover up the pain. He holds all your mistakes. And then he washes them away. He washes them away    </segment5>
