		<segment1>The apartment is empty. The pictures have left their marks on the wall. Nothing has ever taken so long. Moving away a new horizon to look at each day and I'll try not to hold on. You practice your packing, the trailer is crammed with memories dear. Only the highway bears your pain. Count your blessings let the future now outweigh the past. And why would you look back?. Live life perfect. I admire the strength that you both have. I pray for you. Timing, everything, all that you have everyone loves you. And we too. Memories trail behind start out new and find the people who waited for you. Timing, everything, all that you have everyone loves you. And we too. Live life perfect. I admire the strength that you both have. I pray for you. Trailer full of victories and tragedies, new memories. Live life perfect. I admire the strength that you both have. I pray for you. Timing, everything all that you have everyone loves you. And we too..    </segment1>
