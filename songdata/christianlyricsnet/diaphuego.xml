		<segment1>I was bounded up. My mouth was shut. My hands in chains. In my life sin reigned. I did not move unless it told me to. I did not walk unless it allowed. I did not talk I did not scream. But not now because the truth is up. You deserve all the glory and praise. God, I praise you. I would rather die for you(Jesus) Than to be with you(satan). I would rather die for you anyway. Holy Spirit come take me away. I will never go and I will never leave you. Every step that I take I will be with you. Forever God I praise you    </segment1>
