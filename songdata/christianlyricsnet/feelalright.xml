		<segment1>Chorus: (Sun is shining). The sun is shinin', There's no need to sleep no more. (Day is bright, Yeah). The day is bright, And you're heart has its wings to soar. (It's a new day). Time will be flyin', Freedom is at the door, (Feel Alright, Yeah). You feel alright, Yeah, So what are You waitin' for?</segment1>
		<segment2>Celebrety and superstition, Whatever it takes to get some recognition. Selling antiques like they are new ideas, Makin' You pay for the thoughts they steal.</segment2>
		<segment3>Call me foolish, Call me crazy. But all this drama doesn't faze me. Tell me not to run, And I will run much faster. Tell me to be quiet, And I'll shout it from a mountain.</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>It doesn't take a mathmetition, To calculate our rising addiction. To romance, youth, and perfected beauty. Packaged, preserved for the mass appeal. You're not the first to buy their lies, They're not the first to waist you're time. Tell me to give up, And I will fight much harder, Tell me to be quiet, And I'll shout it even louder.</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>It's a new day, Different than yesterday. All the concepts fighting for a place in my mind. Well you'll find it's occupied with the divine.</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus)    </segment8>
