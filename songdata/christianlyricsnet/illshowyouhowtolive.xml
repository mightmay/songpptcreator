		<segment1>I heard the sound of your first breath. A brand new life on your mothers chest. A beating heart, expectant eyes. On the first day of your life. I saw you take your first step. And I watched you run with no regret. To chase your dreams and find true love. And the best is yet to come</segment1>
		<segment2>So come with Me. Ill show you life. Even better than this. Come with Me. Ill show you love. You didnt know could exist. Better than your first crush. Better than your first kiss. Ill show you how to live</segment2>
		<segment3>Remember how you felt from across the room. When you realized someone had eyes for you. And the way your heart sang cuz you believed. You were worth something</segment3>
		<segment4>So come with me. Ill show you life. Even better than this. Come with me. Ill show you love. You didnt know could exist. Better than your first crush. Better than your first kiss. Ill show you how to live. Oh, Ill show you how to live</segment4>
		<segment5>Cuz I created your heart. That makes you feel. I am the love that makes it real. Oh, I am the One, Im the One, Im the One. I am the One, Im the One, Im the One</segment5>
		<segment6>So come with Me. Ill show you life. Even better than this. Come with Me. Ill show you love. You didnt know could exist. Better than your first crush. Better than your first kiss. Ill show you how to live</segment6>
		<segment7>Cause I am the One, Im the One, Im the One. I am the one, Im the One, Im the One    </segment7>
