		<segment1>Hold close now. It's your only assurance. Of controlling the outcome of this ending. Is it ending or just leaving us. Tired and waiting?. You're chasing the reasons. Revolving in circles of questions. We've all tried to answer for ourselves. The answer's already inside us. Just Listen. And maybe you'll find an answer. You don't want to hear. It's only your diversions that keep it away. Just open up your eyes to see. Finally you'll understand to fill this void. Empty out entirely what's standing now    </segment1>
