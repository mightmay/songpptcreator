		<segment1>In the silence of Your majesty. In the splendor of Your holiness. In the stillness of Your glory. Let me hear Your voice. The gentle whisper of Your voice</segment1>
		<segment2>Father, I long to stand before You. And lay my life before You. I come to worship You alone,oh my God. I reach my hands toward You. With all my heart adore You. Let me hear Your voice</segment2>
		<segment3>With the power of Your presence. And Your beauty all around me. As the heavens stand in awe of You. Let me hear Your voice. The gentle whisper of Your voice    </segment3>
