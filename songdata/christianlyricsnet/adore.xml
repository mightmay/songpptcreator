		<segment1>From the moment you opened my eyes. I have seen the world in a different light. From the dawn to the setting sun. I am overwhelmed. By all that you have done</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Adore, adore, adore. Jesus I adore you, Yes I adore, Adore, adore, adore. Jesus, I adore you. And I lay my life before you, o lord</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a union of two becoming one. Deep inside my heart. I know that I belong. You have given everything to me. The least that I can do. Is give it back to you</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: And all I am and ever will be. Is for you, lord. And everything within me cries</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: Adore, adore, adore. Jesus, I adore you, Yes I adore you. And I lay my life before you. Adore, adore, adore, adore, adore. Jesus, I adore you</segment5>
		<segment6>And I lay my life before you. I long to love and adore you. I lay my life before you, o lord. I adore you    </segment6>
