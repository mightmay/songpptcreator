		<segment1>She's a skin art junkie, all cute and petite. all her fat-cat schemes don't look around. don't you even blame me. it's a real bad thing to spill your shades for a blind man to find it. who can feel the whole earth move and don't even mind it</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: I wanna know you. better than i do. relieve from myself, bring me into you. i wanna know you. better than i do. relieve me from myself, bring me into you</segment2>
		<segment3>she's a wanna be hero. yeah, she try to be strong. but at the end of the hour. you find that the tower ain't standing so tall. it's a real hard thing. to show your weakness. if anyone can love you, i know my King does</segment3>
		<segment4>-Chorus-</segment4>
		<segment5>Your Holiness. Your Kingdom. Your Righteousness. My Freedom</segment5>
		<segment6>she's an easy scare. she's a simple bluff. she's a timid girl. she's in love</segment6>
		<segment7>-Chorus-</segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
