		<segment1>We're all standing with our backs against the wall, Sooner or later. Waiting on a phone that never calls, at all. Heartbreak comes Rollin in like a storm, Sooner or later. Trying to swim but your sinking like a stone, Alone</segment1>
		<segment2>and I can feel fire in the night. Waiting here. Baby its like we're. Walking on a wire thru the fear. Take my hand. We'll get there</segment2>
		<segment3>Sooner or later I swear we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it, Sooner or later I swear we're gonna make it, we're gonna make it. Milk and honey till we get our fill. I'll keep chasing it I always will. Sooner or later I swear. We'll make it there. Sooner than later</segment3>
		<segment4>We're all waiting on dream thats hard to own, Sooner or later. trying to feel the high without the low, you know</segment4>
		<segment5>you can feel fire in the night. lying here. Baby its like we're. Walking on a wire thru the fear. Take my hand. We'll get there</segment5>
		<segment6>the fear inside. the hills we've climbed. the tears this side of heaven. all these dreams inside of me. i swear were gonna get there    </segment6>
