		<segment1>Religious fanatic, that's what they say. True, I may be on the brink. I hear them yell at us, shut up and play!. Well, who asked what you think?. No time for mediocricy, convenience, or practicality</segment1>
		<segment2>He went all out for us, say what you will. I'll answer to my God. I'm a freak, they say I've lost my mind. But I know I've never seen so clearly. When I speak, they say I've gone too far this time. Which lets me know, I have not gone nearly.</segment2>
		<segment3>Bible thumpin' reactionist. And I'm proud to bear the name. Take our music, take away our lives. Jesus still remains. I wonder what will people think. When why hear that I'm a Jesus Freak</segment3>
		<segment4>He went all out for us, say what you will. I'll answer to my God. I'm a freak, they say I've lost my mind. But I know I've never seen so clearly. When I speak, they say I've gone too far this time. Which lets me know, I have not gone nearly.</segment4>
