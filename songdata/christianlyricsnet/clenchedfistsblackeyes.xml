		<segment1>You say you're scared, we're not to blame. 'Cos mindless violence ain't our claim, A new breed's here, we're gonna stay, And tear down all your shallow ways. [Chorus]. 'Cos we are the new kids, We've got our heads, We'll keep on fighting, 'Til old ways are dead. Clenched fists, black eyes! [2x]. We're aiming for a different goal, Succeeding where the hippies failed. But one thing's sure and you can bet, We'll be more than a drugged-out threat!. [Repeat Chorus]    </segment1>
