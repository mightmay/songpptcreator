		<segment1>Healer heal me. Savior save me. Maker change me. Lover love me. Cuz I'm so tired of living for. The kind of love. That only lasts for a while. The pain, the shame. Tear me up inside</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: So I fall on my knees. To get back on my feet again. And I cry out for You. Would You please speak to me</segment2>
		<segment3>Healer heal me. Savior save me. Maker change me. Lover love me. Cuz I'm so tired of living for. The kind of love. That only comes and goes. But Your love. Your love lasts forever</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: So I fall on my knees. To get back on my feet again. And I cry out for You. To hear you speak to me. Yes I fall on my knees. To get back on my feet again. And I run hard for You. To enter Your rest.     </segment4>
