		<segment1>We all grew up in the church, knew the stories, knew the right things to say and how to say them. However, that has never been enough, and after walking away from God for a time; He still takes us back. Inspired by an events that renewed our realization that the more we disappoint, the more He seems to love.</segment1>
		<segment2>I've heard it said a million times. That I should hold on tight to Jesus. But I took this road so far from home. And distance came between us</segment2>
		<segment3>When I walked away, I knew one day. I'd need Your grace</segment3>
		<segment4>So now You'll find me on my knees. Surrendering. Â‘Cause I know that I'm really not so strong. And now, I'm done fighting for control. Oh, You can have this life. That I've been holding for so long. I'm learning to fall. Let my world crumble</segment4>
		<segment5>You ran so fast to rescue me. While I was barely breathing. You picked me up, You touched my face. And I began to see more clearly</segment5>
		<segment6>Though I'm such a disgrace, You still forgave. Your love remains</segment6>
		<segment7>Take me as an offering. I surrender everything. No more living without You    </segment7>
