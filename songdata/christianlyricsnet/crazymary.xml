		<segment1>Crazy Mary is a slow girl who looks up to no one. Would do anything for a cold one. Wishes she could find her way home. Got the look on her face and the stare of a ray gun. We walked by everyday. and I wish there was something I could do for her. </segment1>
		<segment2>Maybe if I took a little time to talk then she'd heal a little if she wants to. She can run but let's teach her how to walk away now. I'll shake a little if she wants to she'll laugh a little if she needs to. There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind. </segment2>
		<segment3>She watches the world pass her by like a freight train. They all call her the same name. Laughin' as they point and stare at her. So she crys out to God up in Heaven, been prayin since she was 11. For Him to send someone to meet her there. </segment3>
		<segment4>Maybe if I took a little time to talk then she'd heal a little if she wants to. She can run but let's teach her how to walk away now. I'll shake a little if she wants to she'll laugh a little if she needs to. There's a key to the door that she's hiding behind. </segment4>
		<segment5>And no one knows the thoughts, the dreams, and the ideas she's got and contains inside. She's broken apart and her heart is still lookin for somewhere to feel alright.
