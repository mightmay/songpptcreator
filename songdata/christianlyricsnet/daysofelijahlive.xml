		<segment1>These are the days of Elijah. Declaring the Word of the Lord, yes. And these are the days of his servant, Moses. Righteousness being restored. And these are the days of great trial. Of famine and darkness and sword. So we are the voice in the desert crying. Prepare ye the way of the Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Behold he comes. Riding on a cloud. Shining like the sun. At the trumpet's call. Lift your voice. It's the year of jubilee. And out of Zion's hill salvation comes</segment2>
		<segment3>And these are the days of Ezekiel. With dry bones becoming as flesh. And these are the days of his servant, David. Building the temple of praise, yes. And these are the days of the harvest. The fields are all white in the world. And we are the laborers that are in your vineyard. declaring the word of the Lord </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS 2X. Behold he comes. Riding on a cloud. Shining like the sun. At the trumpet's call. Lift your voice. It's the year of jubilee. And out of Zion's hill salvation comes</segment4>
		<segment5>There's no God like Jehovah (x8--modulate). There's no God like Jehovah (x8--modulate). There's no God like Jehovah (x7)</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS X2.     </segment6>
