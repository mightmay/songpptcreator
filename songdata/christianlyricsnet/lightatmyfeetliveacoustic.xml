		<segment1>As I aimlessly wander around how could I ever expect to be found. Until looking down and seeing the light at the ground by my feet. I heard angels resound and there I avowed this is the road I would take. Just to make it there for my sake now I say that I'll never break</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I can get there by the light at my feet. You've made me walk in electricity. I can get there by the light at my feet. You are my everything all that I need</segment2>
		<segment3>Now that I see it's so easy for me to proceed on the my destiny. And let it be seen the light that you've given thee. Let it be efficiently electricity. You can take me there    </segment3>
