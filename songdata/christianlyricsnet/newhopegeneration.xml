		<segment1>I've been there before, It's all I've ever known. Looking for the face I am. Where do I go? All that's in my sight. Are darkened dreams of empty lies. Hole is there it's waiting it is real. You are only what you want to feel. I can see your eyes and they are asking</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). We're a new hope generation. We can see the wasted lives in your faces. But we can see Messiah rise in these places. until the tears are gone</segment2>
		<segment3>I've seen you before, you're always on your face. Trying to gfind the traces left. Hungry and tire, waiting for your need. Just hold him close he won't ever let you go</segment3>
		<segment4>Open arms let your spirit pour</segment4>
		<segment5>Here's the call to anybody at all who's ever had. The rise right after a fall. It's revolutional when we come like this. They can't believe we're living represenatives. It gives light unto the Gen. X and Y, resolution. With no generic reply. I stand aside a genre that's on a tear. Broken chains explain that we almost there. You think I will throw away. But I don't care what you say. Cause the one you push aside, will rule one day. you can not divide a unified youth nation. So where's my anointed now generation    </segment5>
