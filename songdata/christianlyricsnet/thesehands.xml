		<segment1>The sun and moon and every star. Are there to show me who You are. I can be sure your fingerprints. Are everywhere</segment1>
		<segment2>My every move, my every breath. Were meant to point to your greatness. There's nothing made that was not made. To show Your power</segment2>
		<segment3>These hands were made to praise You. These lips were made to lift You up. I give to You my life in worship. These feet were made to serve You. This tongue, to sing of Your great love. I give to You my life in worship</segment3>
		<segment4>A tender thought, a caring deed. A gift of love to one in need. Bringing honest acts of worship to You, Lord</segment4>
		<segment5>Lifting holy hands in worship to You, Lord. God, receive this humble sacrifice of praise    </segment5>
