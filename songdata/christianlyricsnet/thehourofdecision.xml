		<segment1>What we once were can never be taken away from us. Let's raise our fists in the air, let's make a difference, go back to when we had something to say, let's make them listen again, let's make them. Understand, that we still have something to say. Let's start a revolution, let's start a fire, burn down these walls of hatred, burn down these walls of lies. Get back to when what we used to be. What we can be, can never be taken away from us. Let's raise our fists in the air, let's make a difference, let's start a revolution, lets start a fire, get back to when we still had something to say. March forward make them understand. We still have something to say, we must make them understand, we still have something to say. It's up to everyone, it's up to you and I, we still have something to say.     </segment1>
