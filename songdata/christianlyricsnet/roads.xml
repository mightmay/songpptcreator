		<segment1>Last night. Stopping by. Greeting me with an embracing bad breath. Five A.M. You woke me out of a restless R.E.M. I think it's time. To sober up and die</segment1>
		<segment2>Every little second is precious time. And every word seems to rhyme. I follow every word like streetlight. To make it home all right. Every little second flies. I hold on to them like pieces of paradise. I follow every word like streetlights. I want to fall in love and leave tonight</segment2>
		<segment3>Been riding in the sunset. Ignoring what follows after beauty. Fades to black. Just riding in the sunset. Now this paralyzing cold. Always come crawling back. I think it's time. To sober up and live</segment3>
		<segment4>Every little second is precious time. And every word seems to rhyme. I follow every word like streetlight. To make it home all right. Every little second flies. I hold on to them like pieces of paradise. I follow every word like streetlights. I want to fall in love and leave tonight    </segment4>
