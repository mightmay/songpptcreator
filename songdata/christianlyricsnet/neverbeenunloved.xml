		<segment1>I have been unfaithful. I have been unworthy. I have been unrighteous. And I have been unmerciful</segment1>
		<segment2>I have been unreachable. I have been unteachable. I have been unwilling. And I have been undesirable</segment2>
		<segment3>And sometimes I have unwise. I've been undone by what I'm unsure of. But because of You. And all that You went through. I know that I have never been unloved</segment3>
		<segment4>I have been unbroken. I have been unmended. I have been uneasy. And I've been unapproachable</segment4>
		<segment5>I've been unemotional. I've been unexceptional. I've been undecided. And I have been unqualified</segment5>
		<segment6>Unaware. I have been unfair. I've been unfit for blessings from above. But even I can see. The sacrifice You made for me. To show that I have never been unloved</segment6>
		<segment7>It's because of You. And all that You went through. I know that I have never been unloved    </segment7>
