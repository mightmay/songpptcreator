		<segment1>She shut your eyes. Now you could say better luck next time. But I know you're about to die. How deep can you drill into a man's soul. Still say better luck next time. When the only thing to fill it with is a lie </segment1>
		<segment2>So say what you want. But drops of crystal clear water. Has been falling into your heart </segment2>
		<segment3>Now you're sick of lying. Tonight a star is shining. On a heart that's dying. The morning star is shining again. So you better wake up. You better rise up. The morning star is shining again </segment3>
		<segment4>How long has it been since you gave in. Did it just take all this time. For you to see you're not the Messiah. She shut your eyes. Or did you do it yourself with time. Did you on purpose walk astray. Did you choose to be a liar </segment4>
		<segment5>A star called your name. Will you use your voice to answer. Just one last time </segment5>
		<segment6>Now you're sick of lying down again..     </segment6>
