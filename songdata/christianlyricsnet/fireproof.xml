		<segment1>Here's a chance to show you how I feel. A chance for you to see it's real. To see just what I feel inside and who it is that's by my side. I will never change my mind. Try to torch me and you'll find. You can't turn me or deter me. No matter how you try. You can't burn me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>I know where I stand and what'll happen if you try it. I am FIREPROOF. I know my heart and I just can't deny it. I am FIREPROOF. I tried to tell you but you wouldn't be quiet. I am FIREPROOF. I'll never bow down and you won't buy it. I am FIREPROOF</segment3>
		<segment4>Now you know what I'm all about. There's no chance I'll ever doubt. The only one who can control me. I extol the Almighty. You want me to put it on the line. And give yield to you this time. See but I won't compromise and I realize. It's my time to rise</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>You'll never take me in the fire. You'll never take my own desire.     </segment6>
