		<segment1>Stealing time feelin I'm burnin the day. torn with everything that I've thrown away. Waiting for the sun I burn. through the gray with my song.</segment1>
		<segment2>Need You, I feed you</segment2>
		<segment3>It's time to forget about all the things. you've been thinking about Lately. Lately, it's been a roller coaster. a thousand reasons why. It's time to forget about all the lies. that are making your heart angry. Angry at all the ones who said. you would never ever fly</segment3>
		<segment4>Cut and Move feel the groove of the day. pushin through the pain till it goes away. Memories cutting like a razor blade. pushin though the pain till it fades away. I Bleed You</segment4>
		<segment5>It's time to forget about all the things. you've been thinking about Lately. Lately, it's been a roller coaster. a thousand reasons why. It's time to forget about all the lies. that are making your heart angry. Angry at all the ones who said. you would never ever fly</segment5>
		<segment6>Wings take this heart of mine for a ride, through the sky. Wings take this heart for a ride through the sky     </segment6>
