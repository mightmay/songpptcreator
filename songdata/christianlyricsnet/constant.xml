		<segment1>I'm just a little bit afraid of where I'm going. And it feels like a hurricane is blowing over. Though I can't find the ground below. I've lived enough to know. I've lived enough to know. You're my constant in every moment. Constant. You've never failed me. All my life. You have never left my side. You are my constant. Okay I really don't like change but I can't stop it. I'm moving forward with the promise. You are the anchor for my soul. That's all I need to know. That's all I need to know. Before I was a thought on earth. You knew me then and You gave me worth. When all of this is said and done. You will be the One I'm standing on    </segment1>
