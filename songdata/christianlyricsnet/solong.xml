		<segment1>So long, farewell. Goodbye you crazy Southerner, goodbye. Dont cry, turn away. Dont change, Ill write. And all the other stuff we kinda mean. Dont cry, turn away</segment1>
		<segment2>Ill remember you, so long. With your super-thumping radio. Ill remember you, so long. Hey-oh</segment2>
		<segment3>Its been too long. Since games and running totals filled our minds. Boxed up, put away. Hach and Brian have gone now. You went your way, I went mine. Its all ok</segment3>
		<segment4>Ill remember you, so long. With your super-thumping radio. Ill remember you, so long. Hey-oh. Dont sit in that gum. As youre lounging in the sun. Ill remember you, so long. Hey-oh</segment4>
		<segment5>So long, farewell. Au revoir, goodbye. I hate to see you go. Dont cry, turn away</segment5>
		<segment6>Goodbye, my friend, Ill miss you so. Across the states you had to go. Goodbye, my friend, Ill miss you so. For all the way across the states you had to go</segment6>
		<segment7>Goodbye    </segment7>
