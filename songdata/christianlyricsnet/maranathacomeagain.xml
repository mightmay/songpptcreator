		<segment1>come let us go to the house of the Lord. the Kingdom of God and the city of man. a place for all races a place where Your grace is. dwell in our hearts in the works of our hands. come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands</segment1>
		<segment2>and now we see eyes in the mirror. reflections of You of what is to come. a glorious cloud a beauty profound. in the widow, the orphan, the lame and the poor</segment2>
		<segment3>come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands. come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>we are a broken world oh Lord. made worthy for the call to love. we're healed by grace through faith in You. a people truly set apart. we are a broken world oh Lord. unworthy to be set apart. we die unto our selfish ways. and go unto Your sacred heart</segment4>
		<segment5>come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands. come again feed Your lambs we are Your hands    </segment5>
