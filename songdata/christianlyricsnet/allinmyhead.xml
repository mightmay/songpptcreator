		<segment1>Fall, fall my eyes onto the page. Filling my mind with endless knowledge but in vain. Puff, puff my mind blows up and I. am left with everything that nothing is inside. Oh Lord I thought I knew it all. My heart was not informed I know nothing at all</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. I fall apart, when it's all in my head. Thought knowledge would save me left a void instead. Move into my heart bring to life what was dead. I can't feel Your heartbeat when You're in my head.</segment2>
		<segment3>If my mind is full but my heart isn't there. That's like trying to inhale without the air. So dear Jesus breathe new life in me. Resuscitate this heart of mine give it a beat. Oh Lord I thought I knew it all. My heart was not informed I know nothing at all</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>What if Salvation had been. Something He only thought about. What if He never let it sink into His heart. He could have simply spoken. Wise words erasing human doubts. But now I have a pulse He spoke them with His heart</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
