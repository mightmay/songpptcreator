		<segment1>Waves crashing over. Think I'm going under. Will the Savior keep me above the surface?</segment1>
		<segment2>Someone in the distance. Please call me from this. Only You can keep me above the surface</segment2>
		<segment3>Thinking that it all just might fade away. I'm terrified to fall 'cause I stepped out today. Sinking 'cause I know, I know I think too much. Save me, please save me</segment3>
		<segment4>My eyes are keeping. Focused only on You. It's You that keeps me above the surface. I just can't stop..</segment4>
		<segment5>Thinking that it all just might fade away. I'm terrified to fall 'cause I stepped out today. Sinking 'cause I know, I know I think too much. Save me, please save me</segment5>
		<segment6>The stronger the wind blows. The lesser my faith knows. And under the water. I'm colder, I'm farther. I wish I could keep it together. I don't want to let You down</segment6>
		<segment7>Thinking that it all just might fade away. I'm terrified to fall 'cause I stepped out today. Sinking 'cause I know, I know I think too much. Save me, please save me    </segment7>
