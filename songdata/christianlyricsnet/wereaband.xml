		<segment1>Freak!. is what the world calls me. They don't understand. so they try to stop me. Hide!. I can't hide. so I stand up straight with Christ by my side. No no no no need to be tounge tied. so I say it loud and I say it with pride. Died. he died. Christ gave it all but He's coming back to life. Now I've got a reason to saying the things I say. and you know I've got a reason to be doing the things I do. Because soon very soon. God's coming back and I want to be playing His tune. So, here we go </segment1>
		<segment2>We're a band. We're a band. With guitars in our hands. we're crossing the land. We're a band. We're a band. For the Son of man. we will take a stand. You can make a plan. He'll be back again. We're a band. We're a band. We're a band. We're a band </segment2>
		<segment3>Hey!. Please remove your hand from my mouth. it's been long enough so please do it now. uuh uuh uuh uuh uuh uuh uuh. you know you can't censor me. When wall flowers start to bloom. four more voices fill the room. Say, you better get out of the way     </segment3>
