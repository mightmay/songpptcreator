		<segment1>Everybody is asking why I like to swim upstream. Missing out on all the fun so it seems. But I've always found this world writes checks it cannot cash. Selling us the lie that this is where it's at </segment1>
		<segment2>But I I'm on the outside. Earthly good with heaven on my mind. And I I'm just a passer by home's a place that I have yet to be </segment2>
		<segment3>Life's always felt like a long and endless dream. Where tests and trials bring you to the final wake up scene. Now I'm not saying I'll ever waste a day. I'm just gonna live like I was never meant to stay </segment3>
		<segment4>And I I'm on the outside. Earthly good with heaven on my mind. And I I'm just a passer by. Home's a place where I have yet to be </segment4>
		<segment5>One life will come to pass. And what I've done for you is all that lasts. And so I am here. But I'm a stranger here living in reverent fear </segment5>
		<segment6>But I I'm on the outside. Earthly good with heaven on my mind. And I I'm just a passer by. Home's a place that I have yet to be </segment6>
		<segment7>That I have yet to be. That I have yet to be, hmmm </segment7>
		<segment8>And I I'm on the outside ooh ooh. And I I'm on the outside ooh ooh. And I have life life on the outside yeah. And I have life life on the outside. And I I'm on the outside.     </segment8>
