		<segment1>I choose to trust You. Even through the fire. Even when my eyes can't see. I know You're right beside me. I will always praise You Lord. No matter what may come. You are always faithful to me</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. So I will dream. And I'll believe. That what You've promised. Soon I will see. Soon I will see</segment2>
		<segment3>It's just a matter of time. Till I see Your face. Till I dance in Your presence. And sing out Your praise. It's just a matter of time. Till I hear You say. Well done</segment3>
		<segment4>I surrender. To Your will. To Your way. To Your plan. All I have. And all I am. All I am</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>It's just a matter of time. Till I see Your face. Till I dance in Your presence. And sing out Your praise. It's just a matter of time. Till I hear You say. Well done</segment6>
