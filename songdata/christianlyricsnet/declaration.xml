		<segment1>This is my heart's condition. This world has ammunition. To tear me down. And steal my life away </segment1>
		<segment2>I know there's more than this. More than temptation's kiss. So lift me up. And give me strength to say </segment2>
		<segment3>I will live. I will live for You </segment3>
		<segment4>I've had the revelation. This is my declaration. More of you, oh God, and less of me </segment4>
		<segment5>Cause You are my new existence. I offer no resistance. I'm running to the One I know I need </segment5>
		<segment6>How could I walk away. How could I walk away. How could I walk away </segment6>
		<segment7>I'll never walk away from You    </segment7>
