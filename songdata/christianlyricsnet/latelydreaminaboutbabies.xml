		<segment1>Verse 1: I used to think I had it made. Every time we said goodnight. This little dating game we've played. Has always seemed to feel alright. </segment1>
		<segment2>I've had my privacy, And your heart on a string. And it'sn ever been my style. To ruin a good thing. </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Oh, but lately. I've been thinkin' 'bout a. Change of plans, Maybe get a couple wedding bands. And do something crazy, Maybe ge a piece of land and see. If we could start a little family tree. I don't know what's gotten into me, But I've been dreamin' 'bout babies. </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: I know it can be hard. These days to be a family man. I know that all the experts say, You need to live life while you can. I've heard psychology on what. Makes true love true. And I've read books on educated. Points of view. </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus 2: Oh, but lately. I've been listenin' more to Dr. Suess. Readin' up on Mother Goose, Seems she's quite a lady. I've been seein' lots of. Pinks and blues. And little bitty tennis shoes, Hearin' goodnight Daddy, I love you's, Yeah, I've been dreamin' 'bout babies. </segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge: I used to dream of fancy foreign cars, And black tie affairs, And how we'd live in separate. Condos, while we climbed. The golden stairs. </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus 3: Oh, but lately. I've been thinkin' that it. Makes more sense. To build a house with a picket fence. And forget the Mercedes, Get some puppy-dogs and. Trainin' wheels. And a fmily Oldsmobile. I can't believe just how. Good it feels. To be dreamin' 'bout babies, </segment7>
		<segment8>Can't believe just how good it feels.     </segment8>
