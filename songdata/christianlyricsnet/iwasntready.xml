		<segment1>Everyday's not like any other day. With all that I have here and you. Everyday's not like any day before. With all that you gave me gets me off the floor </segment1>
		<segment2>Oh my soul was dry. Oh could I feel you tonight. Oh my soul was dry </segment2>
		<segment3>Everyday you remind me of the time. When nothing else mattered just you and I. All my life has always been so black and white. All these colours, these colours they bleed to one </segment3>
		<segment4>Oh my soul was dry. Oh could i feel you tonight. Oh my soul was dry </segment4>
		<segment5>Maybe I'll begin again. Maybe I will live again. Maybe I'll begin again. Maybe we will sing again     </segment5>
