		<segment1>Arise, my love, my lovely one come, Winter is past and the rains are gone. The flowers appear, it's the season of song, My beautiful one, arise and come with me. Who is it that appears like the dawn?. As fair as the moon, as bright as the sun?. Show me your face, let me hear your voice. My beautiful one, arise and come with me. Set me like a seal on your heart, For love is unyielding as the grave. The flash of it is a jealous fire, No flood can quench, For love is as strong as death. Arise my love and come with me. Before the dawn breaks and the shadows flee. You ravished my heart with just one glance. My beautiful one, arise and come with me. Do not arose or awaken love. Until it so desires. Arise, my love, my lovely one come, The Winter is past and the rains are gone. The flowers appear, it's season of song, My beautiful one, arise and come with me. I am my love's, my beloved is mine. Arise and come with me.    </segment1>
