		<segment1>Everyday I go to school and study humans. I sit and watch them all go by. Everyday's a new day to study humans. I sit and ovserve this girl named bri with my eye. All those mannerisms and the funny things the do. Humans and their dogmas the defend so selfisly. I'm planning to take over cause I hate living on the moon. They won't get suspicious cause the soaps are on at noon</segment1>
