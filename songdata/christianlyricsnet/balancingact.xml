		<segment1>I've got to climb to the top. Never stop, until I reach it. Until I feel that I'm gold. And that I'm in control. Of life and my thought. When I'm not, I still preach it. Because they're all going to see. if I start to fall or lose control. I'm losing control..of this</segment1>
		<segment2>I've been balancing on suspended pianos. And trying to a decompose. It makes the loudest noise when they begin to crash. With eyes on me, I force a laugh. You come to me and set me free</segment2>
		<segment3>I Cross my heart and I cross my chest. This is not a gift I can accept. But I appreciate the sentiment. I've worked too hard for rightousness. To just lay down while you hand me this. And put my faith in something you call grace..from you.</segment3>
		<segment4>I've been lost inside a cave without a lantern. At every sound I start to run. I feel my way around the dark without a pattern. If I would wait you'd come. to rescue me and sail away</segment4>
		<segment5>Cross my heart and cross my chest. This is not a gift I can accept. But I appreciate the sentiment. I've worked too hard for rightousness. To just lay down while you hand me this. And put my faith in something you call grace..from you.</segment5>
		<segment6>[from you]. I've been trying to learn what is from you. Because I've been trying to learn what this feeling gets love</segment6>
		<segment7>Every sound that you. Try to just refuse. Does it give and take?. Keeps it in my face. And tell me that this blood. Was spilled in vain.     </segment7>
