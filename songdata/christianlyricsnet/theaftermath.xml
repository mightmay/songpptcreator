		<segment1>The aftermath was better than I thought it would be. But I closed my eyes so I couldn't see what would become of it. The stars, they burn bright in this evening sky. And there's not a thing standing in my way tonight. And I promise you that we will make it out alive, out alive. We're just a little bit closer now. The sea, it holds me close. Pushing against the hands that held us back. That held us back. Pushing against the hands that held us back. Should we run away or face the days we have before us?. Right through the barricades onto the shores below us. Day and night, our steps and paths are chosen for us. Let's bury the past, within the sand beneath us. And i promise you that you will never fall again, never fall again. Day and night you hold me close never letting go now    </segment1>
