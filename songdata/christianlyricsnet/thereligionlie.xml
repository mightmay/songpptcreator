		<segment1>Religion, has made a fool, has made a fool out of you. You think that you can be saved by the works and the things that you do. Led around so blindly by what the church tells you to do. Never thinking just accepting the unbiblical lies told to you. Confession to a man, won't save your sins. Your prophets put up high on church pedestals, won't save your sins. Go to church every Sunday, it won't save your sins. Say your hail marys all you want it wont save your sins. There's only one way to God, through Jesus Christ his son. Don' be fooled by this worlds lies. Religion isn't always what it seems.    </segment1>
