You were a song I couldn't sing . caught like a bear by the bees with its hand in the hive . who complains of the pain of the sting . when I'm lucky I got out alive! . a life at best left half behind, . the taste of the honey still sweet on my tongue . and I'd run (Lord knows I've tried) . but there's no place on Earth I can hide . from the wrong I've done </segment1>
		<segment2>then I saw a mountain and I saw a city . steadily sinking but suspiciously calm . it wasn't an end, it wasn't a beginning . but a ceaseless stumbling on . there, strapped like a watch on my wrist . that's finished with gold but can't tell the time . was all or what little pleasure exists . seductively sold and uselessly mine </segment2>
		<segment3>our horse was fast and first from the gate . with the lead of a length at the sound of the gun . and the last of our cash laid down to fate (at 17 to 1) . but by the final stretch in the rear of the pack . that nag limping bad in the back . we reluctantly gave all the money we'd saved . 1/5 to the commonwealth and the rest ot the track . then I saw a forest grow in the city . and a driftwood wall of birdhouse gourds . and I'm still waiting to meet a girl like my Mom . who's closer to my age . the true light of my eyes is a Pearl . equally emptied to equally shine . and all or what little joy in the world . seemed suddenly simple and endlessly mine </segment3>
		<segment4>I was once the wine and you were the wineglass, . I was once alive when you held me, . but G-d became the glass, . all things left are emptiness . but oh, you're just a little girl . if you look out and see a trace . of a dark red that was once my face . in the clarity of such grace, . you'll forget all about me.
