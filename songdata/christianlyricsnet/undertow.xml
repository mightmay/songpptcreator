		<segment1>(verse). Addicted to this habit. I pretend that I don't have it. Right now it's hurting more than ever before. I fall down I'm gonna hit the bottom floor. I can't do this anymore </segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). This isn't easy. Fighting these feelings. I try but i'm caught in the undertow. You are my rescue. I'm numb from my black and blue. I try but i'm caught in the undertow. Pull me up. Out of the undertow</segment2>
		<segment3>(verse). Break down what I can't let go. Shut out the fears that haunt. Times up, I can't hold my breath anymore. Speak now, Your words will bring me back to the shore    </segment3>
