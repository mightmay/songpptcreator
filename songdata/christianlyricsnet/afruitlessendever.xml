		<segment1>You cannot hide now. I'll find you somehow. Together we can find new ways to drown</segment1>
		<segment2>All I really want is. A moment of your time. To grant. To give. To make you one with mine. You'll fill this empty space and. I will. Be your outlet. We'll plant. We'll reap. And meet in cruel descent</segment2>
		<segment3>Together we can find new ways to drown</segment3>
		<segment4>You know. You're mine. This madness suits me fine. Your shadow is my comfort 'til the end of time</segment4>
		<segment5>All I really want is. Someone to share with me. This treasure. This gift. This unceasing agony. How could you ever turn back now when. Our failure's so complete. So cold. So far. So dark in here with me</segment5>
		<segment6>Together we can find new ways to drown</segment6>
		<segment7>You know. You're mine. This madness suits me fine. Your shadow is my comfort 'til the end of time. You know. You're mine. This madness suits me fine. Your sadness is my reason to forget what lies inside</segment7>
		<segment8>There must be something, something else. Yeah, something, something else. Yeah, something, something else. There must be something else than you</segment8>
		<segment9>You cannot hide now. I'll find you somehow. Together we can find new ways to drown</segment9>
		<segment10>You know. You're mine. This madness suits me fine. Your shadow is my comfort 'til the end of time (2x)</segment10>
		<segment11>You know. You're mine. This madness suits me fine. Your sadness is my reason to forget what lies inside    </segment11>
