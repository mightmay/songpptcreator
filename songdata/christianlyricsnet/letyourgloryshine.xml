		<segment1>Your love won't deny me. Even in the storm You find me. You call me from the darkness to Your light. Your hand ever leads me. Lord You're never gonna leave me. You're teaching me to fight a better fight</segment1>
		<segment2>Let Your glory shine. Let Your glory shine. Let Your glory shine through me</segment2>
		<segment3>I know You're the Savior. You're taking every fear and failure. You're lifting me to rise above it all. Your love won't be shaken. You're taking who I am and makin'. Something out of nothing for Your cause    </segment3>
