		<segment1>Distance makes my heart to fester. in self-inflicted pain. If I can't face the consequences of my actions. I'll find somebody else to blame</segment1>
		<segment2>I greet you with a brother's kiss. and crank the knife anothertwist</segment2>
		<segment3>Twisting facts to fit the fabrications of my mind. I find I've crossed the line. No matter what the cost I must be right</segment3>
		<segment4>I greet you with a brother's kiss. and crank the knife another twist. pointing to things that don't exist. I crank the knife another</segment4>
		<segment5>Alone among the ashes of the things. which once defined my life. I hold the match that lit the fire. but you'll never see me take the blame.     </segment5>
