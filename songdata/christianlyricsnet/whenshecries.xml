		<segment1>Little girl terrified. Shed leave her room if only bruises would heal. A home is no place to hide. Her heart is breaking from the pain that she feels</segment1>
		<segment2>Every days the same. She fights to find her way. She hurts, she breaks, she hides, and tries to pray. She wonders why, does anyone ever hear her when she cries</segment2>
		<segment3>Today shes turning sixteen. Everyone singing, but she cant seem to smile. They never get past arms length. How could they act like everything is alright?. Shes pulling down her long sleeves. To cover all the memories that scars leave. She says,  maybe making me bleed will be the answer that could wash the slate clean</segment3>
		<segment4>This is the dark before the dawn. The storm before the peace. Dont be afraid cause seasons change and. God is watching over you. He hears you    </segment4>
