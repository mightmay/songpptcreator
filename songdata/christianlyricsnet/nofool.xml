		<segment1>I've lost track of all the Sundays. The offering plate's gone by and as I gave my hard earned dollars I felt free to keep my life.</segment1>
		<segment2>I talk about commitment. And the need to count the cost, but the words of a martyr show me I dont know, his cross.</segment2>
		<segment3>For he is no fool, who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.</segment3>
		<segment4>Obedience and servanthood are traits I've rarely shown. the fellowship of his sufferings is a joy I've barely known. There are riches in surrendering, that can't be gained for free. and God will share all heavens wonders, but the price he asks is me.     </segment4>
