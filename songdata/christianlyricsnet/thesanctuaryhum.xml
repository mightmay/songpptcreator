		<segment1>Smile, wave. Convince the sanctuary, our charade. Though you're the object of my deepest rage. Just counterfeit this holiness for me. And everything will be OK</segment1>
		<segment2>My sweet one. You tell no lies. The greatest reason to be despised</segment2>
		<segment3>But we must pretend. Your broken wrist. Just happened when you fell off your bike</segment3>
		<segment4>So this is. The reason. The sanctuary hums. God save us. God save us. From your chosen ones</segment4>
		<segment5>Smile, wave. Protect his pulpit from all suffering. He'll make celebrity the end game. So much more valuable than family. Not even violence can betray..</segment5>
		<segment6>As long as. You keep your lips. Locked up til the end of this age</segment6>
		<segment7>And even. If you won't. It's your word up against what he'll say</segment7>
		<segment8>Cry, Girl. Become the wails of victims unheard. Your tears have given you the calm nerve. So if they're asking you to hide your bane. You just keep screaming to the grave</segment8>
		<segment9>You'll be. The reason. The helpless celebrate. He takes us. He takes us. From our violent shame    </segment9>
