		<segment1>Though I am weak. Sometimes weary. In times of trial. I hide my face. In the balance. Judge me wholly. Please don't judge me. By my shame </segment1>
		<segment2>In dark hours. Of confrontation. When words may fall. Too soon to unsay. Don't mistake them. For my true meaning. They are measures. Of my shame </segment2>
		<segment3>I have tried to. Live life humbly. Not a coward. Not in vain. When my meekness. Overcomes me. Remember me. Not my shame. Not my shame </segment3>
		<segment4>I am small. And self-conscious. Every mirror. Reflects the grain. Judge my essence. By my kinships. Remember me. Not my shame </segment4>
		<segment5>I am weak. Sometimes weary. Sometimes small. I hide away. When my hours. Are all accounted. Please don't bind me. To my shame </segment5>
		<segment6>I have tried to. Live life humbly. Not a coward. Not in vain. When my meekness. Overcomes me. Remember me. Not my shame. Not my shame. (repeat)    </segment6>
