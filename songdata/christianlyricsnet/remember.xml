		<segment1>Remember the time we raced along the coast?. To bad you can't hold it in your hand so tight. All to soon it slips away. Do you remember that day?. Could you ever know?. If only these words meant more. Could you ever see?. This past six years changing faces in our lives. If you could only see what you've meant to me. There at all the right times. My shoulder to cry on. Could you ever know?. If only these words meant more. Could you ever see?.     </segment1>
