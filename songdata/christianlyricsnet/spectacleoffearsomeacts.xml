		<segment1>Take hold your fate in your hands. Your payment, in time, will demand. With fruit thats forbidden, we eat then we die. and we cant survive</segment1>
		<segment2>When evil rears its head. its life and death. Like David sowed his seed. and his family bled</segment2>
		<segment3>Consequence comes likes a thief. So quick that it defies belief. Beware the curse it will pass to your seed. with dirty deeds</segment3>
		<segment4>You tried to tempt your fate. turns out its your mistake. you took what wasnt yours to take now. didnt you?. didnt you?</segment4>
		<segment5>You only have one chance. Dont take it light. You only have one chance. so get it right</segment5>
		<segment6>Dont take it light. So get it right    </segment6>
