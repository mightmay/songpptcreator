		<segment1>Every morning praise I sing to Thee. You're slow to wrath and. Swift to bless my soul. Your love endures unchanging. O hallelujah </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Cover me with Your grace. Shine on me with Your light. Take Your arms hold me tight. Keep me caught in the moment </segment2>
		<segment3>Every night I pray myself to sleep. I look to You and plead. My soul You'll keep. You endure unchanging. O hallelujah </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS </segment4>
		<segment5>You've opened my eyes now. The mystery is clear to me. That in You and You alone. I find the love that sets me free </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
