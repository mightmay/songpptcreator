		<segment1>Shallow capacity is bearing all I see, and I know. It's disease, it's loss, it's death knocking at my door. I click these thoughts to something else, something more.</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm so blue, you're so blue.</segment2>
		<segment3>Detached harmonies, all the airways scream dissonance. And we know of broken life, broken homes, Broken hearts and broken bones, Recycling the paper of a crying world's suicide note and. We're so blue, so blue.</segment3>
		<segment4>See the world spinning round. A sucking hole that souls go down. Embrace the sorrow of today because repentance finds a way. Only His blood can heal our wounds. Only His blood can heal our wounds. And if repentance finds a way, what's left today to be.blue?</segment4>
		<segment5>A final symphony, The precipice too close, you're scaring me -- back away. Sin is real, it doesn't feel, It always, only always, steals. Run to the cross the only joy that's real.    </segment5>
