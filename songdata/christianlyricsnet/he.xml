		<segment1>Heaven is a place.. Where mothers don't have to cry for their babies. Wonderin' if they'll live to see 16. Fighting in the street for some money. wonderin' if they'll ever make ends meet. Heaven is a place that everyone dreams. of, filled with kindness flowing with the real love. One day I'm gonna climb those golden stairs. But until I get there,</segment1>
		<segment2>(He) is working on me. (He) never leaves me. (He) lets me know that I am not alone in the darkness. (He) wants me to be happy. (He) smiles when I'm laughing. (He) makes me believe. Heaven's a place</segment2>
		<segment3>Here, in my soul if I listen. There, even when I think it isn't. Building everywhere that I go. Calling out so that I can follow. Love is a place and it's all around us. Like a circle, it's around us. Where I wanna be, until I learn to fly. Until I reach the sky</segment3>
