		<segment1>Sittin' in my room staring at the wall. Wonderin' about the meaning of it all. Why is it this thing called life. Has got me goin' crazy. So I open up your word and let it speak to me. The purpose and the plan that you've designed. Is clear to see, and I believe</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. I'm gonna live for today. I'm gonna follow in your way. I'm gonna let my little light shine. Like there's no tomorrow. I won't worry about the past. I know my future is intact. So I'll choose to live my life one way. I'm gonna live it for today</segment2>
		<segment3>You told me not to worry. About what lies ahead. So I am gonna focus on today instead. Making every moment count and counting. Every single blessing. I'm gonna set my mind on the. Here and the Now. This is what I want my life to be about. And this is How..</segment3>
