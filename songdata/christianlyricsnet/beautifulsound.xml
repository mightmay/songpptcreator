		<segment1>Turn the page. Can't turn the light out. Every word, every line. Carries to my soul. Dark letters on a page. Singing so loud. Where did I go wrong. Not to hear You?</segment1>
		<segment2>Eighteen years, I guess it was all right. I let You do the thinking, I'd just bide my time. Father to son. Sunday hand-me-down. Where did I go wrong. Not to hear Your song?</segment2>
		<segment3>It's a beautiful sound. Moving through the crowd. Voices lifted up. On high for You.</segment3>
		<segment4>It's a beautiful song. We've only just begun to understand. Rediscovering You.</segment4>
		<segment5>To have found You, and still be looking for You, It's &quot;the soul's paradox of love.&quot;. You fill my cup, I lift it up for more. I won't stop now that I'm free. I'll be chasing You. Like You chase me.</segment5>
		<segment6>It's a beautiful sound. Moving through the crowd. Voices lifted up. On high for You.</segment6>
		<segment7>It's a beautiful song. We've only just begun to understand. Rediscovering You.</segment7>
		<segment8>Oh, something so beautiful.</segment8>
		<segment9>It's a beautiful sound. Moving through the crowd. Voices lifted up. On high for You.</segment9>
		<segment10>It's a beautiful song. We've only just begun to understand. Rediscovering You.</segment10>
		<segment11>It's a beautiful sound. Moving through the crowd. Voices lifted up. On high for You.</segment11>
		<segment12>It's a beautiful song. We've only just begun to understand. Rediscovering You.</segment12>
		<segment13>It's a beautiful sound. Moving through the crowd. Voices lifted up. On high for You.</segment13>
		<segment14>It's a beautiful song. We've only just begun to understand. Rediscovering You.</segment14>
		<segment15>Something tells me it's all right. You know it's gonna be all right.    </segment15>
