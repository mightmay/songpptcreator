		<segment1>If money makes the world go round, feed them lies to put them in the ground. Tell them exactly what they want to hear, because they all have itching ears. You are the one that I despise, instead of love you spread your lies again, again, again, again. So go ahead and prophesy, and let the money satisfy. How can you live your life? Knowing, it's just a lie. Here I stand. I can do no other. Truth at all Cost. . Here I stand. I can do no other. Truth at all cost. . If money keeps you satisfied, feed them lies, as long as you get by. Hide behind the name of Christ, You are the one I despise. Instead of Christ, Instead of love you spread your lies again, again, again, again. . Here I stand. I can do no other. Truth at all cost. . Here I stand. I can do no other. Truth at all cost. . I will stand till my last breath. I will stand against the lies. . I will stand against the lies, against the pain that you've caused inside so many lives. You are the one I despise. Your words, they seem as though they're knives, sunk deep into their backs I can hear their cries. . I will defend the truth. . Truth at all cost. Your life's a lie.    </segment1>
