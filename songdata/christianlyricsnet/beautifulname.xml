		<segment1>Your heart I seek to find. With Your hands You fashioned mine. Let me be used to carry out the truth. To the ends of the earth. 'Til everyone's heard. My mended heart will share Your words. I will tell the world that You are God</segment1>
		<segment2>I will run. I will fly. I will live to be a sacrifice. Through it all I'll rise above. Unafraid I will face what comes. I will run. I will fly. And for my faith I will live &amp; die. I'll be strong - I will press on. For the sake of Your beautiful name. Your beautiful name</segment2>
		<segment3>Should all life cease to grow. Should chaos take control. The only hope we know is You will save us. It's worth the cost to take up my cross. As You take back what's been lost. Until all who doubt know. You are God</segment3>
		<segment4>I will run. I will fly. I will live to be a sacrifice. Through it all I'll rise above. Unafraid I will face what comes. I will run. I will fly. And for my faith I will live &amp; die. I'll be strong - I will press on. For the sake of Your beautiful name. Your beautiful name</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm not captive anymore. I'm gonna soar to a new placce. Take on a new pace. I know what my life is for</segment5>
		<segment6>I will run. I will fly. I will live to be a sacrifice. Through it all I'll rise above. Unafraid I will face what comes. I will run. I will fly. And for my faith I will live &amp; die. I'll be strong - I will press on. For the sake of Your beautiful name. Your beautiful name    </segment6>
