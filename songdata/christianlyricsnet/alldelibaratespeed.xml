		<segment1>You said you meet us in the middle of the afternoon. And we said we're frusterated. And you tried to take us. &quot;Go on, get ready, cause it's coming soon.&quot;. Well no thanks, we'll make it.</segment1>
		<segment2>So it brings us back to this. Something's got to give. So are you listening?. Or are you coming around again?</segment2>
		<segment3>All deliberate speed- Lately you've been comtemplating. Is this real or is this fading? What brought you here in the first place?. Everyone around us screams &quot;It's got to be and it's got to hit you.&quot;. Well, you and me, well we can change the world.</segment3>
		<segment4>We could drive and we could take our stuff on out of here. We'll leave with the sunrise. This place and this city it's good for nothing but feeling down. Let's say we'll break it.</segment4>
		<segment5>Losing sleep for days. Is this just a phase?. Are there other ways?. The one who sings is the one who pays.</segment5>
		<segment6>Sound off we're going to LA. You wanted to be the one who makes it happen so.. Sound off we're going to LA. If it's going to be then we've got to give. But it's got to be enough for me. </segment6>
		<segment7>. .     </segment7>
