		<segment1>Time has come. Time to confront what I have fought with so long. I have to fight, not conform to myself. Conform to this world, give into my sin, only to fall again. I won't be held down, cause with God I know. I'm strong and I know that I will overcome.</segment1>
		<segment2>You've brought me this far but each step I take. is getting harder, but with each step I take, I know I'm getting stronger.</segment2>
		<segment3>God help me to use this truth you've put inside. cause with your strength I will try.     </segment3>
