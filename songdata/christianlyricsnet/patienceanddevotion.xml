		<segment1>Sweet Patience, the product of our love. We can rise above together. Well make it though rain fills the sky. We can fly through any weather </segment1>
		<segment2>Take heart tonight. We were made for flight. But its faith that takes us there </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, emotions take us for a ride. Till all of our insides are screaming. This devotion is what we were made for. But now were wanting more than dreaming </segment3>
		<segment4>Take heart tonight. We were made for flight. But its faith that takes us there. We want more than dreaming. And we are screaming Love. But its faith that takes us there </segment4>
		<segment5>Weve held hostage our desires. And put the water to the fire for so long. Weve been so strong    </segment5>
