		<segment1>We lay face in pale solitude. To save face, we pulled our walls in front of you. To the same place where we danced in front of you. We fell from grace and watched the hope'fall from your face. This isn't me i used to say. All the love was so gone. It feels good to be alive. I've been dead for so long: and all the broken promises. I can't face. Afraidif someone notices, I lose my place. Fractured, broken, paralyzed. I need some space, tear me open, analyze. This isn't me i used to say. All the love was so gone. It feels good to be alive. I've been dead for so long. Wake up screaming, I'm awake and dreaming, And i won't stop breathing until my heart stops beating. This isn't me, i used to say. All the love was so gone, It feels good to be alive, I've been dead for so long.     </segment1>
