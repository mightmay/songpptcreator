		<segment1>I don't know if it ever meant a thing, All the times you explained yourself away, 'Cause I was so young, I was so innocent, I didn't know that the time, it wasn't spent, (too late). Now that time has gone too far away, (it's too late). No matter how much I long for another day, (too late). Maybe it's too late, maybe we can salvage what we though was dead, (too late). Don't tell me it's over.</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't owe you anything, Just say the word and I'll be a memory, I've always wanted to believe, But, time and time, you killed my everything, But there's still hope.</segment2>
		<segment3>I will never understand what you did to me, I remember all the promises made in vain, But you were so numb, so blinded by your self, You keep pretending that you never walked away.</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't owe you anything, Just say the word and I'll be a memory, I've always wanted to believe that there was something left in me, But everything I thought that we could be I let go of yesterday, And, with the hope of you and me, I will let it go today.</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't know if it ever meant a thing, 'Cause I was so young, I wanna know if it ever meant a thing, 'Cause I was so young.</segment5>
		<segment6>I don't owe you anything, Just say the word and I'll be a memory, I've always wanted to believe that there was something left in me, But everything I thought that we could be I let go of yesterday, And, with the hope of you and me, I will let it go today.    </segment6>
