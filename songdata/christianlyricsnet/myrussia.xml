		<segment1>the morning comes. I've not yet closed my eyes. cold and bright as I need it. the sun does rise</segment1>
		<segment2>these were my thoughts as I. passed neath your window. saw you through stained glass. with only one eye</segment2>
		<segment3>hide me in your hand. with the mother of my children. where the land sinks deep in it's color. bless the ground where we kneel. safe in your woven creel. we follow for you speak. you speak as no other</segment3>
		<segment4>no one asked any questions. for fear that I might answer. they covered their ears to your song</segment4>
		<segment5>have I shown them compassion. have I shown them any love. I hope they know it come. from the father above</segment5>
		<segment6>self righteous self pity. this I do not doubt. bind and turn the strong man out. for you know my frame. the sound of my new name. as I hold forth nothing worth saving</segment6>
		<segment7>for I am everything. I am everything. I am everything that he is not.     </segment7>
