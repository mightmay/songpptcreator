		<segment1>You're calling me to lay aside the worries of my day. To quiet down my busy mind and find a hiding place. Worthy, Worthy</segment1>
		<segment2>I open up my heart and let my spirit worship Yours. I open up my mouth and let a song of praise come forth. Worthy, You are worthy</segment2>
		<segment3>chorus. Of a child-like faith. And of my honest praise. And of my unashamed love. Of a holy life. And of my sacrifice. And of my unashamed love.     </segment3>
