		<segment1>Every time I fall down on my face. I see the one who bore all my shame. To know that you are everything I need you to be. You're my ever present help in time of need </segment1>
		<segment2>I know you understand it all. So why don't I get back on my feet again. Every pain I feel inside my heart. It takes a faith I know I can't depart </segment2>
		<segment3>To know that you hear every cry I raise to you. Bringing thoughts of hope the words I bring I know are few </segment3>
		<segment4>I know you understand it all. So why don't I get back on my feet again. You hear me when I call. You're there when I fall. You hear me when I call </segment4>
		<segment5>I know you understand it all. So why don't I get back on my feet again    </segment5>
