		<segment1>There you stood in disbelief, Trying all you could to se through these lies. And every word that I could breathe, Would you find more inclined to leave, but I tried. And knowing what I've done to you, With every thought you suffer through. My heart as black as evil can. And everything I could have been, Erased by what I wanted then. I couldn't think a lesser man </segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-chorus]. All the delicate ways. That I deepened our graves. My apology pales </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Oh, the pain in your eyes. My regrets have never known such sorrow. Oh, the shame that you hide. Resolutions are the same tomorrow </segment3>
		<segment4>So now I reap what I have sewn, and any rapture I had shown has bled dry. And I walked the streets alone, accepting pain I'd never known, as you died. Then I hurt myself to see it too, to feel the knife I put in you. My heart as broken as my ways. I never should've let it pass, this fall was never meant to last. The reason gone and damage stays </segment4>
		<segment5>. .     </segment5>
