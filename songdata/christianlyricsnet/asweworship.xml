		<segment1>Holy Spirit, We're calling on You. We are asking you to send the rain. When we worship in spirit and truth. something happens that we can't explain. Demons tremble; Kings bow down. Lives are changed at the sound of your name</segment1>
		<segment2>2X's. As we lift our voice in praise, let your glory fill this place. As we bring this offering, Jesus we crown you as Lord and King. As we worship. (repeat phrase after 2X's thru)..    </segment2>
