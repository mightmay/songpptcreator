		<segment1>9:20 in the valley of the sun. Contruction lights burn out on the 101. There's a restless feeling in the center of my soul. That won't let go now</segment1>
		<segment2>Once again I am feeling the pain. Of a hunger for the answer to the questions that remain. Like a thirst that knows no quenching, a longing for a home. I think I know now</segment2>
		<segment3>Everyday I get a little closer. Everyday I get a little closer</segment3>
		<segment4>What ever happened to the days of my youth. Trusting was easy when I could see the truth. Still believing your redemption but I'm looking for the proof. I'm not alone now</segment4>
		<segment5>Everyday I get a little closer. Everyday I get a little closer. Everyday I get a little closer. Everyday I get a little closer.     </segment5>
