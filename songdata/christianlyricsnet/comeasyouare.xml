		<segment1>Come as you are. Open hands, broken heart. As you are. Come with your joy. And your pain. With your doubt and your shame. As you are</segment1>
		<segment2>Prodigal daughters and sons, everyone. All will be forgiven. No matter what youve done. And when the Father sees you he will run. No matter how far. Come as you are</segment2>
		<segment3>Come, please dont wait. Theres still time. Its not too late. To come as you are    </segment3>
