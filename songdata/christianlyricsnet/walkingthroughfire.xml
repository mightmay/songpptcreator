		<segment1>Here I am! Yeah.. A dangerous man. Father God, give me strength to fight this to the end, then to jump in faith and to break every stronghold in my way. The time is up; the time has come, quit playing it safe. I spit in your face.</segment1>
		<segment2>The end is coming, but not yet. Youre not that lucky. Torment will go on and on. I was expecting you and Im not afraid of 10,000 of the ungodly.</segment2>
		<segment3>Nothing you do can stop me now! (Nothing you do can stop me now!) You wont take me!</segment3>
		<segment4>The hell you preach and ascend from has been shoved down our throats for far too long. In evil theres no spark of creativity; theres only twisted and deformed darkened beauty. I curse you back to your wasteland.</segment4>
		<segment5>Nothing you do can stop me now! (Nothing you do can stop me now!). Send us the sounds of heaven, send us the sounds of war. Send us the sounds of heaven, send us the sounds of war.</segment5>
		<segment6>Every ounce of evil will fade away.</segment6>
		<segment7>We are the sounds of heaven, we are the voice of war. We are the sounds of heaven, we are the voice of war. We are the sounds of heaven, we are the voice of war.    </segment7>
