		<segment1>It's always been You from the day that I saw You. From a heart that was broken I was changed into something brand new. Like a butterfly learning how to use my wings to fly like the wind. Gotta make it home again. It's always been You seeing deeper than the surface with a smile You demolish all my walls You can always break through to the heart of the matter no matter what I try to do. When I hide from the sun You come and change my point of view</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm sorry for the things I've done. When You ran to me I turned to run. But You were waiting when I came undone. And needed me someone to hold onto</segment2>
		<segment3>It's always been You in the heat of the moment. When the pain was so real and the scars on my heart were still wounds. I gotta stop hiding from the one thing thatÂ’s left to do. I know what I gotta do</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm sorry for the things I've done. When You ran to me I turned to run. But You were waiting when I came undone. And needed me someone to hold onto</segment4>
		<segment5>I wake up I wake up to the morning light to the morning light. I wake up. I wake up cause You shine so bright</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm sorry for the things I've done. When You ran to me I turned to run. Yeah, You were waiting. You were waiting. I'm sorry for the things I've done. When You ran to me I turned to run. But You were waiting when I came undone. And needed me someone to hold onto. It's always been You    </segment6>
