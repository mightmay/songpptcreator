		<segment1>Verse 1: Laying on her bed, a gasp in every breath. The people that surround her speak of what she meant. Voices slowly fading, her Maker she would meet. Eternity was waiting, her soul would be complete</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: She would hear Him say. He would say, Well done, good and faithful one  (2x)</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: The presence that consumed her made her soul to fly. When Jesus called her name out holding up the Book of Life. The war was finally over, the race is now complete. The treasure that she stored up is now laying at His feet</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: His will for her she carried out as she went through life unseen. And all the heavens talk about how this servant lived a dream. The hope that someone gave to her made her realize. The secret to her happiness was the giving of her life    </segment4>
