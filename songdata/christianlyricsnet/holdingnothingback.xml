		<segment1>I am chosen, I am free. I am Living for eternity. Free now forever</segment1>
		<segment2>You picked me up, turned me around. You set my feet on solid ground. Yours now forever</segment2>
		<segment3>And nothing's gonna hold me back. Nothing's gonna hold me back. Nothing's gonna hold me back</segment3>
		<segment4>My chains fell off. My heart was free. I'm alive to live for you. I'm alive to live for you. Amazing Love, how can it be?. You give everything for me. You give everything for me. Everything</segment4>
		<segment5>You washed my sin and shame away</segment5>
		<segment6>The slate is clean: a brand new day, Free now forever. Now boldly I approach your throne. To claim this crown through christ my own. Yours now forever</segment6>
		<segment7>And nothing's gonna hold me back. Nothing's gonna hold me back. Nothing's gonna hold me back</segment7>
		<segment8>My chains fell off. My heart was free. I'm alive to live for you. I'm alive to live for you. Amazing Love, how can it be?. You give everything for me. You give everything for me</segment8>
		<segment9>I'm free to live. Free to give. Free to be. I'm free to love you     </segment9>
