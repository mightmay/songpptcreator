		<segment1>Taste the presence of God in this place&amp;#8232;. And know that He is here&amp;#8232;. Taste the presence of God in this place&amp;#8232;. And know that it is real. Hold His hand, let His warmth&amp;#8232;. Drown out this world so cold&amp;#8232;. Hear His voice whispering&amp;#8232;. Never let it grow old</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Rest in His arms, feel the breeze&amp;#8232;. Flowing gently through our hair&amp;#8232;. See his smile, know He's pleased&amp;#8232;. When our praises feel the air&amp;#8232;. Oh my Lord,&amp;#8232;Oh my God</segment2>
		<segment3>(Verse). (Chorus x2)</segment3>
		<segment4>Taste the presence of God in this place&amp;#8232;. Taste the presence of God in this place&amp;#8232;. Taste the presence of God, the presence of God.     </segment4>
