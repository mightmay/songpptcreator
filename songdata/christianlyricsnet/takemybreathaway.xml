		<segment1>Glory so beautiful. The earth displays your majesty. How could you ever be. So mindful of someone as me</segment1>
		<segment2>You captivate. Splendor I have never seen. Nothing else can compare. Youre infinite. Youre everywhere</segment2>
		<segment3>Youre everything I cant explain. You set my heart on fire. And here I stand amazed. You take my breath away. You take my breath away</segment3>
		<segment4>See me, all I am. These empty hands. Are all I can give. That You would die so Id live. Your sacrifice I cant believe</segment4>
		<segment5>You fascinate. You stole my heart. I cant forget. And now that Ive felt your love. No turning back, I cant get enough</segment5>
		<segment6>The morning breaks, my soul awakes. You are my one desire. And here I stand amazed. You take my breath away. You take my breath away</segment6>
		<segment7>With just one word. With just one glance. Im lost in this divine romance. And every single day. More than I can say. You take my breath away</segment7>
		<segment8>Oh, oh, oh. You take my breath away. Oh, oh, oh. You take my breath away. You take my breath away    </segment8>
