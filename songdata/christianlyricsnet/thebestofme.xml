		<segment1>in my mind you never left. falling wasn't true. i had faith you flew past the sky. straight through the night. and the sun reflects the night. carrying the very same thing. in your heart that saved me. but maybe you've stopped listening. falling on my selfish ways. it takes faith to see. so close your eyes and search. deeper than just memories. i never stopped believing in you and me. your leaving never changed things. i've been here for too long. to just walk away    </segment1>
