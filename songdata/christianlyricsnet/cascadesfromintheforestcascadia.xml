		<segment1>The flashlights came out. The sound of them move. The wet of the ground. You're starting to lose. You took every breath. You traced all my steps. To start in the streets, and end what is left.</segment1>
		<segment2>I know that this is going to leave you now. I know that this is going to take you down. I know that this is going to take you out.</segment2>
		<segment3>I am everywhere, everywhere. I am all you need to know.</segment3>
		<segment4>The house that I know. The flags, they will blow. The races are where the current will go. The threat's underway. The summer lit fades. Will start in the streets, and end in my veins.</segment4>
		<segment5>Losing all control. Losing all control this light you will find. You're losing all control. Losing all control, you will fall behind.</segment5>
		<segment6>(1 Peter 2:24)    </segment6>
