		<segment1>You brought existence to what i never thought could be. a world where eternity finds description. i followed a dream only to be left in reality. You reminded me of the unexplainable. and then reshaped me by Your beauty. knowing You has reinvented love in my heart. the perfection of Love's true existence experienced for the first time. i tried so hard to wake from this dream. but instead realized that i never fell asleep    </segment1>
