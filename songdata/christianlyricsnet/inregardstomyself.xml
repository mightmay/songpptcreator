	<english>
		<segment1>Wake up Wake up My God. This is not a test and it's not too late to come clean. Get it off your chest. So steady your hand before your face and concentrate. There's got to be some stable ground left to walk on</segment1>
		<segment2>So tear another page from the book. Are you asleep or just alone. Clear this room from your lungs. And pull yourself together man</segment2>
		<segment3>On your back, you're sleeping in a bed of shame. Let the light breathe some new life into this room. It's what keeps you coming back. Made up of insatiable taste. Bury your head in your hands and sink into yourself</segment3>
		<segment4>Just what are you afraid of. You're staring truth in the face, so come on down</segment4>
		<segment5>You're busy living life now aren't you. You're busy making vows. You're coming unglued. Time is shorter than you know now. I know the light is blinding to the naked eye, so why don't you take. Steps away from being alone I swear it's not too late for you</segment5>
		<segment6>It's all worth reaching for the hand to pull you out. Wake up and step outside your box. Wake up.     </segment6>
