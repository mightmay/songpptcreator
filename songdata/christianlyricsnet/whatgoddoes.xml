		<segment1>jump in the mess of human lives undressed. and sin uconfessed, and see beauty. look at the sea of misfits and misery. and cry 'til you bleed and see beauty. that's was god does, why can't we?. waste all the best on the most dishonored guest. when she's unimpressed, and see beauty. give 'til your gone to the least deserving one. and call him your son and see beauty. everyone i know has failed me. should i let them take that cross and nail me?    </segment1>
