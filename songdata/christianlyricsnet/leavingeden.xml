		<segment1>Headlines read like a warning, we're under attack. I just waved to a stranger, he didn't wave back. And if it weren't for my TV, I wouldn't know what is real. My doctor can't do a thing for how I feel</segment1>
		<segment2>Feels like I'm leaving Eden. Feels like I'm leaving Eden</segment2>
		<segment3>People are losing their homes to hurricanes. Old lady living next door forgot her own name. Teacher is hiding her Bible, but at least she's got a job. My local Salvation Army just got robbed</segment3>
		<segment4>Feels like I'm leaving Eden. Feels like I'm leaving Eden. It's like I'm further away with every step I take. And I can't go back. Cause I'm leaving Eden</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm going, going home. I'm going, going home. There's no place, no place like home. There's no place, no place like home</segment5>
		<segment6>When you're leaving Eden. When you're leaving Eden. It's like I'm further away with every step I take. And I can't go back. Cause I'm leaving, leaving Eden.     </segment6>
