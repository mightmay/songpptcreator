		<segment1>Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, don't ever slow it down. We gonna hold it down anytime we throw it down. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, don't ever slow it down. We gonna hold it down anytime we throw it down.</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll take ya back like Galaga and Atari. I was falling into junk like Pitfall Harry. My Life was game over thats when Christ saved me. So now its bonus round ever since then he changed me. It was scary how my life was run over like frogger. I was down to one life and didn't have another. But now i'm super like the mario brothers. Pulling stunts off like tony hawk pro skater. So here's the story ain't legend of Zelda. Its about Christ who was the space invader. Hit sin like arruken from street fighter. Came from heaven now just to die for ya fella. That's why he paid the price for ya sins. On top of that he just wants to run ya life like the sims. So this right here is my advice for ya friends. Just stop and think about ya life when it ends</segment2>

Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, don't ever slow it down. We gonna hold it down anytime we throw it down.</segment3>
		<segment4>No doubt see i was just down for the count. Knocked down and beat up like mike tyson's punch out. I flipped it up and went a whole different route. And now i lift it up cuz its what i'm all about. Then i throw it out like super tecmo bowl. So every word out of my mouth would just touch a soul. Even to the ones that bust guns like halo. Or to those thugs on the run like grand theft auto. I just gotta let them know. Just living life fast like grand turismo. May get ya rich just with a whole lotta dough. But in the end bro you just left out in the cold so. To the ones on the run like pac man. We came to slam it down like NBA jam. And leave the spot blown up like missle command. Cuz that's how we do when the mics in the hand</segment4>
		<segment5>Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, don't ever slow it down. We gonna hold it down anytime we throw it down. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, don't ever slow it down. We gonna hold it down anytime we throw it down.</segment5>
		<segment6>So how i lay it just down for my people. Underground like dig dug old scholl like coleco. Thats the sound that i bump just to reach y'all. Sin got a clutch on us the resident evil. I gotta teach y'all what he did on the cross. Three days later go raid the tomb like lara croft. But all you gonna find is that my Lord is gone. Took the sin of mine took death and just shook it off. I'm going off i can't help but start braggin. It just so happens he runs the game like john madden. They cut him up first like ninja gaiden. And beat him down worse than double dragon. If you saw the passion then you know what happened. He took a bashing just to take on man's sin. That's me and you and even Charles Manson. So party people remember that when ya dancin'</segment6>
		<segment7>Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, don't ever slow it down. We gonna hold it down anytime we throw it down. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, keep it going now. Keep it going now, don't ever slow it down. We gonna hold it down anytime we throw it down.'    </segment7>
