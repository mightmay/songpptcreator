		<segment1>Won't you be a good boy. Listen closely and enjoy. All the benefits that getting wisdom brings. Give her esteem. She is priceless and supreme. She will crown your head with more honor than kings</segment1>
		<segment2>Get her boy and let yourself surrender. Run alone with her and never fall. She is wisdom and the most praiseworthy trait of all, of them all. Embrace her and the love she brings will save you. To the Father's justifiable ways. She is wisdom waiting with her prize. Garland of grace</segment2>
		<segment3>Do you have none. Do you cry out for the One. Would you offer anything to understand (Listen closely to her). Study her well. And in time the truth will tell. How it's wisdom that completely makes her man. And she will now so</segment3>
		<segment4>With her garland of grace    </segment4>
