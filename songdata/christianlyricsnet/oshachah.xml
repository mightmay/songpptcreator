		<segment1>O Shachah, where did you go?. O Shachah, where did you go?. We bow our heads and bend our knees, in a legalistic state of mind. But if nothing happens in wardly, we're only wasting our time.</segment1>
		<segment2>We won't sing what we're supposed to. We will sing what we have to.</segment2>
		<segment3>A time is coming and now has come, to worship in spirit and truth. Never mind the songs we've sung, our hearts now must carry the tune.</segment3>
		<segment4>We wont sing what we're supposed to. We will sing what we have to. O Shachah, where did we go to?. O Shachah, we're coming back to you.</segment4>
		<segment5>Come let us bow our hearts.     </segment5>
