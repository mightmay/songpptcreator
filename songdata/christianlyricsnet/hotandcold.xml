		<segment1>What day is this so I can sing. The kind of day you start recycling. You feel so good you could explode. Or stand around out by the road </segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes it makes me sick. Yah I'd rather puke. Or get poked with a stick. Than see your face </segment2>
		<segment3>Then I think of the decision I made. That makes me happy all over again. Just like birds to the sky and fish to the sea. I'm as happy as can be.     </segment3>
