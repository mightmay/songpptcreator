		<segment1>Earnestly, earnestly Lord I seek You. My soul thirsts for You. In a dry and weary land. Running our of water. God I long for You</segment1>
		<segment2>Because Your love is better than my life. I live for You. I will lift my hands up and be satisfied</segment2>
		<segment3>In the darkest night of the desert. In the deepest hole of the valley. My soul my soul clings to You. My soul my soul clings to You. Through the freezing chill of winter. In the furnace of Your fire. My soul my soul clings to You. My soul my soul clings to You    </segment3>
