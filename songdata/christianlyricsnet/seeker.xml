		<segment1>Somewhere in between, I'm somewhere. in the shadows, and my love for you. is shaken everyday, but oh how I need you. Wish I could look into your heart, cause I wonder if you care, but could I just close my eyes. and rest in you tonight, don't even speak a word.</segment1>
		<segment2>Would you pick me up just where. I am and whisper in my ear I love you. Would you tell me that you'll cry with me. and let me know you understand me. Show me how much, you suffered for us. cause I'll be willing to give all that I am to you.</segment2>
		<segment3>And will I be found by you, whoever's the seeker today?. Cause all I want to ask is.    </segment3>
