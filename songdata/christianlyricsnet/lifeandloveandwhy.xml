		<segment1>Life and love and why. Child adult then die. All of your hoping and all of your searching for what?. Ask me for what am I living and what gives me strength that i'm willing to die for </segment1>
		<segment2>Take away from me this monstrosity. 'Cause my futile thinking's not gonna solve nothing tonight. Ask me for what am I living and what gives me strength that I'm willing to die for </segment2>
		<segment3>Could it be this?. Could it be bliss?. Could it be all that I ever had missed?. Could it be true?. Can life be new?. And can I be used?. Can I be used? </segment3>
		<segment4>Give me a reason for life and for death. And a reason for drowning while I hold my breath. Something to laugh at a reason to cry. With everyone hopeless and hoping for something to hope for. Yeah, with something to hope for </segment4>
		<segment5>Could it be true?. Can life be new?. Could it be all that I am is in You?. Could it be this?. Could it be bliss?. Can it be You?. Can it be You?    </segment5>
