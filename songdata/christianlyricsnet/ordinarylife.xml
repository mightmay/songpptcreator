		<segment1>Take me and invade me. Make me someone new. Wake me from the dead. And break me with the truth </segment1>
		<segment2>Move me and disturb me. Interrupt my peace. Tear open my heart. And pull me to my knees </segment2>
		<segment3>There's a world outside. That is burning. While I'm turning blinded eyes. While I stand by </segment3>
		<segment4>I won't survive. To live this ordinary life. I'm not alive. To live this ordinary life </segment4>
		<segment5>And I will try. To see this world I live in. With Your eyes. To love this world You've given. With my life. To see this world I live in. With Your eyes. To love this world You've given. With my life    </segment5>
