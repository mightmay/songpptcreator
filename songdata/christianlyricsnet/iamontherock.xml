		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman and John Elefante. Based on Matthew 7:24-27, 16:18</segment1>
		<segment2>The earth is shakin'. It's like a bad dream. This world is crumblin'. Comin' apart at the seam but. I am on the Rock </segment2>
		<segment3>Everywhere I'm turning it's only bad news. This bomb is tickin' and we're getting to the end of the fuse but. I am on the Rock </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). I am on the Rock, the sure foundation. I am on the Rock, His revelation. Though the winds may blow. And though the floods may grow. I shall not be moved, 'cause I am on the Rock </segment4>
		<segment5>The storm's approaching, I'm standing high and dry. Firmly planted on the Rock that is higher than I. I am on the Rock </segment5>
		<segment6>Kingdoms failing, they fall around me. Plans eroded, and washing away to the sea </segment6>
		<segment7>There is no Rock in this world but our God    </segment7>
