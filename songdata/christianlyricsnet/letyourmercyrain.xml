		<segment1>God, You have done great things. God, You give grace to the weak. And bless the brokenhearted. With a song of praise to sing. You reached down and lifted us up. You came running, looking for us. And now there's nothing. And no one beyond Your love</segment1>
		<segment2>You're the overflow. You're the fountain of my heart. Let Your mercy rain. Let Your mercy rain on us</segment2>
		<segment3>You're the faithful one. When the world's falling apart. Let Your mercy rain. Let Your mercy rain on us</segment3>
		<segment4>How deep, how wide, how long, how high is Your love .. is Your love. How deep, how wide, how long, how high is Your love .. is Your love. Oh, God</segment4>
		<segment5>Let it rain    </segment5>
