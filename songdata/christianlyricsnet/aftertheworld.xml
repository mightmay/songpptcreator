		<segment1>You break the glass, try to hide your face. Recorded lines that just will not erase. And buried in your loss of innocence. You wonder if you'll find it again</segment1>
		<segment2>Was I there for the worst of all your pain?. And was I there when your blue sky ran away?. Was I there when the rains were flooding you?. Off of your feet. Those were My tears falling down for you, falling down for you. Chorus: I'm the One that you've been looking for. I'm the One that you've been waiting for. I've had My eyes on you ever since you were born. I will love you after the rain falls down. I will love you after the sun goes out. I'll have My eyes on you after the world is no more</segment2>
		<segment3>Did I arrange the light of your first day?. Did I create the rhythm your heart makes?. Could you believe when your candle starts to fade?. I want to be the One that you believe. Could take it all away, take your heart away. (Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>Isn't My life a clear sign since I have crossed over this chasm. To fill the space between Me and you?. And I will do it all over again. Just look for Me, just wait for Me</segment4>
		<segment5>The One you've been looking for. The One you've been waiting for. You won't have to look anymore. (Chorus). The One you've been looking for. The One you've been waiting for.     </segment5>
