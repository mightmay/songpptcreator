		<segment1>Carry me away. Back in time to when I met You. Take all this guilt and shame. That buried me, and bury me in You</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I want to be dead but still alive. I want to breathe hope instead of choking. I want to feel the fire deep inside. Burn through me and carry me away</segment2>
		<segment3>How fake could I be? You see through me. You see right through me. Would You sing to me?. And take me back to when I met you</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I hear You calling me. I feel so far from home. You can see through my past. You've never let me go</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
