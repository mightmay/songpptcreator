		<segment1>What this world needs. Is not another one hit wonder with an axe to grind. Another two bit politician peddling lies. Another three ring circus society</segment1>
		<segment2>What this world needs. Is not another sign waving super saint that's better than you. Another ear pleasing candy man afraid of the truth. Another prophet in an Armani suit</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: What this world needs is a Savior who will rescure. A Spirit who will lead. A Father who will love them. In their time of need. A Savior who will rescue. A Spirit who will lead. A Father who will love. That's what this world needs</segment3>
		<segment4>What this world needs. Is for us to care more about the inside than the outside. Have we become so blind that we can't see. God's gotta change her heart before He changes her shirt</segment4>
		<segment5>What this world needs. Is for us to stop hiding behind our relevance. Blending in so well that people can't see the difference. And it's the difference that sets the world free</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>*Children talking*</segment7>
		<segment8>Jesus is our Savior, that's what this world needs. Fathers arms around you, that's what this world needs. That's what this world needs     </segment8>
