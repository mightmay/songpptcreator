		<segment1>Don't care about money don't care about fame. Not chasing some great accolade. Oh I want more. I've never been much for flattery. So don't waste that kind of talk on me. Oh I want more</segment1>
		<segment2>More than this whole world can offer. More than all that time destroys. And all I've wanted here can't satisfy my wanting. 'Cause I was made made for more</segment2>
		<segment3>Well I've climbed as high as status goes. But I've got social vertigo. Oh I want more. Never thought my gifts would seal my worth. I never wanted fans just wanted church. Oh I want more</segment3>
		<segment4>And after all I wasn't made for here. But I give myself to all you gave</segment4>
		<segment5>Well I want to see my kids grow old. And always have your hand to hold. Oh I was made made for more. Made for more    </segment5>
