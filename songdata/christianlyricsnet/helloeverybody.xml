		<segment1>Intro: I do this for my family reunions. This is for my grandma. All my people in Nebraska. My cousin Simeon. A check it out a check it out. . Hello everybody, how do you do. My name's Pigeon Johnny. LA symph's the crew. I know what you're thinking. Who is this fool. My name's Pigeon Johnny. I make the ladies drool. Not really but it sounds cool though. . Chorus: All my party people in the place go (Hey). All my nerds on the internet go (Hey). If you showing up late to work go (Hey). All my college drop out niggas go (Hey). If you're working temp jobs let's go (Hey). All the black white girls let's go (Hey). To all the white black girls let's to (Hey). To all the prettier Whittier girls let's go. Lyrics provided by http://www.kovideo.net/. Source. . Met her at the Derby. Over the weekend. I said my name's Pigeon Johnny. And she grinned. I said can I get the 7 digits. And she said &quot;NO&quot;. I said but but but but but, my name's Pigeon Johnny. She said she had to go. Not really but it sounds cool though. . Chorus. . One time for your mind you'll find. Pigeon Jack dipped and well equipped wIth a rhyme. 100% I dodge dent try to repent. But usually fall when I start to climb. I'm modern day saint PJ. 6th and Alvarado becomes a clich?. Never that change format. And double that double down Jack. Don't ask him but what she say. Cause I don't really care what they think. Tomorrow they'll be doing my song and will be claiming it's new. And 2 years ago they used to say that ain't even hip hop. Now they dipped in a Sinatra suit. Acting real silly thinking PJ's a joke. But they'll be doing exactly what I do. I tell you what I'll give you my style right now to save time. Cause it takes time for you to chew obviously. . Chorus. . That's what I'm saying y'all. All the way from Mexico. To 6th and Alvardo. Put your hands down and roll ya'll    </segment1>
