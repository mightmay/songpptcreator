		<segment1>Was God smiling when He spoke the words that made the world?. And did He cry about the flood?. What does God's voice sound like when He sings, when He's angry?. These are just a few things that the angels have on me </segment1>
		<segment2>Well, I can't fly at least not yet. I've got no halo on my head. And I can't even start to picture Heaven's beauty. But I've been shown the Savior's love. The Grace of God has raised me up. To show me things the angels long to look into. And I know things the Angels only wish they knew </segment2>
		<segment3>I have seen the dark and desperate place where sin will take you. I've felt loneliness and shame. And I have watched the blinding light of grace. Come breaking through with a sweetness only tasted. By the forgiven and redeemed </segment3>
		<segment4>And someday I'll sit down with my angel friends. Up in heaven. And they'll tell me about Creation. And I'll tell them a story of Grace </segment4>
		<segment5>Well, I can't fly at least not yet. I've got no halo on my head. And I can't even start to picture Heaven's beauty. But I've been shown a Savior's love. The Grace of God has raised me up. To show me things the angels long to look into. And I know things the Angels only wish they knew </segment5>
