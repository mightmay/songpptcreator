		<segment1>It would be easier if you were just a thought in my head. Simply something that I once read. A belief needing my defense. And it would be easier if you were something I once knew. A hope just to hold on to. But you're holding out your hands</segment1>
		<segment2>You came to take us back to the start. You came to touch the hardness of our hearts. You gave us truth that truth is who You are. It's who You are</segment2>
		<segment3>And its not enough to just say, &quot;I believe.&quot;. Cause truth is that talk is cheap. So grace give me eyes to see</segment3>
		<segment4>Flesh and blood You offer us. Oh, to eat the bread and drink the cup. Oh, to taste, to see, to feel, to touch. Emmanuel, God with us. Emmanuel, God with us</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause You came to break the chains apart. To wake the dead and the sleeping of our hearts. You gave us truth that truth is who You are. It's who You are</segment5>
