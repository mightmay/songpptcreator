		<segment1>Rain rain on my face. It hasn't stopped raining for days. My world is a flood. Slowly I become one with the mud </segment1>
		<segment2>But if I can't swim after forty days. And my mind is crushed by the crashing waves. Lift me up so high that I cannot fall. Lift me up. Lift me up - When I'm falling. Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying. Lift me up - I need you to hold me. Lift me up - Keep me from drowning again </segment2>
		<segment3>Down pour on my soul. Splashing in the ocean I'm losing control. Dark sky all around. I can't feel my feet touching the ground </segment3>
		<segment4>But if I can't swim after forty days. And my mind is crushed by the crashing waves. Lift me up so high that I cannot fall. Lift me up. Lift me up - When I'm falling. Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying. Lift me up - I need you to hold me. Lift me up - Keep me from drowning again </segment4>
		<segment5>Calm the storms that drench my eyes. And dry the streams still flowing. Casting down all the waves of sin. And guilt that overthrow me </segment5>
		<segment6>If I can't swim after forty days. And my mind is crushed by the crashing waves. Lift me up so high that I cannot fall - Lift me up    </segment6>
