		<segment1>Time falls off the face of the earth. Every moment feels just like the first time, you. You found me. And the heavy things that were holding me down. You carried away and I seem to be weightless now. I'm weightless now</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). Theres nothing left to say. Nothing left to do. Nothing left to prove. I'm in love with You. You're the one. You're the one. So tell me can you see what you mean to me. That you'll never leave. I'm a fool for you. You're the one. You're the one</segment2>
		<segment3>The world sure had me trapped under ice. Yeah I once was numb. But now I'm so alive. I'm so alive. Now I dont wanna take. One more breath. Without you here. To share it with. It's becoming clear. I cant live without you. Oh no</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh and I wont see one more sunrise. Without you here with me</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus).     </segment6>
