		<segment1>I got the call at 2am, it awoke me from my sleep. I didnt recognize the voice, it was nervous and quite deep. He said that she was taken fast, she probably never knew. Maybe he was comforting me, or maybe it was true</segment1>
		<segment2>The last time that I saw her she was walking out the door. I didnt think to hug her, it was just a trip to the store. Did I say I love you? Did she know it when she died?. When she had her last glance at me, did I look her in the eye?</segment2>
		<segment3>Though I dont see, I still believe. Theres a purpose. Youre the eye of the storm. We fall asleep but we believe. You will wake us. And Your bride will come home</segment3>
		<segment4>I took her to a restaurant, she spilled her drink on me. In anger I belittled her, I never said I was sorry. And now its those memories that haunt me in my sleep. How often we love someone, but were just to proud to speak</segment4>
		<segment5>Though I dont see, I still believe. Theres a purpose. Youre the eye of the storm. We fall asleep but we believe. You will wake us. And Your bride will come home</segment5>
		<segment6>When I was at the funeral. I tried hard not to cry. I didnt want to grieve like the world. As though the lost had died</segment6>
		<segment7>Shes my sleeping beauty. For now shes resting in peace. But one day, Redeemer, Redeemer. Youll wake her from her sleep</segment7>
		<segment8>I did alright till I went in her room. I buckled under the load. Tomorrow if the rain stops. well put a cross on the side of the road</segment8>
		<segment9>God is good all the time. Even when little girls die     </segment9>
