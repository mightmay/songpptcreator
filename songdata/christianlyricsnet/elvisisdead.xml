		<segment1>That voice inside my brain. Elvis talking to me again. I think I'm going insane. He says that he's my friend. But I know what he said. Is a lie cause Elvis is dead. Now I know that what I see. Can't be him 'cuz this guy's skinny. Why can't I see that Elvis is me. And I oughta know it. Need to change I'm way too strange. And I shouldn't show it. I got too much time to drink. And no Coke to think. Elvis talked to me today. He told me what to say    </segment1>
