		<segment1>Love, give me time. Need a moment to make up my mind. Light, light of the day. I can watch you slowly fade away. Come on, love, open my eyes. Can't see past the lies </segment1>
		<segment2>If only for a second chance with you. If only for a second glance at you </segment2>
		<segment3>Love, would calm me down. I missed out on the here and now. Could peace likght my way. Where'd you go, are you here to stay. Come on, love, open my eyes. Can't see past the lies     </segment3>
