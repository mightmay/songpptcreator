		<segment1>Chorus: Every time I fall a little bit harder. Every time I fall a little bit farther. Every time I fall. I fall right back into your arms</segment1>
		<segment2>Every time I try. To explain the reason why. I have let you down. I fall to the ground</segment2>
		<segment3>What is it you see in me. That makes you believe. No matter how far I stray. I will still find the way</segment3>
		<segment4>Just when I think I'm not strong enough. You reach out to me and you lift me up</segment4>
		<segment5>Repeat chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Time and time again. When I think I've reached the end. It's your voice I hear. That draws me near</segment6>
		<segment7>I don't know what makes you stay. When I act this way. No matter what we've been through. I can turn to you</segment7>
		<segment8>Just when I think I'm not strong enough. You reach out to me and you lift me up</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus)</segment9>
		<segment10>You find the beauty in my imperfections. The guiding light in all my misdirection. And when I think you've finally given up. You fill my heart with unconditional love</segment10>
		<segment11>Every time I fall. I fall back in your arms</segment11>
		<segment12>(Chorus x4)    </segment12>
