		<segment2>Whoa no. Im not giving up now. Whoa</segment2>
		<segment3>Lifes a fight of wrong and right. Thats tearing me apart. Oh but what the cross has done. Yeah the world will try to battle for my heart. But the war is already won</segment3>

		<segment5>Lifes a fight of wrong and right. Thats tearing me apart. Oh but what the cross has done. Yeah the world will try to battle for my heart. But the war is already won</segment5>
		<segment6>Whoa. Im not giving up now. Whoa. Im not giving in</segment6>
		<segment7>Lifes a fight of wrong and right. Thats tearing me apart. Oh but what the cross has done. Yeah the world will try to battle for my heart. But the war is already won     </segment7>
