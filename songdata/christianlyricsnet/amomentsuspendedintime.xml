		<segment1>Held captive, I'm a prisoner. In the back room where the water leaks and I'm oh, so cold. Command me on what to do, but you know neither you or I are in. Control</segment1>
		<segment2>There's nothing left for me here. I'm grabbing on what's left of this hole, it's all too real this can't be. Happening</segment2>
		<segment3>Never again, ever again, will I say I'm Ok. I'm scared of the fate that will become mine</segment3>
		<segment4>No time to talk you know the drill</segment4>
		<segment5>Under my desk this can't be it. I'm only dreaming, I've got to be dreaming. But I can't get up. No time to talk, not this time, this is my place. This is where I arrange</segment5>
		<segment6>It's so funny how we see things so clear when we have no time left to. Live</segment6>
		<segment7>So lay back now and take it in. I won't say a word. I won't say anything</segment7>
		<segment8>I can't believe how it feels. To stand here in this room. And feel like it's going to blow. I think we're all going to blow</segment8>
		<segment9>I've got to be dreaming. We've got to be dreaming. Please don't wake me up. This is the end.     </segment9>
