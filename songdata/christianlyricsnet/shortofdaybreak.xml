		<segment1>another year has gone by. time just took it away. friends have changed. clear skies watched over us. but we've had our share of rain. romance still sits untouched. by the water she waits patiently. hoping i'll take her home someday. to think i lost her. that my dreams were her only place. but for her i've learned to wait. a smile remains on my face knowing. God hold her at night. letting her know i'm on my way. so i'll hold my head high. for love may be a day. i can't say. but tomorrow awaits. bringing me closer to you    </segment1>
