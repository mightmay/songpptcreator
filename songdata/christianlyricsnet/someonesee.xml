		<segment1>As funny as it may seem, It's no laughing matter though they point at him. The punchline went all wrong this time. Someone see if he's all right. Days pass and life goes on. The &quot;jokes&quot; bounce off as he hums his favorite song. Self esteem's losing the fight. Someone see if he's all right. Can't I care just once to, Take a stand, To take a side?</segment1>
		<segment2>Through the crowd we stare, We cowards here, We cowards there.</segment2>
		<segment3>Alone is his best friend. What we don't know is that he's at his last end. Maybe I should talk to him?. I'm sure that they'll talk to him. Where can he find his comfort?. We're all enclosed in our tight circle of friends. A circle has no open sides. Someone see if he's all right.</segment3>
		<segment4>He laughed out loud alone. He spoke alone. Lived life alone. He wouldn't be alone if on my own I'd stand alone.    </segment4>
