		<segment1>I've heard it said today is all we're given, Tomorrow may not come so you better start living, I guess it all depends on your point of view, yeah.</segment1>
		<segment2>Pardon me if I just don't listen. To everything the world says I'm missing, There's nothing here. And now I'm gonna hold on to, hold on to.</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: I'm living in the days ahead. I'm already dancing on the streets of gold. And I can't stop celebrating in my soul, I'm living in the days ahead. Nothing on earth could ever compare. I can't wait for the day when I get there, When I see Jesus face to face. Tell me what could be better, Tell me what could be better.</segment3>
		<segment4>If home is where the heart is. Then I'm in heaven. It's the promise of tomorrow. That I've been living, Who is waiting there I am living far, yeah.</segment4>
		<segment5>He's everything I love and I believe in. I can hardly wait just to see Him, To here Him say well done. I couldn't ask for more, I couldn't ask for more.</segment5>
		<segment6>(CHORUS)</segment6>
		<segment7>Life is full of ups and downs, Insideouts, round and rounds, You can't blame me for dreaming about it, yeah.</segment7>
		<segment8>(CHORUS)    </segment8>
