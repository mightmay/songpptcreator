		<segment1>Im not the clothes Im wearing. Im not a photograph. Im not the car I drive</segment1>
		<segment2>Im not the money I make. Im not the things I lack. Im not the songs that I write</segment2>
		<segment3>I am  who I am. I am who I am</segment3>
		<segment4>There are true things inside of me. I have been afraid to see. I believe, help my unbelief. Would you say again what you said to me. I am loved and I am free. I believe, help my unbelief</segment4>
		<segment5>Im not the house I live in. Im not the man I love. Im not the mistakes that I carry</segment5>
		<segment6>Im not the food that I dont eat. Im not what Im above. Im not my scars and my history</segment6>
		<segment7>There are true things inside of me. I have been afraid to see. I believe, help my unbelief. Would you say again what you said to me. I am loved and I am free. I believe, help my unbelief</segment7>
		<segment8>To your love Im waking up. In your love Im waking up.     </segment8>
