		<segment1>That is not at all how. we thought it was supposed to be. We had so many plans for you. we had so many dreams. And now youve gone away. and left us with the memories of your smile. And nothing we can say. and nothing we can do. Can take away the pain. the pain of losing you</segment1>
		<segment2>We can cry with hope. we can say goodbye with hope. 'Cause we know our goodbye is not the end. We can grieve with hope. because we believe with hope. Theres a place where well see your face again. Well see your face again</segment2>
		<segment3>Never have I known. anything so hard to understand. Never have I questioned more. the wisdom of Gods plan. But through the cloud of tears. I see the Father smile and say well done. And I imagine you. where you wanted most to be. Seeing all your dreams come true. 'Cause now youre home and now youre free</segment3>
		<segment4>We can cry with hope, we can say goodbye with hope. 'Cause we know our goodbye is not the end. We can grieve with hope, because we believe with hope. Theres a place where well see your face again. Well see your face again</segment4>
		<segment5>We have this hope like as an anchor. 'Cause we believe that everything God promised us is true</segment5>
		<segment6>So we can cry with hope, we can say goodbye with hope. 'Cause we know our goodbye is not the end. We can grieve with hope, because we believe with hope. Theres a place. By Gods grace. Theres a place where well see your face again.     </segment6>
