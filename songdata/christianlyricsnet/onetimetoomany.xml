		<segment1>All the little pieces of time. Are adding up to nothing again. You'd think I'd finally get this right. I think I've fought it one time to many. Just one time to many</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm the king of nothing today. Looking up to heaven I call your name</segment2>
		<segment3>Come on and change me. Cause you know what I need. Could you break away the ice frozen around my heart. Could you reach through. And help me to know you. Cause I'm stranded in this place. Falling on my face over and over again</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm holding onto all my mistakes. Thinking I'm not worthy of your grace. I need to know you love me tonight. Cause I've fallen one time too many. Just one time to many</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm the king of nothing today. Looking up to heaven I call Your name</segment5>
		<segment6>Am I really worth the price you paid for me. I can't believe it?. I hear you say</segment6>
		<segment7>That you'll change me. Cause yo know what I need. And You'll break away the ice frozen around my heart. And You'll reach through. And help me to know you. Cause standing in this place. Calling on your name over and over. Come on and change me. Cause you know what I need. Could you break away the ice frozen around my heart. Could you reach through. And help me to know you. Cause I'm stranded in this place. Falling on my face over and over again    </segment7>
