		<segment1>Torn from the only thing i know broken off struggling to hold on burn me rip me tear me apart scalpel cuts and stabs digs in my lungs my face piece by piece limb by limb you refuse to listen today's society bends and tears the truth misinformed public abides with closed eyes ignorance bleeds through my short sold life i was flesh i was blood i had hands i had fetts eyes that would see no more supply but deny whose right to kill whose right to murder my eyes begin to close..open your eyes.     </segment1>
