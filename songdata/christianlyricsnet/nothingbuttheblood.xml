		<segment1>Verse 1. Your blood speaks a better word than all the empty claims. I've heard upon this earth, speaks righteousness for me. And stands in my defense; Jesus it's Your blood</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. What can wash away our sins?. What can make us whole again?. Nothing but the blood, nothing but the blood of Jesus. What can wash us pure as snow. Welcomed as the friends of God?. Nothing but Your blood, nothing but Your blood. King Jesus, King Jesus</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2. Your cross testifies in grace. Tells the father's heart to make a way for us. Now boldly we approach; not earthly confidence, it's only. by Your blood</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge. It's the blood, it's the blood. It's the blood, it's the blood. It's the blood, it's the blood. Yeah, what can wash us?    </segment4>
