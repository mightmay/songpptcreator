		<segment1>I can't keep my eyes open, And you just wanna talk. Can't this wait til the morning, Just wait til the morning, Where bright lights abound, And a conquering spirit returns,</segment1>
		<segment2>To this hollowed out cavity.</segment2>
		<segment3>I can't keep my eyes open, And you just wanna talk. Can't this wait til the morning, Just wait til the morning, Where bright lights abound, And a conquering spirit returns, To this hollowed out cavity.</segment3>
		<segment4>So hold your breath, Hold your hands tight to your chest. It's like heaven and hell meeting</segment4>
		<segment5>Under your bed once again. So hold your breath, Hold your hands tight to your chest. It's like heaven and hell meeting. Under your bed once again.</segment5>
		<segment6>. I can't keep my eyes open, And you just wanna talk. Can't this wait til the morning, Just wait til the morning, Where bright lights abound, And a conquering spirit returns,</segment6>
