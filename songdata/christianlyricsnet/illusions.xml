		<segment1>How could I ever go back. Back to the life. Where I lived amongst the dead. Who have forgotten how to feel. And become slaves to memory. And wishful thinking. But your love has set me free. As you awaken every star. That has been sleeping. In the constellation of my soul. How could I go back to live amongst the dead. Those who imprisoned beauty. I never want to leave your arms. So I wait in hope for your embrace. Illusions of what I thought was love. Now I have clear sight to see. That I have left nothing behind    </segment1>
