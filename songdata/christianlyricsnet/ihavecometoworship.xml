		<segment1>Many mighty rivers I have crossed. Many barren deserts have I seen. And still my heart beats strong. For You, Oh Lord. For You have been my shelter. I all of my need</segment1>
		<segment2>I have come to worship you. Oh, and I have come to worship you</segment2>
		<segment3>A willing soul and a thankful heart. To find a holy passion just for You. And turn away from the things. That break your heart. And live a life of sacrifice. Just for You</segment3>
		<segment4>For only You are worthy. Only You are worthy. Only You are worthy. Of the praise this heart brings    </segment4>
