		<segment1> know that look in your eyes. I see the pain behind your smile. Please don't hold it all inside. Together we can run. To the finish line. And when you are tired. I'll carry you </segment1>
		<segment2>I can't walk this road without you. You cannot go it alone. We were never meant to make it on our own. When the load becomes too heavy. And your feet too tired to walk. I will carry you and we'll be carried on </segment2>
		<segment3>Share your burden now. I will listen. And when I'm weak. Will you hold me to the truth. That we can go on, For we are carried. Three strands of chord. Cannot be easily torn </segment3>
		<segment4>I can't walk this road without you. You cannot go it alone. We were never meant to make it on our own. When the load becomes too heavy. And your feet too tired to walk. I will carry you and we'll be carried on </segment4>
		<segment5>God will carry us (4X) </segment5>
		<segment6>Before I say one more word. Here me say I love You. My love comes from a heart that overflows. With love Who fills me. Comforts me. Comforts you. With arms stretched out He said, &quot;I'll carry you&quot; </segment6>
		<segment7>I can't walk this road without you. You cannot go it alone. We were never meant to make it on our own. When the load becomes too heavy. And your feet to tired to walk. I will carry you and we'll be carried on.     </segment7>
