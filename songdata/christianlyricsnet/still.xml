		<segment1>Hide me now. Under your wings. Cover me. Within Your mighty hands</segment1>
		<segment2>When the oceans rise and thunders roar. I will soar with You, above the storm. Father, You are king over the flood. I will be still and know You are God</segment2>
		<segment3>Find rest my soul, in Christ alone. Know His power, in quietness and trust	    </segment3>
