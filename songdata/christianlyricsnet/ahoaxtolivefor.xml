		<segment1>You're all just staring, angry faces, begging for a place to die. Or I could leave you where you stand, Up upon that hill that'll fall to the wayside. </segment1>
		<segment2>This hoax to live for, dictating regulation of thoughts. This hoax to live for, the very plague that kills us all. </segment2>
		<segment3>And in this scene, I play the protagonist, and as well I play the opposed. Or I could leave you where you stand. All alone in the hall, your trap for the meantime. And you call this home, no home I've ever known. </segment3>
		<segment4>This hoax to live for, dictating regulation of thoughts. This hoax to live for, the very plague that kills us all. </segment4>
		<segment5>This isn't war, but these are still battles. And battles make it all die out. </segment5>
		<segment6>This hoax to live for, dictating regulation of thoughts. This hoax to live for, the very plague that kills us all.     </segment6>
