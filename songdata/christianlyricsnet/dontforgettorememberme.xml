		<segment1>Don't Forget to Remember Me</segment1>
		<segment2>. Eighteen years had come and gone. For Momma they flew by. But for me they drove on and on. We were loadin' up that Chevy. Both tryin' not to cry. Mamma kept on talkin' puttin' off goodbye. Then she took my hand and said. Baby don't forget</segment2>
		<segment3>1st Chorus: Before you hit the highway you better stop for gas. And there's a fifty in the ashtray in case you run short on cash. Here's a map and here's a Bible if you ever lose your way. Just one more thing before you leave. Don't forget to remember me</segment3>
		<segment4>This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home. And those bills there on the counter. Keep tellin' me I'm on my own. Just like every Sunday I called Mama up last night. And even when it's not I tell her everything's all right. Before we hung up I said. Hey Mama don't forget</segment4>
		<segment5>2nd Chorus: To tell my baby sister I'll see her in the fall. Tell Mema that I miss her yeah I should give her a call. And make sure that you tell daddy that I'm still his little girl. Yeah I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be. But don't forget to remember me</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge: Tonight I find myself kneelin' by the bed to pray. Haven't done this in a while so i don't know what to say. But Lord I feel so small sometimes in this big ol' place. Yeah I know there's more important things. But don't forget to remember me.     </segment6>
