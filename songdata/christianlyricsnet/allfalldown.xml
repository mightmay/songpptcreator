		<segment1>Your Word Oh Lord is eternal. It stands firm. Your faithfulness continues through all the earth. All creation hangs on your every word</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). With the sound of your voice. Water still, you are Lord over all. With the touch of your robe, the sick are healed. And for you Jesus we all fall down</segment2>
		<segment3>My soul finds rest and comfort. From only you. My fortress and my rock. I won't be moved. You are my cornerstone, who's love endures</segment3>
		<segment4>With the sound of your voice. Water still, you are Lord over all. With the touch of your robe, the sick are healed. And for you Jesus we all fall down</segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge). And I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. And I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made</segment5>
		<segment6>With the sound of your voice. Water still, you are Lord over all. With the touch of your robe, the sick are healed. Jesus we all fall down</segment6>
		<segment7>Water sill, you are Lord over all. With the touch of your robe, the sick are healed. For you Jesus we all fall down</segment7>
		<segment8>We fall down, we fall down    </segment8>
