		<segment1>been working overtime. and gettin' sick of these crazy games. i'll be a satellite. and wait for someone to enter my gaze</segment1>
		<segment2>i see you like a star in the sky. and i love it. yeah, the light in yours eyes. and i wonder. when you're looking in mine. do you see them. like a star in the sky</segment2>
		<segment3>you got me falling for ya. and i won't stop 'til i hit the clouds. see i don't wanna hide these feelings. or even try to figure them out</segment3>
		<segment4>sparks flyin' all around. electricity. dance with me, dance with me, dance with me. ten feet of the ground. no gravity. fly with me, fly with me</segment4>
		<segment5>way up high satellite. you and i identify</segment5>
