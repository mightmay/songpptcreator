		<segment1>Here I am without a place to stand. Lost inside the desert of my heart. All of my mistakes are adding up. Take them all away, I've had enough. Heal my jaded soul. And I'm going to feel the weight letting go</segment1>
		<segment2>Be alive in me. I know I'm Yours forever. Be alive in me. I know I'm Yours. So take me and shake me. I know I'm needing you to be alive in me</segment2>
		<segment3>I need you here so we can talk it out. I'm giving you the things that pull me down. Jesus, can you teach me how to stand. And if I fall, I want to fall into Your hands. So heal my jaded soul. 'Cuz I want to feel the weight letting go</segment3>
		<segment4>Be alive in me. I know I'm Yours forever. Be alive in me. I know I'm Yours. So take me and shake me. I know I'm needing You to be alive in me. I'm Yours. I'm Yours</segment4>
		<segment5>Excite me. Ignite me. Relight this fire. Excite me. Ignite me. Relight this fire</segment5>
		<segment6>Be alive in me. I know I'm yours forever. Be alive in me. 'Cuz I know I'm Yours. So take me and shake me. I know I'm needing You to be alive in me. I'm Yours. Be alive in me. I'm Yours. Be alive in me    </segment6>
