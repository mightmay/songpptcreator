		<segment1>Well, it took the hand of God Almighty. To part the waters of the sea. But it only took one little lie. To separate you and me. Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are</segment1>
		<segment2>And they say that one day Joshua. Made the sun stand still in the sky. But I can't even keep these thoughts. Of you from passing by. Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. We are frail. We are fearfully and wonderfully made. Forged in the fires of human passion. Choking on the fumes of selfish rage. And with these our hells and our heavens. So few inches apart. We must be awfully small. And not as strong as we think we are</segment3>
		<segment4>And the Master said their faith was. Gonna make them mountains move. But me, I tremble like a hill on a fault line. Just at the thought of how I lost you. Oh, we are not as strong as we think we are</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>And if you make me laugh well I know. I could make you like me. Cause when I laugh I can be a lot of fun. But we can't do that I know that it is frightening. What I don't know is why we can't hold on. We can't hold on</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>When you love you walk on the water. Just don't stumble on the waves. We all want to go there somethin' awful. But to stand there it takes some grace. 'Cause oh, we are not as strong. As we think we are    </segment8>
