		<segment1>You've got an extra special heart and a perfect light that shines through. But it seems like the hardest part is shining back at you. So forgive me if I don't know what to do when you look at me. There can be no hesitation; there cannot be a close second to you. I've got a perfectly normal heart, bruised and broken from within. At times I don't know how to start to let you in here.    </segment1>
