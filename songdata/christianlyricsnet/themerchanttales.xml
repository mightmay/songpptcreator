		<segment1>Theres something that Ive been dying to tell you. For a death in me is a death in you. Absorbed in the thought of doing my best. Everyone takes a staggering pleasure in proving their falseness.</segment1>
		<segment2>You are the air I breath, you are the steps I take, you are the words I speak, you are the life in me.</segment2>
		<segment3>Lets see Your mission for I am a warrior. Can I walk the plank and still hold composure. Sinking down to the ocean deep. Im moving forward, but Ive failed to see. Sinking down to the ocean deep. Im moving forward, but Ive failed to see.</segment3>
		<segment4>I will not break, my feet are planted firmly on the ground. Take a look at me, its who I am. You try to change it, but youre pounding the sand. Close your eyes, let the light surround you. Dont look back, for youre now on your way. Close your eyes, let the light surround you. Dont look back, for youre now on your way.</segment4>
		<segment5>Well light the match and burn this place to the ground. All misconceptions will be gone without a sound. Oh God the end is near before the time runs out. Lets save these hearts and minds, for soon You will come down. Ill be the filament and Youll be the fire. Youll be the truth, and Ill be the liar. Ill be the filament and Youll be the fire. Youll be the truth, and Ill be the liar.</segment5>
		<segment6>Ill be the filament and Youll be the fire. Ill be the filament and Youll be the fire. Ill be the filament and Youll be the fire..</segment6>
		<segment7>This place is burning down. This place is burning down. Oh, this place is burning down. Oh, this place is burning down. Oh..     </segment7>
