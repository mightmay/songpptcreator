		<segment1>I look around and I feel like, things changed. And I dont know why. Everyday that passes by I feel so far away. I can see in the distance, You have the rest of me. I put my trust in you, as I look beyond today. Its all becoming clear.</segment1>
		<segment2>I do not belong in a world of broken pieces. I was meant to be in the arms of. Your redemption. I am moving on to the place of Your perfection. Cause I do not belong, no. I do not belong</segment2>
		<segment3>When the world is behind me on the day that. I breathe my last. In the face of eternity theres. Hope cause I believe. When I look to the heavens. And the future that you hold. It makes it easier to see beyond today. Now Im looking to the sky</segment3>
		<segment4>This world is not my home. Im a stranger in this land. But I am not alone. When I do not belong</segment4>
