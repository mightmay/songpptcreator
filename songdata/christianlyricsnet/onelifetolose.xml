		<segment1>I'm torn again between my pride, my old friend. And who you've called me to be. I've sworn again to lay it down, to bring an end. To this life lived for me</segment1>
		<segment2>For I've one life to lose, one chance to find. A newer, better me, the old one left behind. For there's one Lord who leads though steep the cost. I have learned when I am lost, it's there that I am found</segment2>
		<segment3>I am found as your daughter, as your child. As one purchased by Your blood. And though there's nothing I can add to such a perfect sacrifice. How can I offer you less than all my life?</segment3>
		<segment4>For I've one life to lose, one chance to find. A newer, better me, the old one left behind. For there's one Lord who leads how steep the cost. I have learned when I am lost, it's there that I am found. It's there that I am found</segment4>
		<segment5>For I've one life to lose, one chance to find. A newer, better me, the old one left behind. For there's one Lord who leads how steep the cost. I have learned when I am lost. I have learned when I am lost, it's there that I am found. It's there that I am found    </segment5>
