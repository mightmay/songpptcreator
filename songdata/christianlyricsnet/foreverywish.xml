		<segment1>Watching from the shadows, stealing all thats left. Great deceiver, (so) beautiful. Fading moments, passing like years. Wish everything. was perfect.</segment1>
		<segment2>Im all Ill ever need, so go away. Keep your lies. For every wish, theres hope and time.</segment2>
		<segment3>Now its complicated, I wish I was medicated. Theres gotta be some way out of here. Looking for release. to end the greatest need.</segment3>
		<segment4>Im all Ill ever need, so go away. Keep your lies. For every wish. theres hope and time. (x 2)</segment4>
		<segment5>GOD HELP ME!!. GOD HELP ME!!</segment5>
		<segment6>Gotta peel away the skin, just find The Truth in here. (x 2)</segment6>
		<segment7>Im all Ill ever need, so go away. Keep your lies. For every wish, theres hope and time. (x 2)</segment7>
