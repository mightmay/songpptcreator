		<segment1>Riots and violence!. Thanks for the rainbow. but I'll make my own. Dance the night away. Thanks for the rainbow. but I'll make my own. Come on, come on, there's something. That we've, that we've been missing. Long lost love, I've yet to find you </segment1>
		<segment2>If that's you, if that's you we will know. If that's you, if that's you we will go. Enjoy the show. You've got it figured out. We'll find our way back too. We'll find our way to you. And our hearts will shine like you </segment2>
		<segment3>Riots and violence!. thanks for the rainbow. but I'll make my own. Slow down my robot, let's end this, let's end this. This is more than a broken heart. Long lost love, I've yet to find you </segment3>
		<segment4>This is more than a broken heart    </segment4>
