		<segment1>She sends it home in a paper bag. She says thing change. Maybe it's me. She didn't take time. Time to slow down. She didn't take time. Time to let me catch up. You can't fix me up. You can't fix me up. This bleading heart. This bleading heart is broken. My innocence. My innocence. This bleading heart. My blead'n. Waiting here you seemed an hour. Waiting here you seemed an hour long. I'm waiting here you. This bleading heart is broken. My innocence. My innocence. This bleading heart. My blead'n. Waiting here you seemed an hour. Waiting here you seemed an hour long. She sends it home in a paper bag. She says thing change. Maybe it's me. You can't fix me up. You can't fix me up. This bleading heart. This bleading heart is broken. My innocence. My innocence. This bleading heart. My blead'n.    </segment1>
