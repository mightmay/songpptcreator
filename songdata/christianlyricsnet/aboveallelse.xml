		<segment1>Jesus, my passion in life is to know You. May all other goals bow down toThis journey of loving You more. Jesus, Youve showered Your goodness on me. Given Your gifts so freely. But theres one thing Im longing for. Hear my hearts cry. And my prayer for this life </segment1>
		<segment2>Above all else. Above all else. Above all else. Give me Yourself </segment2>
		<segment3>Savior, the more that I see Your beauty. The more that I glimpse Your glory. My heart is captured by You. Jesus, You are my greatest treasure. Nothing this world can offer. Could ever compare to You. So, hear my hearts cry. And my prayer for this life    </segment3>
