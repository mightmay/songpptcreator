		<segment1>When I need to talk to you. It's not what you say, It's what you do. Just like you don't even care. It's all those little things, ohhhh that get to me. Don't let them get to me. Ohhhh, get to me. Why can't we just have a little simple talk?. But you throw dirt in my face. Is our friendship that meaningless to you?. I'm done asking you to stay. It's all of those little things, ohhhh that get to me. Won't let them get to me. ohhhh, get to me.</segment1>
