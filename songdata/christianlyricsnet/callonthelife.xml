		<segment1>By your eyes i can see. By your eyes i've got vision all around. By your voice i can hear. By your voice all the fear comes crashing down. And like the light from above, whoa. I've seen the way i've been living underground. By your heart i can love, whoa. To make me feel like i'm never coming down</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm not living for the past. No, i'm not living for the memories. There's no use in looking back. There's nothing there to see</segment2>
		<segment3>There's no use in looking back. When i know there is nothing there to see. I'm not living for the past. Or for the memories</segment3>
		<segment4>By your hands i can hold. By your hands i can build this from the ground. By your thoughts i can feel. By your thoughts i can deal with all our sound</segment4>
		<segment5>Like the light from above, whoa. I've seen the way i've been living underground. By your heart i can love, whoa. To make me feel like i'm never coming down</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm not living for the past. No, i'm not living for the memories. There's no use in looking back. There's nothing there to see</segment6>
		<segment7>There's no use in looking back. When i know when there's nothing there to see. I'm not living for the past. Or for the memories</segment7>
		<segment8>Call on the life. Call on the life. Call on the life. Call on the life</segment8>
		<segment9>Call on the life (I'm not living for the past). Call on the life (No, i'm not living for the memories). Call on the life (There's no use in looking back). Call on The life (I know that there's nothing there to see)</segment9>
