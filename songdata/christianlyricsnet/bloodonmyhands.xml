		<segment1>Each crack of that whip was for my mistakes. Blood is on my hands. Each stumble up that hill was my step to take. Blood is on my hands. How do I say thanks for this</segment1>
		<segment2>In the cross, In the cross, be my glory ever. Till my ransomed soul shall find rest beyond the river</segment2>
		<segment3>Each tear that flowed was by my sorrow sown. Blood is on my hands. Each drop that was spilled, my debt fulfilled. His blood is on my hands. How can I say thanks for this</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus keep me near the cross. There a precious fountain. Free to all, a healing stream flows. from Calvary's mountain    </segment4>
