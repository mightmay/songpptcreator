		<segment1>pass me not o gently saviour. hear my humble cry. while on others thou art calling. do not pass me by. trusting only in thy merit. would i seek your face. heal my wounded broken spirit. save me by your grace. thou the spring of all my comfort. you are more than life to me. whom have i on earth besides thee. whom in heaven but thee. (chorus:). saviour sweet saviour. hear my humble cry. while on others thou art calling. do not pass me by. do not pass me by    </segment1>
