		<segment1>I have had enough, buying ashes with my love. I don't need this. I'm pursuing counterfeit. I'm worth so much more. than this. I don't need it. I don't need it</segment1>
		<segment2>My flag is turning white. I need Your hope tonight. For the first time. Surrender saved my life</segment2>
		<segment3>When will all this end?. Must I open up again?. I don't need this. Healing hurts a little more, but I'll be stronger than before. Yeah, I need this, I know I need this</segment3>
		<segment4>Keep my eyes focused, You are the long run. There's no time for giving up. We'll make it. We'll make it    </segment4>
