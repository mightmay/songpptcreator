		<segment1>You take my rights away. You take control, no stopping You. You take my rights away. I can take it. </segment1>
		<segment2>See me let it go. You are in control. Suffer as we grow. And we say - we say we don't want to. </segment2>
		<segment3>Holding nothing, You take everything. You're worth anything at all. Anything at all. </segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS (repeat)] </segment4>
		<segment5>You define me. with your identity. Lose my life in You. I can take - I'll take what it costs me. </segment5>
