		<segment1>The paddle is broken, the punishment. is served in full. The welts are faded. and pain still lingers. as it should. The lone receiver. of empty compliments. taken in. and bought in full. The lesson's hammered. the message has been. reinforced.</segment1>
		<segment2>You said there would not be. any reason. to fear this world. But you're the reason. you're the reason. I feel. broken, and branded, and burning with doubt.</segment2>
		<segment3>The welts are faded. and the pain still lingers. as it should.</segment3>
		<segment4>These things are dealt in increments. Constant, and laced with detriment. How dare you ever feign surprise. When all those fingers point inside. They're piercing you.</segment4>
		<segment5>You said there would not be. any reason. to fear this world. But you're the reason. you're the reason. I feel. broken, and branded, and burning with doubt.</segment5>
		<segment6>These things are dealt in increments.    </segment6>
