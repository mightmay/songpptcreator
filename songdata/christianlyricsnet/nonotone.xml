		<segment1>No better word than from Your lips. No perfect life than what You lived. No greater gift, no not one</segment1>
		<segment2>No brighter star has ever shined. No better hope for all mankind. No higher mind, no not one</segment2>
		<segment3>No one has ever known. This kind of love You've shown</segment3>
		<segment4>There has never been a greater love. Than Your son. No, Not one. And there will never be a name above. No, Not one</segment4>
		<segment5>With His life You have forgiven us. Hope has come. Hope has come. And there will never be a greater love. No, Not one</segment5>
		<segment6>No image true or sweeter frame. No simple word can match Your name. No greater fame. No not one</segment6>
		<segment7>No one has ever seen. The depth of Your majesty</segment7>
		<segment8>No greater call - You gave us all a reason to live. No greater love - You gave us all a reason to give. No greater life - You gave us all a reason to shine. No greater love - forever mine!    </segment8>
