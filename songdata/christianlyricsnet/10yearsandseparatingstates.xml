		<segment1>They're still building roads in the south. And we could see them all if we start driving now. And we'll do all our thinking out loud. And wait for daylight</segment1>
		<segment2>It was in a dream we were out at a lake. After ten years in seperating states. To drain your blood of the poison. You wait for daylight</segment2>
		<segment3>It's getting close now</segment3>
		<segment4>Well I felt that daylight. And you left me wanting more. Get me out of this empty town. Cause I feel it changing me</segment4>
		<segment5>There's a place off of State Street in mind. Where we spoke of Shinobi one night. And it got us to think about living our lives for what's right. To take all the things that we know. And run without letting them go. And do all our thinking out loud. And wait for daylight</segment5>
		<segment6>It's getting close now</segment6>
		<segment7>Well I felt that daylight. And you left me wanting more. Get me out of this empty town. And back to the ground</segment7>
		<segment8>Well I felt that daylight. And it broke down walls inside. Get me out of this broken town. Cause I feel a change..</segment8>
		<segment9>Daylight found you there. Drain your blood. And fill your lungs with air</segment9>
		<segment10>Well I felt that daylight. And you left me wanting more. Get me out of this empty town. And back to the ground</segment10>
		<segment11>Well I felt that daylight. And it broke down. It's breaking my walls down. It's draining my blood out. I feel it changing me    </segment11>
