		<segment1>Are there no shadows where you are?. I can see everything as day. Problems that you try to hide away. Pushing me aside (You're pushing me aside)</segment1>
		<segment2>Could the winter calm come twice?. Because your heart seems so cold tonight. Thirst for substance somehow isn't right. It's killing me inside (It's killing you inside). Killing me inside</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. If something isn't right. If something isn't right</segment3>
		<segment4>This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been</segment4>
		<segment5>This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodbye. This is where love ends</segment5>
		<segment6>Are you so naive to right and wrong. How could you watch innocence forgone. Does what we've done ever really belong?. It wasted me away (I feel so wasted away)</segment6>
		<segment7>God if you can hear me out alright. Please take these feelings for her inside. My chest hurts when I breathe tonight. It's wasting me away (You're wasting me away). You're wasting me away</segment7>
		<segment8>I don't wanna be where you are. I don't wanna be here even now. I don't wanna be by your side. If something isn't right. If something isn't right</segment8>
		<segment9>This is our last (This is our last)</segment9>
		<segment10>This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been</segment10>
		<segment11>This our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our goodbye. This is where love ends</segment11>
		<segment12>This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. Words have no meaning. When I've seen where you've been</segment12>
		<segment13>This is our last goodnight. Say what you will. Say all that you can. This is our last goodbye. This is where love ends    </segment13>
