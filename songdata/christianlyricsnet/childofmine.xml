		<segment1>You decided long ago. To let me into your deepest soul. You have given me a private place. Then somehow you let it fade away. I know you so well, and I can tell. When you've been hiding something from me. Just let it go, let my love flow;. Let it bring you release.</segment1>
		<segment2>I have come to breathe new life. Into the heart of a child of mine. I have come to give you peace. So lift your head and believe.</segment2>
		<segment3>You were made in a beautiful way;. Born to be holy and sure of your faith. Something inside you has led you astray. Now you're locked in a struggle, And it won't go away. I know you have been down on your knees. I saw you cryin' for mercy. Well, how can I help when you're still holdin' on. To somethin' more precious than me?</segment3>
		<segment4>I have come to breathe new life. Into the heart of a child of mine. I have come to lift you up, To set you free, so believe.</segment4>
		<segment5>It's all about total surrender, It's all about total surrender, It's all about total surrender, Givin' it up when the goin' gets tough, Givin' it up when the goin' gets rough. Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh.</segment5>
