		<segment1>The air up here, it seems so thin. Stars burn my eyes. The blood, it covers sin. Flip an old coin over. A new life begins and the old one is over. If I tore my heart out and I threw it on the floor, Would you even care?. Why can't you feel that I am real?. Could you be the one?. Guide me to the Son. The air down here, It seems so thick. Dirt in my life, You know it makes me sick. I ask fr water onceagain 'cause my thirsty soul. Should be clean again.    </segment1>
