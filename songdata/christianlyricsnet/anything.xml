		<segment1>Lassitude your demeanor. You go on getting leaner. As they dearly sell you anodynes and death. And youre restless. Have you knocked at all the doors?. And can you feel at all. Its all you can do to go on breathing?</segment1>
		<segment2>And I cant stand by</segment2>
		<segment3>I'd do anything, anything at all. To get you, wont forget you. On the other side. Over here</segment3>
		<segment4>Here, my friend, take some of mine. Its freely given. And will cost you everything you have. But drink, my cup runs over. Have you knocked at all the doors?. Have you knocked at all?. Its all you can do to go on waking</segment4>
		<segment5>And I cant stand by</segment5>
		<segment6>Id do anything, anything at all. To get you, wont forget you. On the other side. Over here its clearer. As your mirror shows    </segment6>
