		<segment1>He was given a thorn in his side. Was I given the same?. Around everycorner in this life. Lies are whispering. I follow what they say. </segment1>
		<segment2>As demons hide, I'll curse your name, And I'll say it to your face. WhenI've died and touched the flame, I'll know who I should blame. </segment2>
		<segment3>Theblankets of this leave me cold. Curse my thoughts and my eyes. Lookingback at all of this I know. Maybe I should of cried. Maybe I don'tmind. </segment3>
		<segment4>As demons hide, I'll curse your name, And I'll say it to your face. WhenI've died and touched the flame, I'll know who I should blame. </segment4>
		<segment5>You've got today, But you always say. That you'll change tomorrow. Good intentions fade. When you sit and say. that you'll change tomorrow. </segment5>
		<segment6>We have stolen blood running through. Our veins like a cancer. We havefound a cure and it's you, And we have found the answer. </segment6>
		<segment7>As demons lie, I speak your name, And I'll say it to your face. When I die, I'll saywith a smile. That you are the one to blame.     </segment7>
