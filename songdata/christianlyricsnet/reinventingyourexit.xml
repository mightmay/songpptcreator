		<segment1>It's 12th and Hidde on a Sunday. feeling like were gold. and were nothing short of invincible, invincible, invincible. It starts again. can you feel it. it takes your breath away. stop saying that were invincible. (it's round and round). you're uninviting, unrewarding. and i'm misiforming you. we all want to be somebody. right now were just looking for the exit. this is the way i would have done things. up against the wall. you've got me up against your wall. it's you and me on a monday. the lies that we told. this is were we both go numb now. you broke my heart again this time. your fading now you crossed the line. we all want to be somebody. right now were just looking for the exit. this is the way i would have done things. up against the wall. you've got me up against your wall. reaching out for a hand thats not there. but you're not there. this is the way i would have done things. up against the wall. up against your wall. this is the way we should have done. when were up against a wall. up against a wall    </segment1>
