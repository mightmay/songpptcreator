		<segment1>. Sometimes this world seems so cruel just as if there were no rules. I've added my fair share. I know. I wish I could take back the cruel things I've done, but I won't let it drag me down. I'm in this for the long run. I won't let the stupid things I've done n the past get in my way. Not just on my strength alone I've fought for so long. It will take more than that before I give up. I have seen strong and weak give up along the way, but that will not be the case for me. Not tomorrow. Not today. This world has shown me what it has to offer. Guilt, hate, anger, and fear controls so many lives. But I won't let it drag me down. I'm in this for the long run. I won't let the stupid things I've done in the past get in my way. Not just on my strength alone I've fought for so long. It will take more than that before I give up. You won't see me give up. But I won't let it drag me down. I'm in this for the long run. I won't let the stupid things I've done in the past get in my way. Not just on my strength alone I've fought for so long. It will take more than that before I give up. You won't see me give up.</segment1>
