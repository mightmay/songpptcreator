		<segment1>(verse). When he walks into the room. I have to wonder. what's behind those eyes of blue: A skeleton or two?</segment1>
		<segment2>When she walks into the door. I have to wonder what's in store. Her smile is painted thin. Now it's running down her chin</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). We go on in life ignoring. The pain before our eyes. The consequence is worth exploring. The wading of the tide. It's up to us to try--today</segment3>
		<segment4>(verse 2). People passing, their lives unfold. Stumbling under, heavy loads. Another grain of sand. Falling through your hand. When he walks into the room. I have to wonder. What's behind those eyes of blue: A skeleton or two?</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>(outro tag). Watching, Waiting, Contemplating. Should I do something. Or just let it go?. We go on in life.     </segment6>
