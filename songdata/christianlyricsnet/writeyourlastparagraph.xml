		<segment1>Where do minutes of the past go. When the hands of clocks have passed?. You ask Are you troubled much?. I say It's like when we were young</segment1>
		<segment2>Write your last paragraph. Memories of life. Oh oh oh. oh oh oh. Oh oh</segment2>
		<segment3>I've resolved not to insist. On whether I can weather this. Winter aged us like the paint. That gathers by the window pane     </segment3>
