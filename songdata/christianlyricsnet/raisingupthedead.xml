		<segment1>vs1. she just wanted someone to fight. it helped to make her feel alive. someone to hit, someone to love. who couldnt exist so high above</segment1>
		<segment2>ch. she is waiting for the day. when he comes to her to say. that he is not a voice in her head. hes raising up the dead</segment2>
		<segment3>vs2. shell drive her car into the lake. hoping she might see his face. if hes everywhere, then why not here. why navigate, why even steer</segment3>
		<segment4>ch</segment4>
		<segment5>bridge. alone under the stars. shes walking off the night. when you dont know where you are. following the light is not a choice</segment5>
		<segment6>ch. she is waiting for the day. when he comes to her to say. that he is not a voice in her head. hes not the father who fled. hes not the things that they said. hes raising up the dead    </segment6>
