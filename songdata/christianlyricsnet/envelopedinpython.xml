		<segment1>My pet, my pet-how fun you are. I trust you so much I even leave the cage door ajar. you'd never harm me, but just to be safe-I admire you from afar</segment1>
		<segment2>The coiling is fast. this time it's your last. your soul asphyxiated. final chance for escape terminated</segment2>
		<segment3>Enveloped in python. constriction complete</segment3>
		<segment4>So harmless-me the master-you the slave. I reach out to touch you-I'm getting so brave. You affect me but little-I still haven't changed. and to those who find me abrasive-it's you that's deranged</segment4>
		<segment5>The coiling is fast. this time it's your last. your soul asphyxiated. final chance for escape terminated</segment5>
		<segment6>Enveloped in python. constriction complete</segment6>
		<segment7>Indian recorder solo: Ted</segment7>
		<segment8>Enveloped in python. constriction complete. where dreams become nightmares. of total defeat</segment8>
		<segment9>Not just a white line or addiction of some kind. but entanglement with anger or to bitterness bind     </segment9>
