		<segment1>Does it ever catch your eye. Beauty divine. In an old man's tears. A little girl's smile. If it feels like a song. One that belongs to you. Stop making sense. Your weakest defense. Just quiet your mind. Let the world unwind. See we're not alone. He makes Himself known. In time, His own time </segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). So breathe. Life will surprise you. Just be. It's what the world denies you. You see. The truth is all around you. Believe </segment2>
		<segment3>We're not alone. He makes Himself known. In time, His own time </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). So breathe. Life will surprise you. Just be. It's what the world denies you. You see. The truth is all around you. Believe. Believe </segment4>
		<segment5>Does it ever catch your eye..     </segment5>
