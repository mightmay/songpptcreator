		<segment1>Don't believe a word they say. Read it in the papers everyday. Tell me what they really got to say. I'm here for you. Don't make a difference what they do. I'll never let 'em get to you. I'll always be the one that's loving you. You know I'll never ever leave your side. So don't believe the rumors or their lies </segment1>
		<segment2>This is who I am. Try to understand. I'm the only one who died for you. Take a look at me. Tell me you believe. This is who I am. This is who I am </segment2>
		<segment3>The whole world is watching me. Like a picture on a movie screen. On the cover of a magazine. All these lies make me wanna scream. But you gotta put your faith in me. If you love me gotta just believe. I'm giving you the very best of me. You know I'll never ever leave your side. So don't believe the rumors or their lies </segment3>
		<segment4>This is who I am. Try to understand. I'm the only one who died for you. Take a look at me. Tell me you believe. This is who I am. This is who I, this is who I, this is who I am </segment4>
		<segment5>This is who I am. Try to understand. I'm the only one who died for you. Take a look at me. Tell me you believe. This is who I am. This is who I am. Try to understand. I'm the only one who died for you. Take a look at me. Tell me you believe. This is who I am. This is who I am     </segment5>
