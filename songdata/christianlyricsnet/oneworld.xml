		<segment1>One time. One world. Two times. One love. Three times. Rewind. 'Cause I'm a dedicate this song to everyone of God's children</segment1>
		<segment2>Come as you are. Come just like you be. It's the bumps and curves of our history. But no block in the road that we can't traverse. And no wounds from the past that can't be nursed</segment2>
		<segment3>All hate gonna to dissipate from our fate. No check, together we got a checkmate. All hate gonna dissipate and fade away. To make room for a brand new day we got</segment3>
		<segment4>We got one world 'til its time to fly. So it's one love 'til we say goodbye. We got one world its enough to share. 'Til we're called home and we're caught up in the air we got </segment4>
		<segment5>One world. I'll look out for you, you look out for me. One world. Together we can be perfect harmony. One world. I'll look out for you, you look out for me. One world. And I'm a dedicate this song to everyone of God's children</segment5>
		<segment6>One world oughta be more than enough. And if its not, is God looking in pure disgust?. Wondering what the dilly with the silly I see?. When I made each of these in the image of me. Everyday is a chance for a new stance. Like every song is the beginning of a new dance. And everyone of us was made to reflect the light. And glorify the most high so bright we got</segment6>
		<segment7>You can come as you are. Love is yours. Love is ours. I am a witness. To sweet forgiveness. You will shine like a star. Burning bright where you are in our one world.     </segment7>
