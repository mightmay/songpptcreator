		<segment1>It was written in the stars. On the pages of my heart. Oh, that someday I would find. The love I feel for you tonight. On the ocean of our dreams. Like a prayer you came to me. And the longing that had been. Found its ending in your eyes. and I am missing you tonight</segment1>
		<segment2>I really want to see you. I really want to touch you. If only I could hold you in my arms again. I really want to reach you. Forever to be with you. If only I could hold youin my arms again</segment2>
		<segment3>Across the waves, across the sea. Separating you from me. Here's a promise and it's mine. I will love you for all time. I'm wishing you were here tonight    </segment3>
