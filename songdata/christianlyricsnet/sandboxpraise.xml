		<segment1>Bring it back with that bass line. And let me bust another one of my quetion rhymes. What ever happend to play in the. Little kids buildin' castels all they understood. Thinkin' but not too much about the box where they sat. Was their world and all that was in it was good. Playin' all day 'till the street light came on. And momma call you home for spaghettie and meat balls. say a little prayer adn a bath good night. Life so simple return to the next days. It was back to that sandbox praise. Sandbox praise. So dig your hands in the dirt. Children we play with that earth. On &amp; on &amp; on. The question again phrased a little differant. Whatever happened to my beutiful innocence. I can't remember when but it faded away. Got lost along the shuffle bout the 7th grade. Never know why or when or where it went. But I'd sure like to find a little bit of innocence. Soemtimes I have to stop and ask why. Thing always catchin' up with you and me 'till I die. Cuz you know they say what you reap you sow. Yet responsiblity I always seem to throw away in my faith. Got to get back to the memories    </segment1>
