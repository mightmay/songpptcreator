		<segment1>She wallows in her misery. What made her think that this would be. That this would be any different. From the first mistake she made. Still she dove without a care. For the second time around she'll pay</segment1>
		<segment2>And wallow in her misery. The first to fail the last to flee. She thought she'd figured out the answer. To some long forgotten page. From some long forgotten book. On how to get her own way</segment2>
		<segment3>I've tried and tried to tell her. It's not what you do. It's what you've done. With what you did. I've tried to tell her</segment3>
		<segment4>She wallows in her misery. A failure at failure she fails to see. That this overacted part. From this never-ending play. Is just her substitute. For reality anyway</segment4>
		<segment5>I've tried and tried to tell her. It's not what you do. It's what you've done. With what you did. I've tried to tell her.     </segment5>
