		<segment1>I can see you all in my dreams. I can pretend theres never an end to it. No mystery, cause no one can leave. I know, I know the truth. Theres always an end, but if you try this, I cant tell you if youll pass the test. It would be my guess, you would end up just like the rest. I didnt know you had troubles on your mind. They are also on mine. If I could be what I wanted to be, I tell you the truth, you wouldnt hear me. Id be sailing the seas, coconut trees. I know, I know the truth. Theres always an end, but if you try this, I cant tell you if youll pass the test. It would be my guess, you would end up just like the rest. I didnt know you had troubles on your mind. They are also on mine. They are always on mine.    </segment1>
