		<segment1>I am still locked in my sin, waiting for one person to save me from this world. I'm locked up in these chains of the world that is making me lose myself. Locked in chains, you set me free. It's always you that saves me from this, you'll never turn your back on me. Always giving me the same grace that you leave, to everyone who came before me. I am still locked in these chains breaking my will. just to say what I used to be. Locked in chains you set me free. Locked in chains, you set me free from this. Locked in chains, you set me free from myself    </segment1>
