		<segment1>
In the end we tend to think of how it began. I could never explain the picture it painted, and how it made me feel. Now the ceiling is in motion. The light centered and overlooked. You want to see me disappear? Well, so do I</segment1>
		<segment2>Such a quiet evaporation</segment2>
		<segment3>We're nothing but hollow vessels in search of what makes us alive. I never said this was my revolution when you looked me in the eye. Oh, how I've walked this white line so many times before. What a feeble attempt just to feel alive</segment3>
		<segment4>This is for you and your hopeless case. You would never leave me in your wish to fail every time. Every time I try</segment4>
		<segment5>So talk about it. At least it makes you feel something inside</segment5>
		<segment6>Who have I become. Oh God, everything all around me is crumbling at my feet</segment6>
		<segment7>I stare so delicate and ashamed. At the shell I've shed myself from</segment7>
		<segment8>In the eyes of my ghost. And I will never look back again.
