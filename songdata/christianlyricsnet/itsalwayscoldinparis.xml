		<segment1>Death to my will. Oh, can I fill this hole in my heart?. What will ever fill?. I've fallen way too far. I wanted only you. Tell me what we are when I'm hurting you and your hurting me. Andy why are we in love?. Nothing is ever new and we both can see that. Death to your will. Oh, can I fill this hole in your heart?. Swallow me as a pill and stand with me in the dark. Oh, I wanted only you. Winter has lasted to long. Oh, it's always cold here. We can't see right or wrong. Oh, it always snows dear. Winter has lasted to long. Oh, it's always cold here. We can't see right or wrong. Oh, it's always cold my dear. With crumbing, ripping, and failing, you'd think that we'd get the point. God and the devil are saying, &quot;The well has rejected your coins&quot;.     </segment1>
