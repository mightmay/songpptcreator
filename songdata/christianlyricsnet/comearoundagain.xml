		<segment1>Im all messed up and Im feelin down. Down so low I have bottomed out. In this cavern where my heart is found. Just know I am here when you come around again</segment1>
		<segment2>Youre my bone my blood in every circumstance. I cant shake you off you are in my glance. And though I try so hard sometimes against the flow. You know, I am here when you come around again</segment2>
		<segment3>Its the difference that makes the earth move. Under our feet. And frustration allows a heart to twist until it breaks. Its the difference that makes the earth move. Under our feet. And frustration allows a heart to twist until it breaks. And Im breaking for You</segment3>
