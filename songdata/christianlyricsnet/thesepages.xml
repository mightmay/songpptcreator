		<segment1>Go tell the world that there is nothing here to hide. It seems like everyone's been covering their eyes </segment1>
		<segment2>Words that You didn't say were haunting these pages. Faces You didn't make were all I was seeing. The way that they painted You wasn't a picture. of one in control - and I don't think they know who you are </segment2>
		<segment3>Build brackets around You so You can come out clean. We tried to give You limits that You didn't need </segment3>
		<segment4>You can order all this heartbreak. You don't need my permission to move. I wish they would just stop trying to filter You out. We've got nothing to prove.     </segment4>
