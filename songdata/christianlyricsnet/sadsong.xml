		<segment1>There's always music in my mind. Orchestrations for my life. Oh this symphony sometimes. Plays like a sad song, sad song. September morning on my couch. Trembling hand across my mouth. Watching life go down in flames. I sang a sad song, sad song</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Can you hear the old broken melody. Blowing through the trees of Eden. Out across the heart of all humanity. Such a sad song, sad song</segment2>
		<segment3>Now the sun sets on the sands. Bombs like rain spill over man. While orphans made of flags and steel. Cry out a sad song, sad song. . Repeat Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>I can see the Man of Sorrows through this pain. Broken body, bloodied face. He's crying out and making way. To end our sad song, sad song     </segment4>
