		<segment1>Promises shattered. Answers don't come. Friends say goodbye. Plans come undone. Dreams get crushed. Lies get told. Words can turn cruel. Hearts can grow cold</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. In a broken world where we cry to feel. Some hope that helps these hearts to heal. You're my strength, You're my refuge. In a broken world, Jesus I'm holding to You</segment2>
		<segment3>You make sense of the madness. And You make darkness flee. You bring such a calm. To the chaos in me. Show me life. Tell me truth. Day after day I keep running to You</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Long ago, we fell so far. Yet You came to where we are</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
