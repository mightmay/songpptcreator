		<segment1>Here in this world that you've designed. From the rolling plains to the oceans. Deep and wide. Where are the words that can say what's. In my heart. All that I am is amazed by who you are</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: The one thing I desire. Is just to know you more. To live a life that moves and breathes. And loves to bring you joy. So fill me with a fire. That burns away my doubts and all my fears. Into a place where you are all I hear. It's the one thing I desire. To do what you require. Is the one thing I desire</segment2>
		<segment3>To love when I'd rather turn away. To give when I'm more resigned to take. To reach out a hand to someone who. Feels alone. The way you reached for me. When there seemed to be no hope</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll live my life serving Christ. Offering a sacrifice of praise</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat Chorus    </segment6>
