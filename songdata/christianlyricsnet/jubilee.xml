		<segment1>Theres a new day dawning now</segment1>
		<segment2>And a new song singing out.   . A river deep and wide.        . His love is all around.                       . His love is all around.                   . God is all around.        . Its a time of jubilee</segment2>
		<segment3>Young and old set free.        . And blind eyes now can see</segment3>
		<segment4>God is on the move.                       . God is on the move.                          . His love is on the move.     . It is time to live the life   .            . For Gods Church to shine for Christ.                . Tell the world of love beyond this flesh and blood.             . Oh its time to live the life  </segment4>
		<segment5>Ooooh oh, oh oh oooh (repeat).       . (So) Open up the windows of Heaven.                      . Let Your love shine through til the world knows You. Let Your love shine through til the world knows You     </segment5>
