		<segment1>i built another temple to a stranger. i gave away my heart to the rushing wind. i set my course to run right into danger. i sought the company of fools instead of friends</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: you know i've been unfaithful. with lovers in lines. while you're turning over tables. with the rage of a jealous kind. i chose the gallows to the aisle. thought that love would never find. hanging ropes will never keep you. and your love of a jealous kind. love of a jealous kind</segment2>
		<segment3>tryin' to jump away from rock that keeps on spreading. solace in the shift of the sinking sand. i'd rather feel the pain all too familiar. than be broken by a lover i don't understand. 'cause i don't understand</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>love of a jealous kind, yeah. love of a jealous kind. love of a jealous kind</segment5>
		<segment6>one hundred other lovers, more, one hundred other altars. if i should slow my pace and finally subject me to grace. and love that shames the wise. betrays the hearts deceit and lies. and breaks the back of foolish pride</segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS]</segment7>
		<segment8>love of a jealous kind. love of a jealous kind. love of a jealous kind    </segment8>
