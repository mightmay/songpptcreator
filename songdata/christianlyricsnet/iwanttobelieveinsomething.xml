		<segment1>Well I'm living with these old lies. And I'm stuck back here in yesterday. Keep your head up it'll get better. That's all I hear but I'm still drifting away</segment1>
		<segment2>I set my sail for winds of fortune. Well I'm sorry but there's no wind today. And my bodies feeling tired. I guess I'll kill myself and ease the pain</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I cannot take another moment. Do I just lay back be crucified?. I wanna believe in something. Man I feel like I'm just wasting away. I gotta believe in something. Oh... before I'm dead</segment3>
		<segment4>Man I've traveled every highway. And I just can't seem to find the one that's right. And I've burned that bridge behind me. I want my sanity, I just want my peace of mind. . Chorus.     </segment4>
