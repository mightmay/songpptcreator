		<segment1>Reach out. like a mountain i can't climb. like a river i can't cross. i beat my head against the wall. the obstacles before me are so tall. i'm trying to reach you. i'm trying to reach out. i'm trying to reach out. wanting to be with you. will i measure up?. what am i supposed to do?. i've never felt this way. these are my darkest days. i feel so far away. away!. a life of perfection. constant reflection of what i'll never be. smothered by your love. safe in your embrace. unending devotion. the memory of your face now i know. now i know me. so, i'm reaching out and i'm hold on. and i'm trying things i had left behind. reach out    </segment1>
