		<segment1>Fall out, fall through, fall apart. The endless cycle once I start. Plan B, Plan C, watch it go. And crumble into broken hopes</segment1>
		<segment2>All around I fall apart and can't you see I'm. All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm. All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm. All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm</segment2>
		<segment3>Mend it all, mend it all. Mend it all, mend it all. All I've torn, all I've run to the ground. Broken down, come mend it all</segment3>
		<segment4>Days are slipping through my hands. I'm holding on in sinking sand. And to make it worse, I've made a mess. Can you make any sense of this</segment4>
		<segment5>All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm. All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm. All around I'm all apart and can't you see I'm. Falling down, I'm falling apart and can't you see I'm</segment5>
		<segment6>Mend it all, mend it all. Mend it all, mend it all. All I've torn, all I've run to the ground. Broken down, come mend it all    </segment6>
