		<segment1>looks a lot like givin' up. peace will bring is a bitter cup. set our bodies down like offerings. while we pray to the god of the lesser things</segment1>
		<segment2>if the wind should shake this house apart. the cradle hits the ground with a broken heart. we will say we never knew a thing. while we pray to the god of the lesser things</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: is there grace for the wayward heart. is there grace for the wayward heart. grace, grace</segment3>
		<segment4>ash to ash and dust to dust. steel on steel or rain to rust. what mortal breath blood money brings. forth from the altar of the lesser things</segment4>
		<segment5>is there grace for the wayward heart</segment5>
		<segment6>is there grace for the wayward heart is there grace, grace</segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS x 2]    </segment7>
