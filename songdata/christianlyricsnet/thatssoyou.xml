		<segment1>It's a beautiful day. Now I'll be ok that you're not away. Yesterday was a terrible day. But now that you're here I'm ok. Cause you don't know how much I, I need you. Please don't go. You're so wonderful. This I swear, this I know</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. You, oh you, every single thing you do. I'm so proud of you. What you do. When you do the things you do. They're so you</segment2>
		<segment3>So thanks for your help. You shine so bright. You are the star that's in my sky. And I am yours and you are mine</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm so proud of you. That's so you    </segment5>
