		<segment1>So after all, you needed more than a death-threat fall. You needed more, and I let you fall. Into the coffin with your floor-dropped jaw. And I remember you aspiration, your dream to fit in. But it's gone, and they're here. So let's kill these felons now. </segment1>
		<segment2>But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home. But I remember you, when you stand there, You stand with your eyes closed. </segment2>
		<segment3>And I feel, tonight, that I let you die. But you could have lived forever, it took smiles to keep you alive. But heroes die, and so did mine. But you go, and I stay, will it keep you at peace now. </segment3>
		<segment4>But I remember you, you'll go, you'll find a way back home. But I remember you, when you stand there, You stand with your eyes closed. </segment4>
		<segment5>And I'll dig you out, and I'll sit you up. For the fools to find you, the fools breathe into you. </segment5>
		<segment6>So sleep child no one can touch you now. No one can hurt you now. Not here. Anymore.     </segment6>
