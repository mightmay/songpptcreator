		<segment1>sometimes i run but i'm not afraid. why must you bring up all mistakes i've made. she makes me smile. you come around. the wind in her hair reflects the sunset. i see you. make it seem like it was yesterday. but we've come a long way. out of the rain i search for answers. but still find nothing at all. why can't i. why must you say i've made a mess of things. i won't believe it. i feel like i'm dancing on air tonight. i'll make it right. i'll make it right. pull into another station and get more fuel. what will i do. sometimes i drive or ride with my eyes closed tight. cause if the skyline looks this way. then i don't want to sleep tonight. (never giving in always seeking light. we must always try try with all our might)    </segment1>
