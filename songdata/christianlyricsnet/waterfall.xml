		<segment1>Here I am dieing to say. I am desperate for your touch. I fall upon this desert ground and I am empty at your feet. Will you break me now. Will you take me in your grace</segment1>
		<segment2>Take me deeper in love. Take me deeper with you. Where the streams of your mercy run. Feel your waves over me. Feel your power over me. In the roar of your waterfall</segment2>
		<segment3>Wash away the hidden stains. Of my falleness I pray. Ill tell the world. Of all youve done. Of your saving power in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Saturate me now. Ever leave me in your grace    </segment4>
