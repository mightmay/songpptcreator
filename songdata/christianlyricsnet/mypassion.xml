		<segment1>I gaze into Your Glorious light. I know Youre with me day and night. And now I want to praise Your name</segment1>
		<segment2>Theres nothing else that I want more. Than just to look at You in awe. I sense Your Spirit set to move</segment2>
		<segment3>I know Your love it never ends. I know Your power gives me strength. I know somehow Ill never be the same</segment3>
		<segment4>Its Your grace. That brought me freedom to praise. And glorify Your Name. My passion is to worship You. It's Your love. A sacrifice to give eternal life. I praise You Lord. And Glorify Your name    </segment4>
