		<segment1>Here's a night, and it shines. And it calls us on and on. So be here by my side, and watch the stars. They're ours. Make a wish or just take charge. The moment comes get lost and go far. I think that we've got what it takes, to get this heart start beating again. So take it all the way. Whoa, whoa. And our hearts are on The Everglow. So just let go and fall into it. We begin, breathe in. Here's our chance to go for something. So this is where we win, and take the game. No blame. There's a neon light inside that shines. And tearing down the walls in the way. I think that we've got what it takes, to get this heart start beating again. So take it all the way. Whoa, whoa. And our hearts are on The Everglow. Deep inside we both know it. Everything's hanging on this moment. Whoa, whoa. And our hearts are on The Everglow. So just let go and fall into it. It's cold inside, but deep in the night. The light is bright enough to send the weakest ones to go for the ride in. Oh no you cannot fade away. Whoa, whoa. And our hearts are on The Everglow. Whoa, whoa. So just let go and fall into it. Whoa, whoa. And our hearts are on The Everglow. Deep inside we both know it. Everything's hanging on this moment. Whoa, whoa. And our hearts are on The Everglow. Every action makes a reaction. We'll figure it out and make it happen. Whoa, whoa. And our hearts are on The Everglow. So just let go and fall into it. </segment1>
