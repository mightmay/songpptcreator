		<segment1>This night should last forever. By myself but not alone. Reality will stab me</segment1>
		<segment2>Will i have the strength to carry on. Will i bow to the world. Will i be chained by my flesh. Will i bow to this world</segment2>
		<segment3>Without the help of something self. The pain of waking form a dream. I must believe. I think i saw your hands. I think i almost reached your outstretched arms. With the sun comes the fear. Lighting all things unseen. And wisping me away fro You. Why do i have to embrace the love of Christ     </segment3>
