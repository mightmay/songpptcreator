		<segment1>I scraped my knees while I was praying. And found a demon in my safest haven. Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything. Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna know what it'd be like. To find perfection in my pride. To see nothing in the light. I'll turn it off, in all my spite. In all my spite, I'll turn it off</segment2>
		<segment3>And the worst part is. Before it gets any better. We're headed for a cliff. And in the free fall. I will realize I'm better off. When I hit the bottom</segment3>
		<segment4>The tragedy, it seems unending. I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending. We're taking shortcuts and false solutions. Just to come out the hero</segment4>
		<segment5>Well, I can see behind the curtain. (I can see it now). The wheels are cranking, turning. It's all wrong, the way we're working. Towards a goal that's non-existent. It's not existent, but we just keep believing</segment5>
		<segment6>And the worst part is. Before it gets any better. We're headed for a cliff. And in the free fall. I will realize I'm better off. When I hit the bottom</segment6>
		<segment7>I wanna know what it'd be like. To find perfection in my pride. To see nothing in the light. I'll turn it off, in all my spite. In all my spite, I'll turn it off. Just turn it off. Again, again, again</segment7>
		<segment8>And the worst part is. Before it gets any better. We're headed for a cliff. And in the free fall. I will realize I'm better off. When I hit the bottom (x2)    </segment8>
