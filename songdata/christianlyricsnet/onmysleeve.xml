		<segment1>The eyes around me are so cold. With every chance they steal my soul. So walk with me, Talk with me, Hold my hand I'm stumbling. In consequence here is me alive </segment1>
		<segment2>Can you fix what's made to be broken. I can't fix what's made to be </segment2>
		<segment3>My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve. I'm not hiding. No. It only hurts to breathe </segment3>
		<segment4>My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve. I know it's blinding. No. It only hurts to breathe. Standing now and alone. I need answers tell me everything you know. So heavy is the night. Exhausted. Whispers tend to crucify my mind. I'm fighting but I'm blind </segment4>
		<segment5>Can you fix what's made to be broken. I can't fix what's made to be </segment5>
		<segment6>My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve </segment6>
		<segment7>I'm not hiding. No. It only hurts to breathe </segment7>
		<segment8>My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve. I know it's blinding. No. It only hurts, It only hurts, It only hurts to breathe. I shout out. Can you hear me?. Mistakes have cost me years. Do they cost you?. Are you like me?. Tell me - please.. </segment8>
		<segment9>My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve. I'm not hiding. No. It only hurts to breathe </segment9>
		<segment10>My Heart is tattooed on my sleeve. I know it's blinding. No. It only hurts, It only hurts, It only hurts to breathe    </segment10>
