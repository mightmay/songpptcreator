		<segment1>You dwell in the songs that we are singing. Rising to the Heavens, rising to Your heart, Your heart. Our praises filling up the spaces. In between and frailty and everything You are. You are the keeper of my heart</segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm restless, I'm restless. 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You. I'm restless, I'm restless. 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You. Oh God, I wanna rest in You</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, speak now for my soul is listening. Say that You have saved me, whisper in the dark. 'Cause I know You're more than my salvation. Without You I am hopeless, tell me who You are. You are the keeper of my heart. You are the keeper of my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>And I'm restless, I'm restless. 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You. I'm restless, I'm restless. 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You. I wanna rest in You</segment4>
		<segment5>Still my heart hold me close. Let me hear a still small voice. Let it grow, let it rise. Into a shout, into a cry</segment5>
		<segment6>Still my heart hold me close. Let me hear a still small voice. Let it grow, let it rise. Into a shout, into a cry</segment6>
		<segment7>And I'm restless, I'm restless. 'Til I rest in You, let me rest in You. I'm restless, so restless. 'Til I rest in You, 'til I rest in You. Oh God, I will rest in You    </segment7>
