		<segment1>Hello friend. It's me again. I'm feeling sad and. it's not the first time. I'm hearing that you do not care. I'm not buying it.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Too long to be free. I know your strong enough to see. Are you too weak to find the answers?. I'm feeling tension that's in the air. I'll take a breath and start all over. I'll do anything for you my friend. Our friendship seems to sometimes fade. Our closeness seems so far away. But that will change.    </segment2>
