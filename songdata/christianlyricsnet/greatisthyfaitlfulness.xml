		<segment1>Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;. There is no shadow of turning with Thee;. Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;. As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be.</segment1>
		<segment2>Refrain</segment2>
		<segment3>Great is Thy faithfulness!. Great is Thy faithfulness!. Morning by morning new mercies I see. All I have needed Thy hand hath provided;. Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me!</segment3>
		<segment4>Summer and winter and springtime and harvest, Sun, moon and stars in their courses above. Join with all nature in manifold witness. To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.</segment4>
		<segment5>Refrain</segment5>
		<segment6>Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth. Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide;. Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow, Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!</segment6>
