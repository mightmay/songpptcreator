He said now give me everything you got. Ill take that little bit and turn it to a lot. I don't care what they say or even what they thought. I can make a way even when they say there's not. But they said just for me to give up now. They said that I'm a be messed up now. They said there's no way to get love. I was better to drop out or just sell drugs. But he said I got a much better way. If I'd let him in and just let him change. If he got a chance He would take away. Everything from the past so I wanna say is..</segment2>

But he said I got a habit of taking. The least likely and then doing something amazing. And right at the point when he just came in. That's exactly what he did and I aint been the same since. They said now your poor white trash. With a broken home and a broken past. There's no way that your ever gonna last. Even if u did it and you make it then you'll fall apart fast. But he said that I can do anything. Ill take you places that your eyes never seen. Anything you face anything u need. I got it covered if you'll just trust in me </segment4>

		<segment6>Now you can just listen to. And follow after them and everything they do. You can just play the fool. And pay attention to what they telling you. Or you can hear what God is saying. Take a look around you can see God changing. Me from the inside out I'm not the same and. I hope it's convincing now I think its so amazing. They'll say that's not possible. They'll get mad and act all hostile. They don't want nothing to do just with the gospel. But that don't mean you gotta let it stop y'all. They call me 5 2 for the reason. The little that I had it was all he was needing. Five loaves and two fishes he was feeding. 10000 you finally get the meaning?</segment6>
