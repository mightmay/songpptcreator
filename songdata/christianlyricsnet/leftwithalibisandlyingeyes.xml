		<segment1>Watching someone stop breathing. Feel their arms and palms releasing. The color, the smell of the skin, All of this with your fingerprints. And there isn't a thing that they can do.</segment1>
		<segment2>Drive drive drive drive, I don't want to get caught. We'll say, we'll say we're innocent. And there is enough to prove we're not. They will believe anything. I'm packing all my clothes and never going to go home again. There isn't one thing we forgot. You'll see, we'll get away with this.</segment2>
		<segment3>My jeans, your shoes, we'll throw away everything we used. But there's still your worried mouth. To match your worried eyes. The only two things left to find.</segment3>
		<segment4>Drive drive drive drive, I don't want to get caught. We'll say, we'll say we're innocent. And there is enough to prove we're not. They will believe anything. I'm packing all my clothes and never going to go home again. There isn't one thing we forgot. You'll see, we'll get away with this.</segment4>
		<segment5>There's no compromise. So remember this. Your hands are lies. It's too late for riffs. We'll go home and close the door, then pull the sheets up to our heads and sleep. And there isn't a thing that they can do.</segment5>
		<segment6>Drive drive drive drive, I don't want to get caught. We'll say, we'll say we're innocent. And there is enough to prove we're not. They will believe anything. I'm packing all my clothes and never going to go home again. There isn't one thing we forgot. You'll see, we'll get away with this.     </segment6>
