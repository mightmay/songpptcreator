		<segment1>La dum da da dum. Take the cup of delusion. This empty hole inside. Drinks the wine of remorse. And giving cause to stumble. It's sobering, the changes</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). Don't turn around. Don't walk away. Don't try to lead. When you don't know</segment2>
		<segment3>La dum da da dum. Blotting out the stains of nonsense. And drenched in this desire. Spilling from an empty cup. You bury guilt like sin. Hurling smiles and judgments. The blatant tone of your soul. Creates a blackness deep within</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus 2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>Bitterness trickles through. This vein of tenderness</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus 4x)</segment6>
		<segment7>La dum la da dum. La dum la da dum. La dum la da dum    </segment7>
