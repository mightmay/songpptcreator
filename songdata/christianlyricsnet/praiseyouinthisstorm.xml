		<segment1>I was sure by now. That You would have reached down. And wiped our tears away. Stepped in and saved the day. But once again, I say &quot;Amen&quot;, and it's still raining</segment1>
		<segment2>As the thunder rolls. I barely hear You whisper through the rain. &quot;I'm with you&quot;. And as Your mercy falls. I raise my hands and praise the God who gives. And takes away</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I'll praise You in this storm. And I will lift my hands. For You are who You are. No matter where I am. Every tear I've cried. You hold in Your hand. You never left my side. And though my heart is torn. I will praise You in this storm</segment3>
		<segment4>I remember when. I stumbled in the wind. You heard my cry. You raised me up again. My strength is almost gone. How can I carry on. If I can't find You</segment4>
		<segment5>I lift my eyes unto the hills. Where does my help come from?. My help comes from the Lord. The maker of heaven and earth    </segment5>
