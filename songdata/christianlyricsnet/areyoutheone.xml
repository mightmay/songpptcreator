		<segment1>Somebody's gonna show him what love looks like. Telling what's wrong and right, are you the one?. Somebody's gonna teach him 'bout the birds and bees. Drinking bear and smoking thing, are you the one?</segment1>
		<segment2>Are you the one, that's what I ask myself. When I look at my boy, I can't help?. But wonder 'bout the world and all its danger. Are you the one, that's gonna have that talk. Where you turn red and you're self shot?. Or will you live it up to some stranger?</segment2>
		<segment3>Somebody is gonna reach him while he's young. Are you the one?</segment3>
		<segment4>Somebody's gonna be the one that she turns to. When she's hurt and she's confused, are you the one?. Somebody's gonna be the first to break her heart. Let her down and leave a scar, are you the one</segment4>
		<segment5>Are you the one, that's what I ask myself. When I look at my girl, yeah, I can't help?. But wonder 'bout the world and all its danger. Are you the one, that's gonna have that talk. Where she turns red and you're self shot?. Or will you live it up to some stranger?</segment5>
		<segment6>Somebody is gonna reach her while he's young</segment6>
		<segment7>Are you the one she will call when she's in trouble. The one who gets there on the double. When things ain't going right?. Are you the one? He wants to be like when he grows up. The one who always shows up. At his games and plays and every good day of his life?. Are you the one?</segment7>
		<segment8>Are you the one that teach him how to pray. And who to give their souls and take?. Will you live it up to some stranger?. Somebody's gonna reach him while they're young. Are you the one? Are you the one?    </segment8>
