		<segment1>will you watch the Potters hand. moving un and through the clay. a vessel not yet born. through His gift transform. into a thing of beauty</segment1>
		<segment2>do you love the way. a summer sunsets painted on the sky. oh how the eagle dances when he flies. and if you find youre silenced. by the beauty that surrounds us. wait until you meet the Artist</segment2>
		<segment3>you come from a secret place. where fear and wonder meet. woven together. in the image of our Maker. you are His masterpiece</segment3>
		<segment4>do you love to hear the poetry of a mothers lullaby. or the music in a newborn babies cry. and if you find youre humbled by the beauty that surrounds us. wait until you meet the Artist</segment4>
		<segment5>do you love the way. a summer sunsets painted on the sky. or the music in a newborn babies cry. and if you find youre humbled. by the beauty that surrounds us. wait until you meet the Artist    </segment5>
