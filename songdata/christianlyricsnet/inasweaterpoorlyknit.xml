		<segment1>In a sweater poorly knit and an unsuspecting smile , Little Moses drifts downstream in the Nile. A fumbling reply, an awkward rigid laugh, I'm carried helpless by my floating basket raft. Your flavor in my mind swings back and forth between. Sweeter than any wine and bitter as mustard greens, Light and dark as honeydew and pumpernickel bread --. The trap I set for you seems to have caught my leg instead! </segment1>
		<segment2>As you plow some other field try and forget my name, See what harvest yields, and, supposing I'd do the same, I planted rows of peas but by the first week of July. They should have come up to my knees, But they were maybe ankle high. Take the fingers from your flute to weave your colored yarns, And boil down your fruit to preserves in mason jars. But now the books are overdue and the goats are underfed --. The trap I set for you seems to have caught my leg instead! </segment2>
		<segment3>You're a door-without-a-key, a field-without-a-fence, You made a holy fool of me and I've thanked you ever since. If she comes circling back we'll end where we'd begun. Like two pennies on the train track the train crushed into one. Or if I'm a crown without a king, if I'm a broken open seed, If I come without a thing, then I come with all I need. No boat out in the blue, no place to rest your head --. The trap I set for you seems to have caught my leg instead! </segment3>
		<segment4>I. do. not. exist. only. YOU. exist    </segment4>
