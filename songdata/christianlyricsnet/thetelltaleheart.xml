		<segment1>I cut him up this evening. and when they came to check the scream. on the very spot I'd hidden him. I served a spot of tea</segment1>
		<segment2>I'd left no evidence. that anything was wrong. but the unnerving sound beneath the floor boards. reminded me of what I'd done</segment2>
		<segment3>I thought I'd committed. the perfect, fool-proof crime. I never knew how heavy. this would weigh upon my mind</segment3>
		<segment4>Things done in secret. under cover of night. have a funny way. of being brought into the light</segment4>
		<segment5>I admit the deed. can't you hear the beating. I admit the deed. I'm being driven mad by the Tell-Tale Heart.     </segment5>
