		<segment1>You think you know everything about me. I could tell you now everything I'm thinking. And I promise you that you wouldn't know a word. To think you didn't see you were all alone next to me . All alone</segment1>
		<segment2>Taking folding chairs up to the cathedral. Lying on the floor in a haunted church. Whining to the score that I couldn't need you more. If I fell into the sea you'd still be all alone next to me. still be all alone but next to me all alone</segment2>
		<segment3>And every time I try to figure out the end . I couldn't see. I'm getting closer as the sand becomes a friend. I couldn't be. Oh my God I never thought I would remember. That you're still here when I open up my eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>To think I didn't see you were all alone next to me. All alone    </segment4>
