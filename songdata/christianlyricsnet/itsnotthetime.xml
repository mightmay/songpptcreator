		<segment1>Chorus. It's not the time, it's not the place I am afraid (Repeat 3x). They keep telling me, I'm not alone. They're all standing by me, but I am not my own. This thing is growing like a cancer I must kill. I am so confused, I don't know what I feel. I refuse to believe this is a child. It's not a person yet it takes quite a while. And guilt is great on my shoulders tonight. Could someone please tell me what is wrong and what is right. What is wrong and what is right, what is wrong and what is right. But I know it's life, I can't deny that it's life. Oh is it life?Can I deny this it's life?I am afraid    </segment1>
