		<segment1>. [Verse 1:]. You can take my dry bones. Breathe life into this skin. You called me by name. Raised me to life again</segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse 2:]. You can calm the oceans. Speak peace into my soul. Take me as I am. Awaken my heart to beat again</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Alive in me</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 3:]. You move in the unseen. You set the captives free. As I stand and sing. You're breaking the chains off me</segment4>
		<segment5>[Bridge:]. Breathe in me Your life. I can feel You are close now. I can never hide. You are here and You know me. All I need is You. And I love You. I love You. I love You. I love You</segment5>
		<segment6>Breathe in me Your life. 'Til Your love overtakes me. Open up my eyes. Let me see You more clearly. Falling on my knees. 'Til I love like You love. Like You love me. I love You     </segment6>
