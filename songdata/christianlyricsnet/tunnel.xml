		<segment1>I won't pretend to know what you're thinking. I can't begin to know what you're going through. I won't deny the pain that you're feeling. But I'm gonna try and give a little hope to you</segment1>
		<segment2>Just remember what I've told you. There's so much you're living for</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a light at the end of this tunnel. There's a light at the end of this tunnel. For you, for you. There's a light at the end of this tunnel. Shinin' bright at the end of this tunnel. For you, for you. So keep holdin' on</segment3>
		<segment4>You've got your disappointments and sorrows. You ought to share the weight of that load with Me. Then you will find that the light of tomorrow. Brings a new life for your eyes to see</segment4>
		<segment5>So remember what I've told you. There's so much you're living for.     </segment5>
