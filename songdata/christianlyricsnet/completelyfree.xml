		<segment1>Broken and poured out for the love of His creation. God paid a debt that He didn't owe. Bearing my pain for not one was His equal. And wearing my shame so that I could know him</segment1>
		<segment2>He gave us all He had to give. So that we could truly live. So let's give all we have to Him. So that we can be completely free</segment2>
		<segment3>And as they placed the thorns on His brow. As they drove the nails into His hands and His feet. He looked past the moment. To where we are now. And gave us the victory. From what seemed His defeat</segment3>
		<segment4>He said here's my body. It's broken in two. Here is my blood let it cover you. All that I have is now yours to receive. Payment in full so that you could be free</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh without a doubt completely. So that we can be completely free    </segment5>
