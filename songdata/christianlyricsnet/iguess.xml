		<segment1>Me, me, myself, and I. I guess I'm scared you lied to me again. I guess foolish as I am. I have a weakness for you 'cause once you cared for me. We all know that you were hurting deep inside. We can't tell your life's regret is killing you. we never have the time to straighten out lines between you and I and if, if I saw you die. I'm scared I would not cry because of what you said to me. We all know that time is the only thing between us. We can't tell that only god can help us work it out.     </segment1>
