		<segment1> Remember the time when I thought of letting go and taking back my hand. When all I could think was how long can I follow you. and where do I stand in this world. And when I thought I couldn't go along, God I'm not that strong to walk through the valley with you. And though it still remains a mystery what you see in me. You come back for me every time</segment1>
		<segment2>Just like a soldier you battle for my soul. More like a Father you come and take me home</segment2>
		<segment3>What is the worth of a man living for himself with a heart of his own. He comes to your table with his hands reaching out to you. Father, wont you please give me more. God, I've come to see your heart for me. How it breaks for me. To witness a son fall away. So come and take me as you see me now. Jesus show me how you claimed me to be by your side</segment3>
		<segment4>Just like a soldier you battle for my soul. More like a Father you come and take me home</segment4>
		<segment5>You placed your spirit inside of me. A love more consuming than I thought it could be. And I'll take this love, this holiest flame. And give up this fight. Lord I remember, I remember</segment5>
		<segment6>Just like a soldier you battle for my soul. More like a Father you come and take me home    </segment6>
