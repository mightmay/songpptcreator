		<segment1>I close my eyes. And everything feels so right. Like a magic carpet ride. We fly away up high</segment1>
		<segment2>And never come back down. We'll keep this peace we found. And you're always there</segment2>
		<segment3>To love me when I'm feeling down. When no one else will come around. Every night you're always there. I need to know how much you care. You keep me hanging on and on. You keep me hanging on</segment3>
		<segment4>The sun will rise. And I'll open up my eyes. But it all looks the same. As it did yesterday</segment4>
		<segment5>And you're always there. To love me when I'm feeling down. When no one else will come around. Every night you're always there. I need to know how much you care. You keep me hanging on and on. You keep me hanging on</segment5>
		<segment6>I can't take anymore. Is this worth trying for. You keep me hanging on and on. You keep me hanging on    </segment6>
