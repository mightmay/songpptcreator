		<segment1>Verse 1: I'm in your corner, Don't worry 'bout a thing. And if you should ever need. Some comforting. I'm as close as the air you breathe, I'll be the faith you need to blieve. </segment1>
		<segment2>Put your head on my shoulder. And rest a little while, 'cause I'm here to hold you. When your world turns wild. That's just what love should do. When times are tough, I will pull you through. </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: When the hurricane blows. Against your heart. And the sky's on fire, And you don't know where you are, When you've done all you can do, And there's no one else to turn to. I will shelter you. </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: It doesn't matter. What tomorrow brings. 'cause baby together, We can weather anything. When you can't seem to. Find your way, I will push back the storm, I will stop the rain. </segment4>
		<segment5>No matter where you are. I will guide your heart.    </segment5>
