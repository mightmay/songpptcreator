		<segment1>See me, I play all your games better than you do. I see it as nothing new. What would you do?. I plan my life alone. Stumble through the unknown. I took your hand to find out your world was upside down. I thank you for all you gave to me and and forgive you for what you've done, but don't ever expect from me the stupid things you've done. I plan my life alone. Stumble through the unknown. I took your hand to find out your world was upside down. On a day. Then came to me, a promise of something new, a promise that you'd care for me. Love unconditional. Now as far as my life's concerned, it's all in perspective. The greatest gift you gave to me was turning my world upside down.    </segment1>
