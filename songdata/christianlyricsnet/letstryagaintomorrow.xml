		<segment1>Please don't be angry with me. I told you I was sorry. We better kiss and make up. Why do we fight so much?. There's got to be some better way to convince you to let me stay. Remember when we used to fall down laughing?. I know I'm hung up. I do repent and I promise I will never do it again.</segment1>
		<segment2>Staged fight. Goodnight. Let's try again tomorrow.</segment2>
		<segment3>Please don't be angry with me. I told you I was sorry. This always happens when I start to feel like I am something. I'd like to think that we could find our way around this mess. Remember when we used to fall down laughing. Why can't we shut up?. It's gunna make us. Don't you want to give it another shot?</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS 2X]. ..let's try again tomorrow. [CHORUS]    </segment4>
