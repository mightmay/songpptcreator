		<segment1>Dear Lord, this pain inside me. Tears me apart. And Lord the more it hurts. The harder my heart</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, in my darkest hour. Your love comes shining through. Your word is true and You make all things new. And I know You're all I need. You say You're here and You calm my fears. And i know You'll never leave</segment2>
		<segment3>Dear Lord, my heart is breaking. Breaking in two. And Lord my spirit's torn and. Crushed without You</segment3>
		<segment4>Higher than the stars  that shine. And deeper than the sea. Is my Savior's precious love. Your love has set me free. Set me free    </segment4>
