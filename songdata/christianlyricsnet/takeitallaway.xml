		<segment1>Youve stripped me down, the layers fall like rain. Its over now, just innocence and instinct still remain. You watched me while I slowly disappeared. I reached for you to save me; you were frozen in your fear</segment1>
		<segment2>Take it all away[x4]</segment2>
		<segment3>Circling the pain inside my soul. I reached inside your silence to steal what you wont show. I tried to find the answers in my fears. But what was found is lost again as soon as it appeared</segment3>
		<segment4>Take it all away [x4]</segment4>
		<segment5>Im breaking; I cant do this on my own. Can you hear me screaming out, am I all alone?</segment5>
		<segment6>You take away [x10]     </segment6>
