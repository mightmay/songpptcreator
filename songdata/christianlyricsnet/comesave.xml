		<segment1>Time is running out, come save. Death is creeping in, come save. We humble ourselves and seek Your face. Pour out Your mercy like rain</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. Your sons and your daughters cry for You. The waves of the waters reach for You. All of creation rises up and screams out Your name. Oh Lord, come save</segment2>
		<segment3>Addicted to our pride, come save. Consumed in self-delight, come save. Break us and free us from these chains. We desperately need Your grace</segment3>
		<segment4>[Repeat Chorus:]</segment4>
		<segment5>Come awaken us from our sleep. Come bring us to our knees. Come whisper truth in our ears. Come save</segment5>
		<segment6>[Repeat Chorus:]    </segment6>
