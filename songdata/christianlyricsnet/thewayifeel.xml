		<segment1>Lately I've been wandering. Off the narrow path. You've given me so many things that I've never had. And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through. If you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause I hate the way I feel tonight. And I know I need you in my life. Yes I hate the way I feel inside. And I promise to make the sacrifice </segment2>
		<segment3>The world I know is pulling me. More and more each day. I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray. Spiteful eyes are watching me. With everything I do. In the midst of darkness Lord. My spirit calls for you</segment3>
		<segment4>(You know sometimes deep inside). I feel like this    </segment4>
