		<segment1>Remember when. Remember you and me. In fields of blue and white. And I would never take it back. The stand-offs and the make-ups. On the bench. Our scene for hours and hours. And I would never take it back. And I would never take it back. For all the gold in the world</segment1>
		<segment2>On and on and on. She leads me. On and on, forever. Time will run back. On and on and on. She leads me. On and on, forever. And time will run back. And fetch the age of gold</segment2>
		<segment3>All that I have. To hold your hand in mine. And lose all sense of time. And I would never take it back. So close your eyes, I'll kiss you. And I'll hold you tightly until dawn. And I would never take it back. And I would never take it back. For all the gold in the world</segment3>
		<segment4>On and on and on. She leads me. On and on, forever. Time will run back. On and on and on. She leads me. On and on, forever. And time will run back. And fetch the age of gold</segment4>
		<segment5>Rmember when. Remember you and me in time</segment5>
		<segment6>On and on and on. She leads me. On and on, forever. Time will run back. On and on and on. She leads me. On and on, forever. And time will run back. And fetch the age of gold </segment6>
