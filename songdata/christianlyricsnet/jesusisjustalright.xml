		<segment1>Do do do dupe dupe. Do do do dupe. Do do do dupe dupem dupe dopem do. [Check it for me one time]. [Ohhhh, yeah yeah]</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Jesus is still alright with me. Jesus is still alright, oh yeah. Jesus is still alright with me. Jesus is still alright</segment2>
		<segment3>Toby Mac, and the Mac is back no slack. On a DC track that's jacked, beyond comprehension. I believe that I failed to mention that. There's a lack of recognition. When it comes to His position. Cause if Christ can't be crossed over, Then I'll keep my beat up nova</segment3>
		<segment4>(repeat chorus 1)</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus 2). I don't care what they may say. I don't care what they may do. I don't care what they may say. Jesus is still alright</segment5>
		<segment6>Back in place, and I'm all up in your face. With a rhyme that I embrace, like a mother to her child. I'm kickin' it Jesus style. To the ones that think they heard. I did use the &quot;J&quot; word. Cause I ain't too soft to say it. Even if DJ's don't play it</segment6>
		<segment7>do do do dupe dupem dupe dopem do (3x). Jesus is still alright. [Oh, I'm hopin' and I'm praying]</segment7>
		<segment8>Jesus is still alright. Jesus still alright, oh yeah. Jesus is still alright. Jesus is still alright. [oh yeah]</segment8>
		<segment9>(breakdown). Jesus is alright, I know He's alright. Jesus is alright, you know He's alright. Jesus is alright, we know He's alright. Jesus is alright, we know He's alright</segment9>
		<segment10>[Now we come to the pay off]</segment10>
		<segment11>I'm down with the one that is known as the Son. Of the G to the O to the D never done. With the flow, in the know, on the go like a pro. Not for show cause I ain't in the biz for the dough. Or the me, or the ray, all the dough's gotta stay, Cause I can't, no I can't, take it home anyway. Never trite when I write cause the Lord is my light. And His Word is my bond so ya know, He's alright</segment11>
		<segment12>(repeat choruses 1 and 2)</segment12>
		<segment13>[think about it..]    </segment13>
