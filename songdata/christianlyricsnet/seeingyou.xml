		<segment1>This is a time for seeing and singing. This is a time for breathing You in. And breathing out Your praise. Our hearts respond to Your revelation. All you are showing, all we have seen. Commands a life of praise</segment1>
		<segment2>No one can sing of things they have not seen. God, open our eyes towards a greater glimpse. The glory of You, the glory of You. God, open our eyes towards a greater glimpse</segment2>
		<segment3>Worship starts with seeing You. Worship starts with seeing You. Our hearts respond to Your revelation. Worship starts with seeing You. Worship starts with seeing You. Our hearts respond to Your revelation    </segment3>
