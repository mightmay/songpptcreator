		<segment1>Take up your bed and walk. You who have been sleeping. You whove been dead for so long. He will give you life. He offers you His heart. You could live forever. You have been down for so long. Take up your bed and walk. Little spirit You who were meant to be. His You whom the enemy stole from Through the sins of your Father and Mother. Little children. He wants you in His Kingdom But Hes The Perfect Gentleman. He waits for you to take His hand. Take up your bed and walk    </segment1>
