		<segment1>Awake from winters rest. Why cleave unto the dust?. From lower loves, desires, pursuits, and fears. Dont wait for passing moments. Im calling for you now. Im calling for you to come </segment1>
		<segment2>Rise up my love (rise up). My fair one, come away. Rise up my Love (my love). My fair one, come away </segment2>
		<segment3>Kindle sacred flames. Of love within my heart. My love I count you fair. This argument to rise. Dont wait for passing moments. Im calling for you now. Im calling for you to come    </segment3>
