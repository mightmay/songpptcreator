		<segment1>&quot;I'm here for you&quot; she said. and we can stay for awhile, my boyfriend's gone, we can just pretend. Lips that need no introduction. Now who's the greater sin, Your drab eyes seem to invite. (tell me darling) Where do we begin. </segment1>
		<segment2>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your kiss. Your calls. Your crutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your lips. Your lies. Your lust. Like the devils in your hands </segment2>
		<segment3>Everyone in this town. is seeing somebody else. Everybody's tired of someone. our eyes wander for help. Prayers that need no answer now. I'm tired of who I am. You were my greatest mistake. I fell in love with your sin. Your littlest sin </segment3>
		<segment4>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your kiss. Your calls. Your crutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your lips. Your lies. Your lust. Like the devils in your hands </segment4>
		<segment5>Failure is your disease. You want my outline drawn. You are my greatest failure. Discourse your saving song </segment5>
		<segment6>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your kiss. Your calls. Your crutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your lips. Your lies. Your lust. Like the devils in your hands </segment6>
		<segment7>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your kiss. Your calls. Your crutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your lips. Your lies. Your lust. Like the devils in your hands.     </segment7>
