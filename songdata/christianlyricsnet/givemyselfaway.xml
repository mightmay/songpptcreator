		<segment1>I can't stay here anymore. There's no time for me to hideaway. Waste another day. But you oh Lord I can't ignore. Or the chance to know that I can change. Before it's too late </segment1>
		<segment2>Here and now-I lay it all down. I take the road that leads to you. I won't look back, I won't turn around. I give myself away to you. Here and now-I lay it all down. I give myself away to you today </segment2>
		<segment3>It's a mystery to me. How I'm tempted by the lies that shine. Make me blind. I try to run-try to flee. From the sin that's had me hypnotized. I've realized </segment3>
		<segment4>Here and now-I lay it all down. I take the road that leads to you. I won't look back, I won't turn around. I give myself away to you. Here and now-I lay it all down. I give myself away to you today </segment4>
		<segment5>I can't stay here anymore. There's no time for me to hideaway </segment5>
		<segment6>Here and now-I lay it all down. I take the road that leads to you. I won't look back, I won't turn around. I give myself away to you. Here and now-I lay it all down. I give myself away to you today </segment6>
		<segment7>(repeat) </segment7>
		<segment8>I give myself away. I give myself away. I give myself away     </segment8>
