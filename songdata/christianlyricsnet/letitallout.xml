		<segment1>Let it all out (get it all out). Rip it out, remove it. Don't be alarmed when the wound begins to bleed. Cuz we're so scared to find out (what this life's all about). So scared we're gonna lose it. And knowing all along that's exactly what we need</segment1>
		<segment2>And today I'll trust you with the confidence. of a man who's never known defeat. But tomorrow upon hearing what I did, I'll stare at you in disbelief. Oh inconsistent me! ..crying out for consistency</segment2>
		<segment3>And You said, &quot;I know that this will hurt, but if I don't break your heart, things will just get worse. If the burden seems too much to bear, remember.. The end will justify the pain it took to get us there.&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>And I'll let it be known (times I have shown). Signs of all my weakness. But somewhere in me, there is strength</segment4>
		<segment5>And You'd promise me, that You believe. In time I will defeat this. 'cuz somewhere in me there is strength</segment5>
		<segment6>And today I'll trust you with the confidence. of a man who's never known defeat. I'll try my best to just forget that that man isn't me</segment6>
		<segment7>And You said, &quot;I know that this will hurt, but if I don't break your heart, things will just get worse. If the burden seems too much to bear, remember.. The end will justify the pain it took to get us there.&quot;</segment7>
		<segment8>Reach out to me, make my heart brand new. Every beat will be for You..for You..</segment8>
		<segment9>And you know, and you know. When You touched my heavy heart, you made it light.    </segment9>
