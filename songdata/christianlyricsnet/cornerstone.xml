		<segment1>All of the ground is sinking sand. A doubting maze of desert land. Where darkness rules the heart of man. Til the sun shines light on him</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord of all, Show youre strong. All my needs they fall</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Be a cornerstone. Be a cornerstone. Be a rock, higher than I. Be my fortress wall. Be a foundation for all, My cornerstone</segment3>
		<segment4>The buildings swaying in the wind. The towers crumble down again. This certainly will be the end. Of them not built on him</segment4>
		<segment5>Lord of all. Show your strong. All my needs they fall</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>You. You are the builder of my heart. You. Held me together from the start</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
