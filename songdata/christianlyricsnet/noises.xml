		<segment1>Oh do you remember me?. What are you doing here?. I've seen you in the past few weeks. Do you want a part of me?. It's the same same thing I don't wanna guess. Oh how do you feel?. Is it a waste of time trying to figure out?. Figure out what's fake and what is real</segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm just asking if you're just asking. Are you talking to me?. 'Cause I can't hear a thing but noises. Sweet noises</segment2>
		<segment3>Simpler watch all of us. And all of us will watch our tongues. And all these thoughts just wither to nothing. The right words, the right time will speak. It's the same same thing I don't wanna guess. Is it a waste of time trying to figure out</segment3>
		<segment4>And I'm just asking if you're just asking. Are you talking to me?. 'Cause I can't hear a thing but noises. Sweet noises</segment4>
		<segment5>And I'm just asking if you're just asking. Are you talking to me?. 'Cause I can't hear a thing but noises. Sweet noises</segment5>
		<segment6>It's your day. It's your time. I'm looking for you. And I won't lie</segment6>
		<segment7>And I'm just asking if you're just asking. It's your day. Are you talking to me?. 'Cause I can't hear a thing but noises. And I'm just asking if you're just asking. Sweet noises    </segment7>
