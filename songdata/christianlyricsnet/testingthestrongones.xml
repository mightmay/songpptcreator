		<segment1>There's an angel by your hospital bed desparate to hear his name on your breath. As he looks down you're not making a sound. Open your eyes and look at me. I'll bring to you whatever you need. I'll tell you I'm sorry that I can't take this pain away from you. I'd put it on my own body if I knew how to, can't you see?. I've got to bust you out of here somehow. I've never seen your heart this tired I've never seen your spirit held down. I know that you say, &quot;this is what you get for being a bad child.&quot;. But I know this will be your reward in just a little while. It's testing the strong ones. It's scarring the beautiful ones. It's holding the loved ones one last time.     </segment1>
