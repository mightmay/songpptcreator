		<segment1>Nobody can take my life away from me. Because I gave my life to you. No one can take my heart away. Because I gave my heart over to you. On the day that I found you. Nobody Can take my light away from me. Because my light shines just from you. No one can take my song away. Because i'm singin' a song that's new. Every day since I found you</segment1>
		<segment2>What can I do now they cry. Don't give your life away. Don't give your life away. One thing that I know. If I don't I will surely die</segment2>
		<segment3>Nobody, Nobody, nobody no one. can take my life away, my life away. Nobody, nobody, nobody no one. can take my life away, my life away</segment3>
		<segment4>I am built upon the Rock. That never changes. Never changes, never changes</segment4>
		<segment5>Nobody, nobody, nobody can ever take. my life no way. Nobody, nobody can ever take my. life away, my life away    </segment5>
