		<segment1>man is born depraved creates the great divide your paths been chosen for you before the sands of time your future you say is in your hands your foolishness brings nothing more than separation from the truth but you are satisfied lies are what you seemed to buy into to quench your thirst for something more that's why you've settled for so much less arms stretched wide to bridge the gap from righteousness to where you're at the paths that's chosen for you has now been realized are you satisfied you can't be satisfied.     </segment1>
