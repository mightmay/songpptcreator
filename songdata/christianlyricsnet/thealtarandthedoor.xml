		<segment1>Careless, I am reckless. I'm a wrong-way-travelin'-slowly-unraveling shell of a man. Burnt out, I'm so numb now. That the fire's just an ember way down in the corner of my cold, cold heart</segment1>
		<segment2>(Pre-Chorus). Lord, this time I'll make it right, here at the altar I lay my life. Your kingdom come but my will was done, my heart is broken as I..</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). Cry, like so many times before. But my eyes are dry before I leave the floor, oh Lord. I try but this time, Jesus, how can I be sure I will not lose my follow through. Between the altar and the door</segment3>
		<segment4>Here at the altar, oh my world so black and white. How could I ever falter. What You've shown me to be right</segment4>
		<segment5>(Pre-Chorus). (Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm trying so hard to stop trying so hard. Just let You be who You are. Lord, who You are in me. Jesus, I'm trying so hard to stop trying so hard. Just let You be who You are. Lord, who You are in me</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh Lord, I</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
