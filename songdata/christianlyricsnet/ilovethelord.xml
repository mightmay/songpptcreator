		<segment1> well I don't care what some may say. gonna stand up for the Lord today. well I don't care if they all know. gonna let the Lord's redeemed say so</segment1>
		<segment2>gonna say it loud - gonna say it proud. Hey! I, I love the Lord. I, I love the Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>come join the throng - ten million strong. come lift your voice and sing this victory song. gotta choose today whom you will serve. don't try to wait to find the nerve. the lines are drawn - no middle ground. don't you know you're either lost or found    </segment3>
