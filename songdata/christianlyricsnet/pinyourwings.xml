		<segment1>Hey Amanda. Where'd you find these crazy boys this time?. They say you're pretty but you don't think they're right.</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey Amanda. While you're staring at your telephone tonight. do you feel like turning it off, turning off all of the lights?</segment2>
		<segment3>Pin your wings down. if it's over now. Pin your wings down. just take a chance somehow</segment3>
		<segment4>Hey Amanda. who just threw your heart away this time?. And when you're crying on your bed does he help keep you alive?</segment4>
		<segment5>Pin your wings down. if it's all over now. Pin your wings down. just take a chance somehow</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll take the blame if you take me home now. Cuz there's no place left for trust in all this pain. And you know when it rains in this town I get washed away. Without a sound. So pin my wings down</segment6>
		<segment7>If it's over. If it's over now</segment7>
		<segment8>Pin your wings down. if it's over now. Pin your wings down. just take a chance somehow.     </segment8>
