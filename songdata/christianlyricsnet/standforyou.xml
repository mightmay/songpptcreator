		<segment1>So long politics its time to start being me. Take the chains off my lips its time to set my tongue free. Some might just turn their heads but some will raise a fist. And You told me to stand so I wont back down from this. They say there are no absolutes but are they absolutely sure?</segment1>
		<segment2>In a world that tries to water You down. Where beliefs cannot be spoken too loud. Ill stand for You. Where they claim Your way isnt wide enough. And they do their best just to cover You up. Ill stand for You</segment2>
		<segment3>Hello reality its time we embrace honesty. Teach me to speak with truth and love and with humility. You made a promise that Youre coming back to earth. Find More lyrics at www.sweetslyrics.com. So how selfish am I if I dont go tell the world. They say just be sincere. but could they all just be sincerely wrong?</segment3>
		<segment4>They might remove Your name from money. But You own it all the same. They kicked You out of school thats funny. Cause how could You go away?. In a land thats built upon Your word. Its amazing Youve been banned. To think that we control You is absurd. So for truth Im here to stand.     </segment4>
