		<segment1>Are you ready?. Take up your cross. Are you ready?. Take up your cross. You want to be used, But you call yourself... Yourself twice dead. Are you ready?. Take up your cross. Are you ready?. No more compromise, no more. Put down your pride, and accept, And accept the blood. We'll try, we'll try... But will you turn your head?. We'll try, we'll try... But will you?    </segment1>
