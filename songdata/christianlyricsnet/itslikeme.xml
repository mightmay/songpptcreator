		<segment1>My conversation is leading nowhere. And we talk of God but still I don't share. So many times that I just never saw the chance</segment1>
		<segment2>It's like me to never see. When it came, when it went. Now it's gone away. It's so like me to never see. When it came, when it went. Now it's gone away</segment2>
		<segment3>The phone rings with news that he's gone. Just the time I shared my heart was prepared and another soul was won. So much truth to tell, I am so glad I saw the chance</segment3>
		<segment4>It's like me to never see. When it came, when it went. Now it's gone away. It's so like me to never see. When it came, when it went. Now it's gone away. Sometimes I still never see when perfect opportunities come my way. Would my care increase if I truly believed that a life could be saved</segment4>
		<segment5>It's like me to never see. When it came, when it went. Now it's gone away. It's so like me to never see. When it came, when it went. Now it's gone away    </segment5>
