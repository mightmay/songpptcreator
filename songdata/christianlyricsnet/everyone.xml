		<segment1>Sometimes you trip and fall. Build a mountain on something small. And you know you cant catch your fall this time. Deep down beneath your bones. Does your heart beat. Is it made of stone. You cant ignore what you feel inside. Everyone you dont have to run. You dont have to find escape and wait for kingdom come. You dont have to run. No need to hide from grace. Just let love take you away. When lifes a Broadway show. With your best friends on the front row. Do you realize weve all read the lines. Stretched thin out in the cold. But love can melt your paper soul. You know we cant make it on our own    </segment1>
