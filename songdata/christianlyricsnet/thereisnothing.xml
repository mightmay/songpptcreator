		<segment1>Verse 1: Lord I come before You. To honor and adore You. For who You are and all that You have done. Lord I am not worthy. My heart is dark and dirty. Still somehow You bid for me to come</segment1>
		<segment2>Pre-Chorus: So clothe me in humility. Remind me, that I come before a King</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: And there is nothing. There is nothing. More precious, more worthy. May I gaze deeper. May I stand longer. May I press onward to know You Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: May our time be sweeter. May I be a keeper. Of the promises I make to You in song. Lord may I remember these moments of surrender. And live my life this way from this day on</segment4>
		<segment5>Pre-Chorus: So clothe me in humility. Remind me, that I come before a King</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: And there is nothing. There is nothing. More precious, more worthy. May I gaze deeper. May I stand longer. May I press onward to know You Lord</segment6>
		<segment7>Pre-Chorus: So clothe me in humility. Remind me.. that I come before a King</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus: And there is nothing. There is nothing. More precious, more worthy. May I gaze deeper. May I stand longer. May I press onward to know You Lord</segment8>
		<segment9>May I press onward to know You Lord    </segment9>
