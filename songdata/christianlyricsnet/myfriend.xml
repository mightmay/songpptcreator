		<segment1>We are standing at the crossroads. And now it's time. For you to go your way. And me to go mine. I will pray the Lord. Will keep you safe. Until the day I see your face again</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: My friend. We have been through so much. And you have been my Godsend. With your sure and steady love. My friend. You know I will be there. If you ever need. 'Cause you've always. Been a friend to me</segment2>
		<segment3>I may travel the world over. But one thing I know for sure. One day this road will lead me. Back 'round to your door. I will pray the Lord. Will keep you safe. Some bonds are just too strong. To break in the end</segment3>
		<segment4>[(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Nothing will change the way. I feel about you. Not the miles or the years. Or the place this life takes me to</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
