		<segment1>The mountains are high. The valleys are low. and you're confused on which way to go. I know there's someone who'll give you a hand. and lead you into the promised land</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Come on and take a free ride. Come on and get by my side. Come on and take a free ride </segment2>
		<segment3>All over the country I've seen it the same. Nobody's winning at this type of game. They got to do better they got to take aim. All of the answers are coming from Him </segment3>
		<segment4>Come on and take a free ride. Come on and get by my side. Come on and take a free ride </segment4>
		<segment5>Come on </segment5>
		<segment6>Come on and take a free ride. Come on and get by my side. Come on and take a free ride </segment6>
		<segment7>Come on and take a free ride (8x)    </segment7>
