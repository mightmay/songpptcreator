		<segment1>Independent. I leave you now, To drown in desolation, Oblivious to no one.</segment1>
		<segment2>Perpetual comparison, You realized when I left that you were done, You're done!</segment2>
		<segment3>Suffer!. 'cause this would be your fault. I know it's just another lie..</segment3>
		<segment4>You expect me to succumb, Snuff your insecurities. You bounce from friend to friend, You're nothing but a memory of treasure lost.</segment4>
		<segment5>We stumbled side by side, We all tried to ignore, The promises you never kept. You realized when I left that you were wrong, You're wrong!</segment5>
		<segment6>Suffer!. 'cause this would be your fault. I know it's just another lie..</segment6>
		<segment7>Come on.    </segment7>
