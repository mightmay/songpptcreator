		<segment1>Resurrection of a new life. Lavished in grace, with Christ he'll rise. My heart is swollen, and my eye shall weep. Laying my hands on him with tremblings. I feel the presence of whom I fear. Beyond the realms in which I dwell. Sensing submission of a new heart. My eyes flooded with tears. Another child awakening. (My eye shall weep).     </segment1>
