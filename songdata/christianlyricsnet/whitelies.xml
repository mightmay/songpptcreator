		<segment3>I'm doing my eyes right. I'm sleeping all through the night. But all of my thoughts are white. All of this can't be real. Real tonight, real tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>And it's all my fault. But that's what makes. the pieces of a normal man. I knew this all. But I didn't know enough. to know it comes from this</segment4>
		<segment5>All my fault (It's all my fault). But that's what makes the pieces of a normal man. I'm doing my eyes right, I knew this all. I'm sleeping all through the night. But I didn't know enough. to know it comes from this. But all of my thoughts are white. Real tonight, real tonight    </segment5>
