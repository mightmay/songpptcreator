		<segment1>There is no reason to run anymore. No reason to hide away. Since He's come into my life. He's brought sunshine to my day</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I will let my light shine. No more shadows. I will let my light shine. Darkness run away. I will let my light shine. For a bright tomorrow. I will let my light shine</segment2>
		<segment3>No more casting shadows. No more living lies. Since He's come into my life. He's brought sunshine to my skies</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus 2x)    </segment4>
