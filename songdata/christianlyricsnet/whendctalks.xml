		<segment5>When I talk, I talk about the Lord. You can be sure that you can't afford. To miss a lyric, a rhyming line. You know, they got meaning, they're right on time. Totally true and to the last letter. If it's Christian it ought to be better. Omit a bit, it should be the best. If it's of the King, you know it's blessed</segment5>
		<segment6>When DC talks. When DC talks. When DC talks. When DC talks</segment6>
		<segment7>D is for decent, I mean what I say. But obscene, I don't play that way. C is for Christ, to the I A N. That's right y'all, I am born again. Talk's my tool, my gift to use. R A P to spread the news of God. So you know the part now. Now tell the world what's on your heart</segment7>
