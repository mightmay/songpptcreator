		<segment1>Live and undrugged six years and countin'. Believer in Christ, yes, yes, the blessed fountain. Apologetic warrior, chalk one up for the visitors. Casting fiercesome light into the shadows of midnight. To the underground we descend. With our whole gereration to defend. Got a whole army on my case, got the devil in my face'cause that punk knows when's the end</segment1>
		<segment2>Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright the. Sight will blind the blind of this our modern time. Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright the. Sight will blind the blind of this our modern time.</segment2>
		<segment3>. O yeah, I got a beef with the fence-sitters. Tiers among the wheat, the cop-outs, the quitters. Cut from the branch fruitless, no good, Only one use and that's firewood. Pay no mind to the generation line. Forsake your sect and be color blind. The problem's not hollywood, the problem's not washington. The problem's a weak divided church of schizmed christians.</segment3>
		<segment4>Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright the. Sight will blind the blind of this our modern time. Unite, ignite and spark a light to burn so bright the. Sight will blind the blind of this our modern time.</segment4>
		<segment5>Never going back the the darkness I was damned in. Now I turn my back on the place that I was found in. Flick a match on babylon, burn baby burn. Raised my mind for all this time and now it's your turn. Got enough gasoline and plenty o' matches. Finally I'm free and I shake off the ashes. From the city of refuse, I refuse to pay dues. To you, not me, and none of the free and the few.     </segment5>
