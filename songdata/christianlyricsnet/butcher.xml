		<segment1>This man came to me he was looking for action. Pulling a blade to my neck. He said, Call me the butcher cause that's my trade. And you know that Ive come to collect.</segment1>
		<segment2>I said. Hit me now. and well see where it leads</segment2>
		<segment3>Cut me out. if you think I will bleed</segment3>
		<segment4>strike me down. If you think youre a man</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause I know that you don't understand..</segment5>
		<segment6>Because there is no weapon. There is no blade</segment6>
		<segment7>You wonder why Im not afraid?. Ive erased all of my fear of the grave. Youll never kill him that lives inside of me</segment7>
		<segment8>He looked into my eyes, all he saw was conviction. Dropping the blade to the earth. I said, How could you think that Id ever retreat?. You know that Im already dead.    </segment8>
