		<segment1>Is there anyone that fails?. Is there anyone that falls?. Am I the only one in church today feelin' so small?</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause when I take a look around. Everybody seems so strong. I know they'll soon discover. That I don't belong</segment2>
		<segment3>So I tuck it all away, like everything's ok. If I make them all believe it, maybe I'll believe it too. So with a painted grin, I'll play the part again. So everyone will see me the way that I see them</segment3>
		<segment4>Are happy plastic people. Under shiny plastic steeples. With walls around our weakness. And smiles that hide our pain. But if the invitations open. To every heart that's been broken. Maybe then we close the curtain on our stained glass masquerade</segment4>
		<segment5>Is there anyone who's been there?. Are there any hands to raise?. Am I the only one who's traded. In the altar for a stage?</segment5>
		<segment6>The performance is convincing. And we know every line by heart. Only when no one is watching. Can we really fall apart</segment6>
		<segment7>But would it set me free. If i dared to let you see. The truth behind the person. That you imagine me to be</segment7>
		<segment8>Would your arms be open. Or would you walk away. Would the love of Jesus. Be enough to make you stay?    </segment8>
