		<segment1>I have tried to follow, I have tried to lead. I have failed at everything. I have been the culprit to my selfish needs, made everything but You my King</segment1>
		<segment2>I couldn't be any less worthy. To spend one day much less forever with You</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus 1:). I lift my hands just as I am, I'm letting go of false control. I lift my voice, I have no choice. My life is Yours, use me for Your fame, Your fame</segment3>
		<segment4>I have not seen heaven, I haven't seen Your face. But I've seen Your Spirit move. And Jesus it's amazing the evidence of grace standing all around this room</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm merely a product of mercy. The target and victim of Your perfect love</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus 2:). I lift my hands just as I am, I'm letting go of false control. I lift my voice, I have no choice. My life is Yours, use me for Your fame, spreading like a flame</segment6>
		<segment7>Let every breath proclaim glory to Your name. You can't be contained and I'll never be the same</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus 1). (repeat twice)</segment8>
		<segment9>    </segment9>
