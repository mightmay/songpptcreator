		<segment1>A morning rainbow fills the sky, I think I'm dead. But I know I'm not dead yet. I've been missing You, You've been here all along. I guess sometimes I just forget. There was comfort in Your breath. You made me believe that life was worth it</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I'm a brand new man. I will never be the same. I'm a brand new man. I will never be the same</segment2>
		<segment3>I remember the day that I met You. The emptiness I had. Could fill a mountain. And I believed it was true, My pain would never go away. But there was comfort in Your breath, You made me believe that life was worth it.</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>And I'm not looking back. My past is far behind me, yeah. I'm stronger every day. You've made me a brand new man</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus).     </segment6>
