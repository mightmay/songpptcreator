		<segment1>Never thought it would be me. Living in a shattered dream. How could this be in for me?. What I wouldn't give to have. A life to live, a day to plan. Instead I'll be forever seventeen</segment1>
		<segment2>Could have lived out every dream. I could have been most anything</segment2>
		<segment3>Can someone wake me up?. I haven't lived yet. I'm only seventeen. God, did you forget?. I'm just a baby. And I don't wanna be. Forever seventeen</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll never have a bed to make. A test to take, a summer day. I'll always be forever seventeen. I could have had a family. If things had worked out differently. Instead I'll be forever seventeen</segment4>
		<segment5>Could I have just one more day. A chance to learn from my mistakes</segment5>
		<segment6>Can someone wake me up?. I haven't lived yet. I'm only seventeen. God, did you forget?. I'm just a baby. And I don't wanna be. Forever seventeen</segment6>
		<segment7>In a matter of a moment. Life fell before my eyes. And now I'm looking at the meaning of. The miracle of life. Where are we going without even knowing. The answers deep inside</segment7>
		<segment8>Forever seventeen</segment8>
		<segment9>So don't give up. You haven't lived yet. You're only seventeen. And God did not forget. You're just a baby    </segment9>
