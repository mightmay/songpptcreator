		<segment1>Paint me with Your purity. That Id attract Your majesty. When others boast in fame and gold. The purest place is where Ill go </segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). The purest place I will draw near. Do what it takes to keep me here. In the center of Your heart. The purest place is where You are </segment2>
		<segment3>Its not with masses, not with kings. Not in these songs or offerings. Not in this life or what it brings. The purest place is You my King </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>If theres such thing as too beautiful. If theres such thing as too wonderful. If theres such thing as too marvelous. Jesus its You, Jesus its You </segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus) </segment6>
		<segment7>Its You my King, Its You my King. The purest place, is You my King..     </segment7>
