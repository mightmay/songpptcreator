		<segment1>Take me as I am. Tell me where you stand. What you've done for me is more than I can tell. From a little seed. Tell me what you see. Make me needed</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm so excited. I can't hide it. And I'm so happy. When you are with me</segment2>
		<segment3>You took me as I was. Put me on higher ground. All you've done for me is more than I deserve. The reason why I live. The more and more you give. I'm so thankful</segment3>
		<segment4>We're here to rock. We dare not stop. The night is young. We've just begun    </segment4>
