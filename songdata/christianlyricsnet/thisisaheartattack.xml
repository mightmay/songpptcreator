		<segment1>Frost in the grass glitters. Dance in it barefoot for awhile. Until it hurts and I'll know it stings. Before turning numb. I guess you win and you lose some</segment1>
		<segment2>We're at war. Realize this is a heart attack. One nation under attack. Heart is frozen but it's ready to crack</segment2>
		<segment3>Frostbite biting slow. Turning blood and veins cold. Ice with claws climbing. Upwards my veins. But I will be searching. For a heart that won't get old</segment3>
		<segment4>We're at war. Realize this is a heart attack. One nation under attack. Heart is frozen but it's ready to crack.     </segment4>
