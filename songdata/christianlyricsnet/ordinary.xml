		<segment1>BRIDGE 1. Digging slowly, flowers growing. Beautiful from inside of me. Overlooking misrepresentation of my findings. Are we gonna come back to this?. How we ever gonna make a match to this?. Let's lay low like a mattress. They'll just be another one after this </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS 1. You could never stop this feelin'. I've got inside of me. And you could never fill these shoes. 'Cause I refuse to lose. I'm just ordinary me </segment2>
		<segment3>BRIDGE 1 </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS 1 </segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS 2. You could never stop this feelin'. I've got inside of me. I'm prepared to let this go. To let everybody know. I'm just ordinary </segment5>
		<segment6>Growin' up as an adolescent. So full of those questions. Got me second guessin'. My mind with the message. And the mention of my progression. Class is in session. How long will we all keep guessin?. When you've never been. It's so evident, from your grumbling. Man, I wonder when we'll talk. If you wanna talk. Take the mask off. We can rock. Shake it off, shake it off, shake it off </segment6>
		<segment7>BRIDGE 2. One! You can't make me feel this way. Two! You can't make me run away. Can't understand my chemistry. Laugh if that makes me ordinary </segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS 1. CHORUS 2 </segment8>
		<segment9>BRIDGE 2     </segment9>
