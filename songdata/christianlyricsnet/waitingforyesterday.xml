		<segment1>It's a long way back to reality, she puts another. Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago. Trying to figure out where things went wrong. Searching through all the lies she told. Somehow she missed out on all the things that. She needed most days spent wondering why this. Life is so cold and nothing ever changes</segment1>
		<segment2>Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal. Yesterday. Hiding all emotion far away</segment2>
		<segment3>Trying to find his self confidence, another. Broken heart behind the painless smile that he. Shows reminded that yesterday is so far gone. And tomorrow is still a miracle somehow he. Missed out on all the things he needed most days. Spent wondering why this life is so cruel and. Nothing ever changes</segment3>
		<segment4>Tomorrow's still a miracle    </segment4>
