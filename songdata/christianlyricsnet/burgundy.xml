		<segment1>Desperately waiting on something that's more than nothing. I've been here forever waiting just to see your hands. If you hear me cry, It's just something I'm always doing. Desperately waiting this wait, I hope it'll be over soon.</segment1>
		<segment2>Cry</segment2>
		<segment3>When you cried, when you died. When you told me you'd open my eyes. When you cried, when you died. When you told me you'd open my eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>Desperately waiting on something that's more than nothing. Burgundy blood pouring over my head, it's so warm. I've been here forever basking in this lonely river. I'm desperately waiting on you. I hope it'll be over soon.</segment4>
		<segment5>Cry</segment5>
		<segment6>When you cried, when you died. When you told me you'd open my eyes. When you cried, when you died. When you told me you'd open my eyes. I believed you.    </segment6>
