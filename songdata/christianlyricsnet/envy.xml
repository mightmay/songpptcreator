		<segment1>I watched you fade away, into a sea of taillights. My eyes still strained to this day.. Evidence of who we were, left here along the way. I see the truth in the tree.</segment1>
		<segment2>Ill free you, fall away. Ill free you, fade away. (x 2)</segment2>
		<segment3>The world just stopped its pull, and I could almost hear you, crying out through the noise.. The things I thought I knew, so close to understanding. But now Im dumb to the wise.</segment3>
		<segment4>Ill free you, fall away. Ill free you, fade away. (x 2)</segment4>
		<segment5>I see her, perfectly clothed in white..my eyes burn..</segment5>
		<segment6>Ill free you, fall away. Ill free you, fade away. (x 2)    </segment6>
