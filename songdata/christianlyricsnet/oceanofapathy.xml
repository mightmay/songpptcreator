		<segment1>Go.. Everything looks the same. It's all so watered down. Where does our anchor lie?. Where does our anchor lie?. Yeah.. There's no identity in other's insecurities. We're told everything will be alright. Hush up, sit tight while sold a science and proved what's impossible.. what's impossible. Hush up, sit tight while sold a science and proved what's impossible. Hold up. Hold on. Let's go. It might really hurt this time. Hold up. Hold on. Let's go. It might really hurt this time. Hold on... Hold up. Hold on. Let's go. It might really hurt this time. Let's go. Why are we led by a misled generation?. Everything true and complete is cut out.. Everything true and complete is cut out, and swept under the floor boards, left to drown.. left to drown in an.. ocean.. ocean.. ocean.. of apathy. We can fight the current, but we can't climb the waterfall.. Why are we led by a misled generation, left to drown in an ocean.. ocean.. ocean.. of apathy?. Ocean.. ocean.. ocean.. of apathy?    </segment1>
