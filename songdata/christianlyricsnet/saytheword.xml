		<segment1>I had months to write a song. That captured who you are. But I fear I have done you wrong. Because I've failed you so far. The chord that struck, an angel fell. The sky went dark and it all comes down. The choices made, the lies forgotten. Oh, well</segment1>
		<segment2>This is the way that I know. This is the way that I know. I would give everything for some hope. Are you different, could I be different too?. Nobody knows you, nobody knows you like I do</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a song outside my window. And it plays to your tune. And there's a life inside this pencil. And it lives for what is true. Cause I am lost for words, the cost for her. Was way to much to bear. You're not perfect, but I don't care</segment3>
		<segment4>This is the way that I know. This is the way that I know. I would give everything for some hope. Are you different, could I be different too?. Nobody knows you, nobody knows you like I do</segment4>
		<segment5>Are you different, could I be different too?. Nobody knows you, nobody knows you like I do</segment5>
		<segment6>Say the word, say the word. Are you different, could I be different too?. Nobody knows you, nobody knows you like I do</segment6>
		<segment7>Yeah, woah</segment7>
		<segment8>Are you different, could I be different too?. Nobody knows you, nobody knows you like I do. Are you different, could I be different too?. Nobody knows you, nobody knows you like I do    </segment8>
