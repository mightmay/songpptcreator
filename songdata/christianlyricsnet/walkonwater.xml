		<segment1>Simon Peter won't you put those nets down. follow me I'll lead you out of this town. to a place where no boat has ever been. I will make you a fisher of men </segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus walked out on the water. said take courage it is me. Peter trusted and he wanted to go farther. so he stepped out on the sea </segment2>
		<segment3>If I keep my eyes on Jesus I can walk on water. If I keep my eyes on Jesus I can walk on water </segment3>
		<segment4>Just like peter I want to go farther. tread on the sea and walk on the water. step where he steps and go where he goes. side by side when the sea billows roll. I'll be alright when the wind comes. I'll be alright when the waves come crashing. I'm not afraid for this is my father's world     </segment4>
