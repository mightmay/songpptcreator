		<segment1>You enter the room. Darkness is all you see. Then crouch on the floor. Say to yourself &quot;When will I wake from this dream?&quot;. The silence scares you straight. Broken hope. You say back to yourself &quot;How will I get out of this mess?&quot;. I wish it would end. It just now begins. Stuck in a rut. Spinning around. Insanity at its peak from the sound as your hope falls to the ground. Falling down. Falling down.    </segment1>
