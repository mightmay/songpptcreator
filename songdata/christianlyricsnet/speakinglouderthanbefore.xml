		<segment1>erse 1: Hear now this Declaration from out across the nation, we need to wake up and understand. Many hurting hearts are crying, but our voices seem to be dying, can you see this battle raging on?</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: We are the light to reach this world, we are the salt preserving these souls. lets show them all the love that we've received. We are, we are in desperation. we need to reach this generation, we are speaking louder than before. we are the hope that's been forgotten, we have a love that has been brought &amp; we are speaking louder than before.</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Take every chance that you can, move together, taking a stand, never losing heart, we'll speak as one. We need to be the image of Christ, to show love and serve at all times. we can make a difference in this land.</segment3>
		<segment4>Everything's surreal, but this urgency I fell, we should be reaching out to all these desperate pleas, the need is real, can't you feel this call to revolution?. My beating heart is breaking for them. that's why I am speaking up, that's why I am speaking now.     </segment4>
