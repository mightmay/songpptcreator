		<segment1>don't you know you are my everything. and don't you know you make my heart sing. you've turned my world inside out. now i know what life is about. and it's you i can't live without. you say for now just let me be. you say for now i will be beat. you cry inside and you die inside. i stand by and watch it all go by. i hope for you. and i'll wait until you smile and you make my heart stand still. but, the wait is long. will it ever end?. the pain and suffering of my best friend. you destroy yourself by a single thought. spiraling downward now you've been caught. you come up for air. and then you'll see how much you're loved. and how sweet life can be. don't you know you are my everything. and don't you know you make my heart sing. you've turned my world inside out. now i know what life's about. and its you i can't live without. but, i'll try to just get by for now. and i'll walk on by for now    </segment1>
