		<segment1>Verse 1: I don't watch sad re-runs. I wanna feel the new day that comes. And If I make mistakes, oh well, that's alright. I'd rather fall and take the sting. Then let somebody clip my wings. I know eventually. I'll learn to fly, ya ya </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I see the world how it could it be. Dreaming in color. It looks so beautiful to me. Dreaming in color. In reds and blues a thousands hues. Coming in clear and bright. We don't have to live in black and white. Dreaming in color. Na na na na na na na na.. </segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: When everything is looking gray. And nothings really going my way. Everyvbody tells me that I shoot too high. I don't let it shake me, no no. There's a secret place that I go. All I have to do is stop. And I close my eyes, ya ya </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: I see the world how it could it be. Dreaming in color. It looks so beautiful to me. Dreaming in color. In reds and blues a thousands hues. Coming in clear and bright. We don't have to live in black and white. Dreaming in color. Na na na na na na na na.. </segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: Is there to touch. Is there to feel. The world I've been dreaming of. One day I will make it real </segment5>
		<segment6>I see the world how it could it be. Ya ya. And I close my eyes.. ya ya ya </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus: I see the world how it could it be. Dreaming in color. It looks so beautiful to me. Dreaming in color. In reds and blues a thousands hues. Coming in clear and bright. We don't have to live in black and white. Dreaming in color. Na na na na na na na na..     </segment7>
