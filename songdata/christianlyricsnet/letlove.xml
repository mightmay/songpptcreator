		<segment1>Love lets love forgets. we don't need a world of regrets. so let's love. Let's love one another. let's give love to the other. Black or white, young or old. everybody needs a little love to hold </segment1>
		<segment2>Love is my light that lets me see. love is my key that sets me free. Love is right, love is good. give it out, I know I should. Love was shed on a tree. look out world, Calvary. I am glad I'm a victim of love </segment2>
		<segment3>Let love, linger over Tokyo. let love, soak down through Idaho. Let love, stay like a Port-de-Pax. Let love, let love </segment3>
		<segment4>Love never envies, love never boasts. giving out love you get the most. Let love, let love. let love go, let it flow. Let it come out of you. and let it show, love </segment4>
		<segment5>Let love, linger over Tokyo. let love, soak down through Idaho. Let love, stay like a Port-de-Pax. Let love, let love </segment5>
		<segment6>Let's love one another. let's give love to the other </segment6>
		<segment7>Let love, linger over Tokyo. let love, soak down through Idaho. Let love, stay like a Port-de-Pax. Let love, let love.     </segment7>
