		<segment1>I couldn't find myself today. I got lost in reflection. Retracing steps all along the way. Back to days with no direction. I wasn't wishing for those times to come again. No it was more of a reminder. Of where and what and how I'd been. Living my life without connection. To the One who'd always seen within. Who knew my heart and its intentions. He said that all could be forgiven. If I could trust in One Who'd risen. And that's when His mercy came to me</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I was saved by the Mercy Man. He touched me heart. He helped me understand. That there was shelter and unfailing love. If i'd just take the hand. Hand of the Mercy Man</segment2>
		<segment3>All these expectations. That I'd placed upon myself. How I would conquer the giants. With the help of no one else. But I was wrong - I was mistaken. What I thought was the truth. Was not the truth at all. And that's when I heard Mercy call</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus 2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>But I was wrong - I was mistaken. What I thought was the truth. Was not the truth at all</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus 2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>He took my hand. Holds my heart. The Mercy Man.     </segment7>
