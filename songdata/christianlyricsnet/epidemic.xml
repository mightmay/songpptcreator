		<segment1>Is it such a crime to be a paradigm. So many people have to think it's just a waste of time. But the truth is, the truth is a lie. It's a sign of the changing times. Kinda feelin' like it's time for me to climb, me to rhyme. While I'm fightin' for the lost in the meantime. I don't be goin' at it part time lookin' for the prime time. People have to think it's just a pastime</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>We're in the middle of an outbreak. It's no joke it's. Well there's an epidemic goin' on. So be wise and decide to change</segment3>
		<segment4>It's a hard concept to grasp when you're playing with fire. And you keep throwin' on gas eventually you'll get burned with a big blast. We stand fast withstanding the whiplash we make it last. And raise our colors to the top of the mast. Because the sands filling fast in the hourglass. So unmask and forget your past stay on path. The world's labeled you as an outcast. Well here's a newsflash you'll never see teeth gnash</segment4>
		<segment5>Outbreak. I feel what's real in my mind inside</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>You can't escape what seeks you out. There's an epidemic going on    </segment7>
