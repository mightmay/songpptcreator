		<segment1>Have you ever seen a man stumbled and fallen. All due to his pride. I don't want to be another one. Fallen due to my pride </segment1>
		<segment2>Take my pride away. Pride away. Take my pride away. Pride away. Take my pride away </segment2>
		<segment3>Lord keep me only focused on You. Make me a humble man. Don't ever let me take the credit. For all that you have done </segment3>
		<segment4>Take my pride away. Pride away. Take my pride away. Pride away. Take my pride away </segment4>
		<segment5>Standing here amidst this point of definition. Pushing for position as I battle opposition. Am I on a mission or is it all in vain. Do you notice the difference or is it all the same. And who do I blame when my vision gets blurry I. Get in a hurry frusterated and feeling fury. Faith is enduring to stand the test of time. Answers are plain we make them hard to define. But pull from divine when problems arise. But pride denies and my stand never survives. In every one of our lives in every single day. We need to lay down our pride as GodP takes it away </segment5>
		<segment6>Take my pride away. Pride away. Take my pride away. Pride away. Take my pride away    </segment6>
