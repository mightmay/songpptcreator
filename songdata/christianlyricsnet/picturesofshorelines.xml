		<segment1>If you insist on pictures of shorelines. then i insist on pages of your lines meant for me, to be sent to me. </segment1>
		<segment2>Remember watching the storms from the lifeguard stand. Remember feeling the tingling in my fingertips. when I touched your lips. </segment2>
		<segment3>And I recall how you sat on the same side of me, it always seemed that you'd always be on my side. You're my best side. </segment3>
		<segment4>And it's early June, so the sand's still dry, and you have got the boldest eyes, and I can't help but think it's right, that inside you it's me I'll find. And I'm still waiting. </segment4>
		<segment5>And it's early June, so the sand's still dry, and the storm off shore is not far behind. And I'm still waiting. </segment5>
		<segment6>And sometimes you don't say a thing for a long while. And the ships off shore hold stories that we'd make. And sometimes we are held at bay by these miles. But less of you is more than I can take. </segment6>
		<segment7>And the moments that we've shared could last a lifetime. And the faith I have in us will keep you near. And several of these miles placed in between us. mean several of these words being sent by mail. I hope this letter finds you well.     </segment7>
