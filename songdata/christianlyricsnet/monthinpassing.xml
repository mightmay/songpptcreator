		<segment1>my friend. the flower taking flight. on end of any open field alight. tell me the shadows standing still. miss me just say that you will. a month in passing never noticed you. a month of passing time in solitude. while at the base of yet another day, it's ok. another month is standing in the way. my friend. like a needle stick your stem. the skin of mother earth to prick. it bleeds the blood of second thought. indeed, regret slows the clot. a silver start, a solitary dime. could take apart, disarm this. with a minute of your time, my friend    </segment1>
