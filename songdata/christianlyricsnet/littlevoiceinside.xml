		<segment1>Father do you hear me. 'Cause I know I hear you. I waited for the answers. While sittin' here in my room. I danced to the rhythm. And moved by myself. No one could see through me. Or hear the words I felt</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Little voice inside keeps calling. Little voice inside it cries. Little voice inside keeps calling. Little voice - oh won't you be my guide</segment2>
		<segment3>I sometimes hear the echo. The pattern of my cry. I sometimes feel the pulling. From a sound that's deep inside. Quiet are the whispers. And silent are my eyes. No one hears but me. That little voice inside, you see.    </segment3>
