		<segment1>Stop what you're doing. I don't think it's becoming of you. To treat your friends like that. And all you've been saying. Man it's driving me right up the wall. I don't think I'm down with that</segment1>
		<segment2>And what you gonna say when you're alone. And where are gonna turn when there aint nowhere left to go. Well I think. This is a condition. That you're living in. You've been living in. And this is a condition. That you're living in. And you won't win so. Turn it off and start it up again</segment2>
		<segment3>And now you're just fading. You're not quite the person that you were. Back then when we'd hang out. And man you've been changing. I don't think I even recognize. This person you are now</segment3>
		<segment4>And I don't mean for this to bring you down. I'd like to think you'd hear this song and turn it all around. But I know. This is a condition. That you're living in. You've been living in. And this is a condition. That you're living in. And you won't win so. Turn it off and start it up again. Start it up again. Start it up again. Start it up again</segment4>
		<segment5>It takes a sea of change. That I cannot explain. I can't wait for it to come. Cause you'll just end up numb to it     </segment5>
