		<segment1>You were a star in the sky. Over the sinking sun. Of all the voices that cried, You were the only one. Telling us what we should hear, Trust of friends through the years -. Is this the night of your return? </segment1>
		<segment2>There is a house on the hill. Where all your old friends wait. Softly the firelight spills. Out to the stony gate -. Voices from inside the door. Calling you back to the shore, Out of the night of your return. </segment2>
		<segment3>We wait for you. We wait for you. Is this the night of your return? </segment3>
		<segment4>You know the evening by name, Drawn to the secretive, Still, we are one and the same -. We have our weaknesses. So many things we would say, But we will wait until day, This is the night of your return. </segment4>
		<segment5>We wait for you. We wait for you. This is the night of your return.    </segment5>
