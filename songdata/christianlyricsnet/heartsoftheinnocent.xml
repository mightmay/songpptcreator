		<segment1>I'm looking down into the eyes of hopelessness. They're crying out to me. I see the pain it's so much more than youth should know. It tears me apart. What can I do to change what I see. This vicious cycle must come to an end </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. Can't you see, we're crushing the hearts of the innocent. We're teaching them to fail. And how it breaks me to see how we're living and punishing the ones that need us to care. To see them hurting. Feels like knuckles to the back of my head </segment2>
		<segment3>Where have the days gone that a promise was forever. Families stuck together </segment3>
		<segment4>We wonder why their generation struggles to get by. There's no one to help what can I do to change what I see. This vicious cycle must come to an end.     </segment4>
