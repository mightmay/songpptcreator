		<segment1>I cant walk without watching where Im going. I cant speak without knowing what to say. I cant love without any hesitation, cause I know that you dont work that way. I cant reach without something to offer. I cant come now, I am so ashamed. I cant hold out for you any longer, cause I know that you dont work that way</segment1>
		<segment2>Im not gonna fight you anymore. Im not gonna try to lock the door. You took your life and gave me yours. Theres no reason why, I shouldnt trust you with mine</segment2>
		<segment3>Its never easy changing direction. Its so unnatural to loosen up my grip. Are you growing weary, of all my good intentions, cause I know that you dont work that way</segment3>
		<segment4>Im not gonna fight you anymore. Im not gonna try to lock the door. You took your life and gave me yours. Theres no reason why, I shouldnt trust you with mine</segment4>
		<segment5>Some days this weight upon my shoulders is my shame I know I should know better. Cause you say that I must now surrender, theres no other way</segment5>
		<segment6>Im not gonna fight you anymore. Im not gonna try to lock the door. I needed life, you gave me yours. You took your life and gave me yours. Theres no reason why, I shouldnt trust you with mine</segment6>
		<segment7>Im not gonna fight you anymore. Im not gonna try to lock the door. You took your life and gave me yours. Theres no reason why, no good reason why. I shouldnt trust you with mine</segment7>
