		<segment1>I tried to write a song and keep it 3 minutes long. Get in get out nobody gets hurt. And i tried a thousand times to fit god between the lines. But i'm finding out that doesn't really work. . I just don't have the words to say 'cause words only get in my way. I must apologize i have the hardest time. Finding something to define a god that i can't define. And even if i could it would take way too long. If all i've got's a 3 minute song. . I've got a hundred metaphors and if i had a million more. I could never ever seem to sum this up. Besides how can some melody communicate eternity. It's like trying to fit the ocean in a cup. . I never find the words to say 'cause words only get in my way. I must apologize i have the hardest time. Finding something to define a god that i can't define. And even if i could it would take way too long. If all i've got's a 3 minute song. . I would like to dumb this down to 3 chords or maybe 4. But i've tried and i can't and i won't 'cause there will always be more. So i apologize i can't seem to get it right. . I must apologize i have the hardest time. Finding something to define a god i just can't define. And even if i could it would take way too long. If all i've got's a 3 minute song. Well all i've got's a 3 minute song oh oh oh oh oh oh    </segment1>
