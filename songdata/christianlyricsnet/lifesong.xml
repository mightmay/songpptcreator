		<segment1>Empty hands held high. Such a small sacrifice. If not joined with my life. I sing in vain tonight</segment1>
		<segment2>May the words I say. And the things I do. Make my lifesong sing. Bring a smile to You</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Let my lifesong sing to You. Let my lifesong sing to You. I want to sign your name to the end of this day. Knowing that my heart was true. Let my lifesong sing to You</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, I give my life. A living sacrifice. To reach a world in need. To be Your hands and feet</segment4>
		<segment5>So may the words I say. And the things I do. Make my lifesong sing. Bring a smile to you</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let my lifesong sing to You. (2x) </segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus 2x)    </segment8>
