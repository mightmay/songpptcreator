		<segment1>Whats it gonna take for me?. Im on my hands and knees. While all the poets fill pages of loose leaf. I feel cheap and I feel empty. We will bathe in the sea of disbelief. But we will not go quickly. No we will not die so easily. And I knew that this would happen, it always does. And I couldnt stop my reaction so I let it come. I let it come</segment1>
		<segment2>I still hold the belief that we are free. That we dont need the rules to see. That despite what weve done were not alone. Were closer than we think to home</segment2>
		<segment3>It didnt take me too long to believe that I could do anything. We turn the songs up loud so we can sing. I am true and I am living. We will walk through the valley of the shadow of the boring and burn it all. No we will not go quietly</segment3>
		<segment4>Across the water you call me, but Im not listening as I sink down. Water fills my lungs as I begin to drown. I knew that this would happen    </segment4>
