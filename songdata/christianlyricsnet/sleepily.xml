		<segment1>Quietly I drown myself in dreams. To find it all I've taken liberty to fall asleep. Wanting everything</segment1>
		<segment2>If you awake to find it's all the same. I'll try again. I swear I'll try again to fall asleep. Wanting everything. Just to be completely free</segment2>
		<segment3>At least believe there's something else this time. You know you'll find me here asleep under this spell. Who'll notice?. I'm wondering myself</segment3>
		<segment4>Now you gaze between love and despair. It's hard to see a look become a prayer to fall asleep. Wanting everything. Just to be completely free</segment4>
		<segment5>At least believe there's something else this time. You know you'll find me here asleep under this spell. Who'll notice?. I'm wondering myself</segment5>
		<segment6>All at once it occurred to me: It's the way that I'll ever be. Well never mind. What I meant to say was along the lines of making you stay. And I whisper this as you walk away. &quot;At least believe in me&quot;</segment6>
		<segment7>At least believe there's something else this time. You know you'll find me here asleep under this spell. Who'll notice?. I'm wondering myself    </segment7>
