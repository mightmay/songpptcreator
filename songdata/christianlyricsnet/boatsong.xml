		<segment1>If you were a boat my darling a boat my darling Id be the wind at your back. If you were afraid my darling afraid my darling Id be the courage you lack. </segment1>
		<segment2>If you were a bird then Id be a tree, and you would come home my darling to me. If you were asleep then Id be a dream, wherever you are thats where my heart will be. </segment2>
		<segment3>oh do you know we belong together, oh do you know my heart is yours. </segment3>
		<segment4>If you were the ocean then Id be the sand. If you were a song Id be the band. If you were the stars then Id be the moon. A light in the dark my darling for you. </segment4>
		<segment5>oh do you know we belong together, oh do you know my heart is yours. </segment5>
		<segment6>oh do you know we belong together, oh do you know my heart is yours. oh do you know we belong together, oh do you know my heart is yours.    </segment6>
