		<segment1>Our numbers are growing stronger. Can't ignore us any longer. Old schol to new tell your crew. We've got a long way to go before we're through. But together, we'll make them hear our voice. Raise your fist, make a stand. This time we'll make them understand. The kids are growing stronger. Our voices our getting louder. The only difference is their weakness. We'll make the difference. Raise your fist right now. Can you be strong?. Can you hold on?. Raise your fist right now.    </segment1>
