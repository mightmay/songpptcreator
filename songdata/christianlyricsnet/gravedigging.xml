		<segment1>I've been sitting in the suicide lane on highway 99, Looking for a sign in the headlights. Well I've been to war with my mind, But things will be different this time, I won't be putting up a fight.</segment1>
		<segment2>Give me your poison pills cause I'm. Digging my star-crossed grave tonight. No longer living a lie, no longer living. No longer living a lie, no longer living.</segment2>
		<segment3>I've been sitting by the train tracks. Near the back door of my mind, Waiting for the planets to align. Well I've got every good reason. To make this open season. I'll hang my head above your mantle piece tonight.</segment3>
		<segment4>Give me your poison pills cause I'm. Digging my star-crossed grave tonight. No longer living a lie, no longer living. No longer living a lie, no longer living.</segment4>
		<segment5>Grave digging, grave digging, grave digging. We're digging our own grave!</segment5>
		<segment6>Give me your poison pills cause I'm. Digging my star-crossed grave tonight. No longer living a lie, no longer living. No longer living a lie, no longer living.     </segment6>
