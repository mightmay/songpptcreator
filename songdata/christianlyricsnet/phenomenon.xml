		<segment1>One Phenomenon, one phenomenon. And it just cant be stopped yall</segment1>
		<segment2>We rock forever, we stop whenever. We rock forever, we stop whenever. We die whenever, we live forever. Its a phenomenon that cant be stopped. Forever, we stop whenever. We rock forever, we stop whenever. We die whenever, we live together. Its a phenomenon that cant be stopped now</segment2>
		<segment3>Everybody out of the way. Its monumental at the end of the day. So come what may. But its a wonder that will never fade. A marvel that will tickle the mind. Its unaccountable in actual time. But when were free. They will see what we were destined to be</segment3>
		<segment4>Well Im alive and Im enjoyin the ride. But livin for the moment I die. Cause when Im done, we will run eternally as one. My soul is up, up and away. My body dead right where it lays. Im movin on going gone into the new beyond</segment4>
		<segment5>This is the drama youve been waiting for. A new dimension that is yours to explore. Such mystery is looming at your door. This is the moment Ive been praying for.     </segment5>
