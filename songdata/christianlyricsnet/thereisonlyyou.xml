		<segment1>Growing more uneasy with every question asked. It seems you're jealous of my interests. And the graven things I've cast. Waking resolutions of twenty years or more. That I would disallow golden cows my favor anymore</segment1>
		<segment2>Your wishes set in stone, I broke the first of ten. I've cleared this temple out come take your place again</segment2>
		<segment3>There is only You. There is only You</segment3>
		<segment4>Tiptoe from an awkward scene. Not fooling anyone. Am I dumb enough to kneel with my accusers. Or brave enough to run</segment4>
		<segment5>Petty daggers bounce weakly off my back. I'm leaving breathless gods and secrets in my tracks. Your wishes set in stone, I broke the first of ten. I've cleared this temple out come take Your place again</segment5>
		<segment6>There is only You. There is only You, believe me. There is only You. There is only You</segment6>
		<segment7>To a thousand generations. Of the faithful man. You will show Your favor Lord</segment7>
		<segment8>There is only You (Love earth can't replace). There is only You, believe me (Heaven can't erase). There is only You (Find me on my penitent face). There is only You.     </segment8>
