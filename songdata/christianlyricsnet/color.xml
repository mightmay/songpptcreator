		<segment1>Just because my skin is brown. It don't define who I am. I could be a porcupine. Or I could be a little lamb</segment1>
		<segment2>Please don't try and judge me. Only by the colors you have seen. To love me is to know me. Whether red, yellow, black or green</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). Color is skin deep. But true beauty lives on and on. Color is skin deep. But true beauty lives on and on</segment3>
		<segment4>Her skin might be ivory. And he might be from Japan. But that don't make a better woman. That don't make a lesser man</segment4>
		<segment5>Please don't try to judge 'em. Only by the colors you have seen. To love 'em is to know 'em. Whether red, yellow, white, or green</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>(Bridge). Color is the shape of the rainbow. Color is the tint of the sky. It's not a person, place or thing. It's only a description of you and I. Like the colors on the frame of a house. Will not tell you of the colors within. So why would I try to judge. A man by the shade of his skin?</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus).     </segment8>
