		<segment1>Falling on my knees in worship. Giving all I am to seek your face. Lord all I am is yours</segment1>
		<segment2>My whole life. I place in your hands. God of Mercy. Humbled I bow down. In your presence at your throne</segment2>
		<segment3>I called you answered. And you came to my rescue and I. I wanna be where you are</segment3>
		<segment4>In my life be lifted high. In our world be lifted high. In our love be lifted high    </segment4>
