		<segment1>I live but only for today. 'Cause I died but that was yesterday. But doubt is such a lonly place. When faith is half the world away. Just come away </segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause you know the sun is gonna shine. For yours and for mine, Just leave it all behind. And I know when I see it in your eyes. You need freedom from this life. Just take it to the brighterside </segment2>
		<segment3>Well, I live just to see you smile. But I know that it could take a while. But I loved, I loved you all the while. And for you, you know I'd walk for miles     </segment3>
