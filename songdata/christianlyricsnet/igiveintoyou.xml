		<segment1>Heard you knocking at my door. And although I should have answered. I ignored. But you kept a louder call. And in time you would have. Broken down my walls</segment1>
		<segment2>So I give in to you. I give in to you. I know it's gonna hurt but I concede. I believe in you. I agree with you. And I'm holding on to you for all I need </segment2>
		<segment3>All the sin inside of me. Caused a wound inside my soul. And still it bleeds. But I ignored the remedy. Even though I know you hold . The antidote for my disease</segment3>
		<segment4>So I give in to you. I give in to you. I know it's gonna hurt but I concede. I believe in you. I agree with you. And I'm holding on to you for all I need </segment4>
		<segment5>With your hands upon me. And your path before me. It's gonna be alright</segment5>
		<segment6>I give in to you. I give in to you. I know it's gonna hurt but I concede. I believe in you. I agree with you. And I'm holding on to you for all I need </segment6>
