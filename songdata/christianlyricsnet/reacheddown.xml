		<segment1>I fell so far I did not know anyone could save me. I could not find a light as far as I could see. My body lay broken at the bottom of my prison. My hope washed away as the waves crashed over me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You reached down and saved me. You parted the sea so I could breathe. You reached down and saved me. You pulled me from all that was drowning me</segment2>
		<segment3>I could not see the top of the well in which I'd fallen. I was choking on the rising tide of filth and shame. You pulled me from the mouth of hell so You could hold me. You knew You'd save me long before I called Your name</segment3>
