		<segment1>I've watched my dreams all fade away. And blister in the sun. Everything I've ever had is unraveled and undone. I've set upon a worthless stack. Of my ambitious plans. And the people that I've loved the most. Have turned their backs and ran </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. This is the good life. I've lost everything. I could ever want. And ever dream of. This is the good life. I found everything. I could ever need. Here in Your arms </segment2>
		<segment3>Loneliness has left me searching. For someone to love. Poverty has changed my view. Of what true riches are. Sorrow's opened up my eyes. To see what real joy is. Pain has been the catalyst. To my heart's happiness </segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]. What good would it be. If you had everything. But you wouldn't have. The only thing you need </segment4>
		<segment5>[CHORUS].     </segment5>
