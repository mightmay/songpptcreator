		<segment1>My train pulled in to Waterloo. I found myself wishing you. Were here with me in London. Standing on the river Thames. Taking photographs of Parliament. And old Big Ben was ringing</segment1>
		<segment2>You know its everything that I imagined it would be. I had no idea that it would feel this empty</segment2>
		<segment3>Where are you tonight. While I stand here and cry. Watching double-decker buses pass me by. And to tell you the truth. Its all that I can do. To keep from jumping a plane thats headed home. To you</segment3>
		<segment4>I took a stroll down Abbey Road. Tried to peak inside the studios. And somewhere along the way I bought you flowers. And a pocket map of the Underground. Cause You and I both know I get turned around. Im so lost without you</segment4>
		<segment5>Though its everything that I imagined it would be. I had no idea that it would feel this empty</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>6 long nights and seven days Ill cross the pond back to the states. I cant wait</segment7>
		<segment8>Where are you tonight while I stand here and cry. Watching all the black umbrellas pass me by. And to tell you the truth its all that I can do. To keep from jumping on a plane headed home. So Im jumping on a plane headed home to you</segment8>
