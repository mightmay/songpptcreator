		<segment1>[Part I: Deception]</segment1>
		<segment2>Death reigns over the earth. Opressing justice and truth. Nations plagued by despair. Are collapsing hopelessly into themselves. We watch while sanity dies. Forever lost upon the Earth. Countless souls embracing condemnation. One by one marching to the grave. Into the Mouth of the ruin that feeds upon the Damned and the Deceived. And they will cry there is no life here only death. Deceived. Wide is the path that leads to destruction. Wide is that pathway down into the pit of despair</segment2>
