		<segment1>When theres nothing left to give. I will give you more than I ever gave before. When theres nothing left left to say. Ill say it all again, but until then</segment1>
		<segment2>And Ill give you my heart, say I love you. Say I love you. And Ill give you my heart, say I love you. Oh, cause I do, Jesus</segment2>
		<segment3>No music to play so I sing you my own song. Come on and sing along. When theres nothing that remains. You still stay the same. Youre looking so strong</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>When theres nothing left to give. I will give you more than I ever gave before    </segment5>
