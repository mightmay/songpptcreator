		<segment1>Say the word foolish. Say dazed and confused. Say there's no way to do this. In this clueless, senseless world</segment1>
		<segment2>But you can't say that we are alone. You can't say that we are alone anymore. You can't say that we are alone. We are anything else, we are anything else. Cause love is here. Cause love is here with me now</segment2>
		<segment3>Say He's a liar</segment3>
		<segment4>But I know He's the Savior (and Son?). Cause the veil has been torn and the walls are erased.     </segment4>
