		<segment1>We wear it on our face. We keep up with the pace and dont slow down. But perfection without grace. Is such a lonely place to be found. We go round and round and never really move at all</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, we are bruised and destined to lose doing this alone. Oh, let it fall and cover us all  this grace thats not our own</segment2>
		<segment3>See it in our eyes. Were running for the prize, dont burn out. But without a hand to hold. Well never really know what lifes about. We go round and round and never really move at all</segment3>
		<segment4>Lets live like were alive. Well take the pain in stride. Well learn from our mistakes and be glad we ever tried. Lets live like were alive. Live like were alive and run with him into the night!.     </segment4>
