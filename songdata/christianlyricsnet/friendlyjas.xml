		<segment1>It was a blessed day--. The day that I met you. Though at the time. I didnt have a clue. As iron sharpens iron so does one man another. And thats what God intended us to do (Psalm 27:17)</segment1>
		<segment2>Flowers fall and seasons change (Isaiah 40:8). And you know how we treat the rain. In times of drought we pray it comes. And when it falls we turn and run. The moon is new, youve left your seat (I Samuel 20:18). The time has come to go in peace (I Samuel 20:42). With my own hand the bow was strung. The arrow shot now falls beyond (I Samuel 20:36)</segment2>
		<segment3>I thank my God for every (Philippians 1:3). Memory of you. The lessons learned and. The way the Spirit moved. I remember hearing church is more than just a building. I remember when we proved it true</segment3>
		<segment4>Flowers fall and seasons change. And you know how we treat the rain. In times of drought we pray it comes. And when it falls we turn and run. The moon is new; youve left your seat. The time has come to go in peace. With my own hand the bow was strung. The arrow shot now falls beyond</segment4>

		<segment6>Everything has changed. But our hope remains the same. I want you to know that Ill be here. Through a hundred years of rain</segment6>
		<segment7>Together we run into what we do not know. Trusting our God who made tomorrow    </segment7>
