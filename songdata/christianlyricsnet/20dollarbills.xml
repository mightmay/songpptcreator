		<segment1>When you're done with the run. I wanna take your height. Like everybody else. Who knows you're coming back. By luring all your friends. With a neverending light. Not 20 dollar bills. That never change your life. That never change your life</segment1>
		<segment2>When you're done with the run. I wanna take your height. Like everybody else. With a double-decker house. By luring all your friends. With a neverending light. Not 20 dollar bills. That never change your life. That never change your life    </segment2>
