		<segment1>Fly to the moon. Well, you could do it if you wanted to. Try flying high. The only limit is the endless sky. So, go on and fly to the moon</segment1>
		<segment2>Live in the sun. You know your living has just begun. So much ahead. Don't let the night leave you for dead. So, come on, live in the sun</segment2>
		<segment3>Fly to the moon. And when you find your wings I will celebrate with you. Watch you as you soar. Take the wishes that are yours. And let them fly you to the moon</segment3>
		<segment4>Dream on a star. You can let it take you near or far. Feet on the ground. Don't let anybody hold you down. So, go on and dream on a star</segment4>
		<segment5>Fly to the moon. And when you find your wings. I will celebrate with you. Watch you as you soar. Take the wishes that are yours. I know you can fly to the moon. You can do all things. I will celebrate with you. It's hard to let you go. Still, you have to go, I know</segment5>
		<segment6>So go on, fly to the moon. And as you spread your wings. I will celebrate with you. Hope we taught you good. Hope you know that if I could. I would fly away with you</segment6>
		<segment7>Gotaa take it all the way. When you follow dreams. Follow far. Flying high and away. You're flying all the way. To the moon    </segment7>
