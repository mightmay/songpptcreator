		<segment1>Play dead again. It just might stop before the end. If I pretend you may not see the pain I'm in. So close to me, can't tell what I'm supposed to be. Don't stop to breathe, can't bear to think what you might see. This tourniquet, these blessed hands around my head. So I can keep from.. . Bleeding. I've got to find a way to stop before it starts. Finding its way through my veins right to my heart. I never thought it something everyone could see. And it kills within me. . CHORUS: I won't, I won't leave without a trace. I won't be erased. . It's in my head, I can't forget what you once said. The words I read, the fractured soul that I can't mend. Right here with me, killing the void I used to be. Remembering through fading sparks of memory. Two broken hands lift seven wounds and fight to stand. To keep the lungs from.. . Caving. I've got to find a way to stop before it starts. Finding its way through my veins right to my heart. I never thought it something everyone could see. And it kills within me. . (CHORUS). . Turning. It's moving. Escaping right through me. I care not. I bleed not. For you I believe not. I play dead.     </segment1>
