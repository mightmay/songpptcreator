		<segment1>Who could it be it's. Probably me I know. There's something wrong. It should be a big. Mistake to let this go to. Long maybe it's all inside. My mind with no room. Left to grow and now it's. Coming outside and it. Just won't let me go why. Does it matter where. You've been because I. CAre for you my friend I. Can't read into you mind. What's been going of. Inside? miscom-munica-. Tion always seems to. Turn around those. Beneficial doubts those. Smiles into frowns how. Can I remember if. I never even knew you. Can't pin all on. Me it's also up to you.     </segment1>
