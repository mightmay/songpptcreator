		<segment1>There's a familiar progression to the similar lives that we all lead. We're trying hard to become someone we can't be. You won't find grace without honesty</segment1>
		<segment2>Everyone wants reality, so here it is. I believe that nobody is good, nobody is good</segment2>
		<segment3>We are liars and thieves, we're destroying the peace. But we're trying, we're trying, we're trying</segment3>
		<segment4>It's the same regression to the lives that we all lead. Everyone makes mistakes, but we find grace. We believe there's redemption, there's redemption</segment4>
		<segment5>If you want reality, here it is. I believe that nobody is good, nobody is good, nobody is good</segment5>
		<segment6>There is nothing in our blood that makes the heart beat strong enough. Apart from grace, apart from love. I believe in grace. I believe with love that we can do good. We can do good, we can do good, we can do good.     </segment6>
