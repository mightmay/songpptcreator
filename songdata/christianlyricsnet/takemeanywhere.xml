		<segment1>Dont let me drift too far out to sea. You know that is where I tend to go. I thought I heard somebody say. That you were walking by. Can you find the time to come in and stay awhile?</segment1>
		<segment2>You can take me anywhere. You want to go, anytime. Just let me know and I will be. Waiting for you. And If I break upon the shore. I will know I need you more. So desperately, waiting for you. You can take me anywhere</segment2>
		<segment3>There is nothing that can separate. Me from all the grace that you have shown. I know I heard somebody say. That you are walking by. Can you find the time to come in and stay awhile?</segment3>
		<segment4>We can talk awhile. Anything you want to say is fine. Let me into what is on your mind. Whatever you do dont leave me behind. Dont leave me </segment4>
