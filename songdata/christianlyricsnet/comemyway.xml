		<segment1>Just to see your face and touch the healer's hand. Desperate, I push through the crowd. If I could touch your clothes. I could feel your power</segment1>
		<segment2>Come my way</segment2>
		<segment3>Please look. And notice me. Just to release my pain. Just to know your name</segment3>
		<segment4>Come my way I'm out of touch. I'm out of reach. I've got the faith to believe. Am I out of touch or out of reach. What would it take for you to walk towards me</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm out of touch, out of reach. But I'm running towards you and it's all I believe</segment5>
		<segment6>Come my way</segment6>
		<segment7>Just a touch    </segment7>
