		<segment1>My eyes roll back into my head, i'm trying to keep my head on straight to. understand. Remember what he said, &quot;Yes, I do believe&quot;. A smile reached the surface.</segment1>
		<segment2>Free me. You have freed me, I will not suffer anymore, Suffer anymore. I'm alive.</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm scared stiff, i'm shakin' in my boots. When you come face to face with the reason. you exsist. I'm holdin' on to truth, and livin' like a king. I'm tired now, somehow I will survive. I can't remember. how it feels to be alright.</segment3>
		<segment4>By grace, you have freed me, I will not. suffer anymore, I will not suffer anymore, suffer anymore. I'm alive.     </segment4>
