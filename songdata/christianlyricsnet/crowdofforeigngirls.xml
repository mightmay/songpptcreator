		<segment1>Well, Egypt girls are hip, I really dig my wife from there. And the Sidon girls with their pagan gods. They Tyred me out and I got snared. The Middle East foreign leaders gave me pagan female wives. And the Moab girls with the way they kiss. They make their boyfriends Moabites</segment1>
		<segment2>I kissed an awful big crowd of foreign girls. I guess they altered me kinda sorta. My wisdom faltered because of foreign girls</segment2>
		<segment3>I guess I had a fun time as the world's most richest man. I think I had at least a thousand wives counting concubines. From all these different lands. I ran around with pagan girls. And I gave 'em all diamonds n' pearls. Yeah, but I should've stayed with girls who had the same faith. That's with the Jewish girls in the world</segment3>
		<segment4>I'd list them all and recount 'em for ya. I just don't want to be proud and bore ya. It's just an awful big crowd of foreign girls</segment4>
		<segment5>So listen close to me I'll inform ya. (Girls, girls, girls yeah I said). My ship got lost at sea kinda sorta. (Girls, girls, girls yeah I said). I switched philosophies now I'll warn ya. (Girls, girls, girls yeah I said). They just ain't worth the grief I implore ya. (Girls, girls, girls yeah I said)</segment5>
