		<segment1>Rotting from the innards out. Another decade and theyre vanishing. What is it to you? What is it to me?. Theres nothing we can do so Ill just leave it the same. Stolen from our sight and mind. Swept under the rug. No shame. Oblivious to the poverty and were the ones to blame.</segment1>
		<segment2>Consumers venerate the power to take away. Its burning ever closer killing them everyday.</segment2>
		<segment3>The pleasure to disregard it. Those children feel the sting. Conversely we forget them with every passing day. Theyll never go away and here we stay.</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh Oho. Selfish Americans.</segment4>
		<segment5>Recognize their plight. Take a look at them. We take from granted our God given freedom;. Theyve got nothing our there. We need to lend an unselfish hand, commit ourselves to serve. Theres so much we have  we dont know what to do, and the answer is already there    </segment5>
