		<segment1>How firm a foundation ye saints of the Lord, Is laid for your faith in His excellent word. What more can he say, than to you he hath said;. To you, who for refuge to Jesus have fled? </segment1>
		<segment2>Fear not, I am with thee, oh be not dismayed. For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid. I strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand, Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand. </segment2>
		<segment3>When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, My grace all-sufficient shall be thy supply. The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design. Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine. </segment3>
		<segment4>The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose, I will not, I will not desert to His foes. That soul, though all Hell should endeavor to shake. I'll never, no never, no never forsake.    </segment4>
