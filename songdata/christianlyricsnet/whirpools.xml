		<segment1>Tranquil eyes follow shady lines. Roaming through broken hearts and shattered morals. Your aeroplane falling from the sky. Devastating trust in you pentagon of truth. You instrument dying to play your song. But you never let it wake up now and smell your roses</segment1>
		<segment2>There's trouble in this town, Secretly abounds. Every time you open to someone else. Open up too late, Secrets that await. Sometimes you forgive yourself</segment2>
		<segment3>Your aeroplane falling from your life. Crash down your earth with covered open lie. The drums you play offer synchronized. Errors that you make every time you open wide. Your instrument dying to play your song. But you never let it. Wake up now and smell your roses    </segment3>
