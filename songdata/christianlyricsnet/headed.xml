		<segment1>Anchor up, tow me out of this pit I'm dreading. Turn this vessel's path around. I look above, I'm in love. With the pace you're setting. From this stream we're ocean bound</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. And I know for sure I'm headed straight for the edge. And I know for sure I'm headed straight for the edge. 'Cause that's just where You are</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm the son, you're the King. Makes me royalty now. It's no title without pain. In the end it is well. After storms and beatings. These muddy rivers empty out</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>That's where You are</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
