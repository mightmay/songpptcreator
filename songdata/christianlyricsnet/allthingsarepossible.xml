		<segment1>Almighty God my Redeemer, my hiding place, my strong refuge. No other name like Jesus, no power can stand against you. My feet are planted on this rock and I will not be shaken. My hope it comes from you alone, my Rock and my Salvation. Your praise is always on my lips, your Word is living in my heart. And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will bless you Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>You fill my life with greater joy, as I delight myself in you. And I will praise you with a new song, my soul will bless you Lord</segment2>
