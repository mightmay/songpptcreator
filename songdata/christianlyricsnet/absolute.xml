		<segment1>I've tried to hide, but I can't sleep at night. Everything I think about makes me feel like a version of myself. They tell their lies and we all syncronize. Look to the sky because it's almost over</segment1>
		<segment2>We want the truth, give us the Absolute. We need your help, 'cause we've got nothing!</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: We want the truth, give us the Absolute. We need your help, 'cause we've got nothing left to lose. I know we've tried this thing a million times. But put me out, 'cause I'm on fire</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't talk if you aren't gonna tell me the truth. Don't tell me you know and that you've got everything under control. We can't have it all, but we can break the fall. This time I'm letting go, 'cause I can't take it anymore</segment4>
		<segment5>We want the truth, give us the Absolute. We need your help, 'cause we've got nothing!</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>Wait 'til the bottle breaks, see how it all shakes. Who's gonna be around? Who's gonna hear the sound?. Wait 'til the smoke clears, who's gonna volunteer?. Stand if you're gonna stand, everybody's here. Take what you're gonna take, make what you want to make. Say what you're gonna say and break if you're gonna break</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS</segment8>
		<segment9>We want the truth. We need your help. I know, we've tried, this thing a million times. but pour, me out, 'cause I'm on fire    </segment9>
