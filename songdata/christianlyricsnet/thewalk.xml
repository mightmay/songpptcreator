		<segment1>I've got a Grandpa Rudd. He gave thirty years to the lumberyard. Loving his family and working hard. Got a faith like a solid rock. He's just doing the walk. I've got a friend named Larry. He sends me letters from a foreign land. He moved there with his kids and his pretty wife Mary. To answer a holy call. He's just doing the walk</segment1>
		<segment2>You can run with the big dogs, you can fly with the eagles. You can jump through all the hoops and climb the ladder to the top. But when it all comes down, you know it all comes down to the walk. It all comes down to the walk</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a man I know. He said He'd come to show us the way. He died on a cross and He rose from the grave. And proved He was more than talk. He taught us the walk. And now I'm singing my songs. Standing up on a big, bright stage. And I do my dance while the music plays. But when the music stops. Am I doing the walk?</segment3>
		<segment4>You can run with the big dogs, you can fly with the eagles. You can jump through all the hoops and climb the ladder to the top. But when it all comes down, you know it all comes down to this</segment4>
		<segment5>Do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with your God. Do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with your God. Do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with your God. Do justly, love mercy, walk humbly with your God</segment5>
		<segment6>You can run with the big dogs, you can fly with the eagles. You can jump through all the hoops and climb the ladder to the top. But when it all comes down, you know it all comes down to the walk. It all comes down to the walk </segment6>
