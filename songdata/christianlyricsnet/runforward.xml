		<segment1>Oh, won't you show what you're feeling?. Is it too much to ask that your heart be revealing?. Just a little bit, oh, just a little bit, just a little</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't think I've ever informed you. I love you desperately even though I only know you. Just a little bit, oh, just a little bit, just a little</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, how'd we get so disconnected?. My heart is shutting down, I just can't let it</segment3>
		<segment4>So I'll run forward and pray you fall back. Grace will come and clear your path. Yeah, I'll run forward and you fall back. Come back</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, you treat your time like you own it. It's slipping fast away and you're not getting younger. Not even a bit, no, not even a bit, no, not at all</segment5>
		<segment6>This love is a battle we're fighting. You've laid your armor down, oh, and now I can't find it. Not even a bit, no, not even a bit, no, not at all</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, you took your love for granted. But oh, it never left you for a second</segment7>
		<segment8>So I'll run forward and pray you fall back. Grace will come and clear your path. Yeah, I'll run forward and you fall back. Oh, I'll run forward and you fall back</segment8>
		<segment9>You make me afraid. Thank you, I've got to thank you. 'Cause now I know His strength. Thank you, I've gotta thank you. So please don't run away, oh. Don't run, don't run</segment9>
		<segment10>So I'll run forward and pray you run back. Grace will come and clear my path. Yeah, I'll run forward and if you run back. Oh, I'll run forward and if you run back. Oh, I'll run forward and you fall back</segment10>
		<segment11>Come back, I pray you'll come back, my love. Come back and grace will come to clear your path. Oh, I'll run forward if you fall back. You come back, my love, come back    </segment11>
