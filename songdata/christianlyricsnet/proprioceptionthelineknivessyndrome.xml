	<english>
		<segment1>When your life turns upside down. and it will some day. where is your proprioceptive sense?</segment1>
		<segment2>Like the feline that finds the floor on all fours. is the house built on rock that the devil abhors. build your house on sand to find. a cat with one life instead of nine</segment2>
		<segment3>Proprioception. balance correction. innate sense gives direction</segment3>
		<segment4>Break your fall with daggers. as your focus staggers - the line knives syndrome</segment4>
		<segment5>Ghinger, Abyssinian, Tsukahara, Skaukatt, Yurchenko, Korat</segment5>
		<segment6>To &quot;see&quot; with that sixth sense. when there's no sign of the other five. 3  inward pike - the sense that keeps the diver alive</segment6>
		<segment7>Proprioception. balance correction. innate sense gives direction.     </segment7>
