		<segment1>You have a new way / Is it a better way?. Once I saw you proclaim / Now theres slight disdain. Why keep that title, what has changed? Is God so different?. Why keep that title, what has changed? Is He not the same?</segment1>
		<segment2>Love is present, grace abounds. What happened here? Was the world so enticing?. Denial is treachery hard to reconcile. Call it for what it really is / Dont make excuses. Call it for what it really is / Go ahead apostasy</segment2>
		<segment3>Tepid waters do not run / Stagnation breeds disease. Flies surround / Multiply maggot parasites. Why keep that title? Why redefine?. Lord of the flies / Apostasy, Apostasy</segment3>
		<segment4>Love is present, grace abounds. What happened here? Was the world so enticing?. Denial is treachery hard to reconcile. Call it for what it really is / Dont make excuses. Call it for what it really is / Go ahead apostasy</segment4>
		<segment5>Do not conform to one man / God is clear on who you are. Love, grace and mercy are there / Do not pretend apostasy    </segment5>
