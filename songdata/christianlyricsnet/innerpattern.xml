		<segment1>Awaken the inner pattern. A murmur of self. A heart between beats. Tearing out the pages left and right. Of the human letter. In a burning moment. Threaded with compassion. Bound and held tight. In form and fashion. Bleeding restoration. Into a heart that's grave. Breathing in life into our lungs. Into our throats like open graves. Our eyes aren't closed. Our eyes are asleep. You have dreamt long enough. With open eyes. There is no escape for those. Who betray their inner self. Are we absent in thoughts of escape?. While our minds sleep. In days we saved. You've cut all ties. And broken all your bonds. To your inner self. Now you will lie. An unhappy life away. Let the fire in your eyes. Burn it clean inside. Let the blood revise the ink. In your veins. This world won't define our hope. We'll sit through the ashes. Until we find what's true in our hearts. And write it there. For this is what strikes fear in the heart of man. These are the days that we've made. And the chances that we'll take. We can't carry this vessel to shore. Without an anchor of hope    </segment1>
