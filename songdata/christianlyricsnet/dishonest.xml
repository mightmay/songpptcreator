		<segment1>I've tried to get to know you so I began to watch your life. It all seemed so natural to me it made me look at who I was. As I looked straight in your eyes I saw a part of your heart. and without realizing feelings crept in my heart. I can't be myself.</segment1>
		<segment2>When I got to know you better and heard about all your faults. I learned you're not so different from me, so why can't I just be myself. It wasn't so hard to see. Lovers are blind don't see the truth. It was wrong to hold you high now I see you in the right light. I can't be myself.</segment2>
		<segment3>I am not much different, what do I lose if I am upright. You are not much different, what do you lose if you are upright. We are not much different, what do we loose if we are upright. I can't be myself.    </segment3>
