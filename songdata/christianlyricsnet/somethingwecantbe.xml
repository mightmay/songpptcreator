		<segment1>Lyrics: Dictate. What you think is pivotal. Mandate. Just for the sake of. Ego. Controlling your decision making. The world we're missing is still ours for the taking </segment1>
		<segment2>Accelerate. Into isolation. Gravitate. To comfort, presentation. Anxiety laden, restless confusion. No courage, no confidence, absent delusion </segment2>
		<segment3>Most of us would be lying. Holding fast to denying. If we. Said we're all feeling swell and content. All of us would be slipping. Backpedaling, gripping. So tight. To our fragile confidence </segment3>
		<segment4>We're trying. Just to convince the world we're. Something. That we can't be. We are not. Afraid of. Being alone. Of being caught. By ourselves. With only. Our own thoughts </segment4>
		<segment5>Activate. With hope and integrity. Honesty. The only true currency. Devastate. The guilt, not the guilty. And I promise a better night's sleep.     </segment5>
