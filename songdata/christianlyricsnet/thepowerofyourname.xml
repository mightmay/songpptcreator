		<segment1>Surely children weren't made for the streets. And fathers were not made to leave. Surely this isn't how it should be. Let Your Kingdom come</segment1>
		<segment2>Surely nations were not made for war. Or the broken meant to be ignored. Surely this just can't be what You saw. Let Your Kingdom come. Here in my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>I will live. To carry Your compassion. To love a world that's broken. To be Your hands and feet. I will give. With the life that I've been given. And go beyond religion. To see the world be changed. By the power of Your name</segment3>
		<segment4>Surely life wasn't made to regret. And the lost were not made to forget. Surely faith without action is dead. Let Your Kingdom come. Lord break this heart</segment4>
		<segment5>Your name. Is a shelter for the hurting. Jesus Your name. Is a refuge for the weak. Only Your name. Can redeem the undeserving. Jesus Your name. Holds everything I need</segment5>
		<segment6>Surely children weren't made for the streets. And fathers were not made to leave. Surely this isn't how it should be     </segment6>
