		<segment1>We are here together, its been so long. Ive waited forever, for this day to come. And I wont leave you. alone tonight. Youre my heart. moving life inside</segment1>
		<segment2>We won't fall again, if you will let me lead. Well fall in love, if you will hold to me. Never let go, endure the pain to find no pain at all</segment2>
		<segment3>Forget all the records, previous lovers. Look into my eyes, to dissolve the others. Cause I know where. you have laid tonight. Im just one step away tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>Say that you need me, and I can give you everything your hearts been craving. Cause once Ive held your hand, I cannot stand, to see it waving goodbye</segment4>
		<segment5>Please dont go. Stay with me. Just stay with me    </segment5>
