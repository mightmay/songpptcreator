		<segment1>Any crown I've ever worn. I lay it down. Any praise I've ever gained. I give it all to You. For there's nothing in this world. That can compare. For You alone are worthy. You alone are worthy</segment1>
		<segment2>You are near to all who call. Upon Your name. Ever giving, ever loving. You remain the same. For You open up Your hands. And satisfy. I give You all the glory. Give You all the glory</segment2>
		<segment3>You are worthy oh Lord. Of all honour. You are worthy to receive. All praise. In Your presence I live. And with all I have to give. I will worship You..</segment3>
		<segment4>Honour You. Glorify Your holy name. I will worship You. Honour You. Glorify Your holy name    </segment4>
