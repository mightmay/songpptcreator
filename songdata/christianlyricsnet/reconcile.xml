		<segment1>We've both been mistreated, no wish to repeat this. You're sorry - you wonder. If ever I'll show you grace again</segment1>
		<segment2>My vision is tunneled, my motives, oh so rageful. But the mirror I'm reading. Says &quot;forgive, and then forgive again&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>Though there's a wrong. A grudge will tear us down. We wait too long, the air turns stale. Will we reconcile?. It's all we're needing reconcile. It's all we're needing to mend these broken smiles</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh miserable me, miserable you. The walls erected between us. You keep your side, I'll not intrude</segment4>
		<segment5>And we'll get used to this denial. Turn our heads and wait a while. Much too long, the air turns stale. Will we reconcile?    </segment5>
