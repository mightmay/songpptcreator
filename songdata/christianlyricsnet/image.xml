		<segment1>Breathe. This is the knowledge that I bring. Universal, worldwide culture. Inhale, exhale. I takes it all in. No second guessing. Truth brings forth a new passion. No second guessing. Push aside this fate for the ransom. Stands among, gold seven and lox'd up. White wool, fire eyes, glowing in red. Water of rush, planet hold, in double edge. Falling down dead, last first, it's one life</segment1>

		<segment3>Breathe. This is the knowledge that I bring. Universal, worldwide culture. Inhale, exhale</segment3>
		<segment4>I takes it all in. No second guessing. Truth brings forth a new passion. No second guessing. Push aside this fate for the ransom    </segment4>
