If tomorrow all the things were gone . I'd hoped for all my life . And I had to start again . With just my family by my side . I'd thank my God above . To be living here today . 'Cause the flag still stands for freedom . And they can't take that away </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: . And I'm proud to be an American . Where at least I know I'm free . And I won't forget the men who died . Who gave that right to me . And I gladly stand up next to you . And defend her still today . 'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land . God Bless the USA </segment2>
		<segment3>From the lakes of Minnesota . To the hills of Tennessee . Across the plains of Texas . From sea to shining sea . From Detroit down to Houston . And New York to LA . There's pride in every American heart . And it's time we stand and say </segment3>
