		<segment1>It's my turn, it's not your turn. It's my turn, get outta my way. It's my turn, go on complain. I'm comin' through anyway. Don't ask me why I'm like this. But lately I'm wonderin' if. It's come to pass. That the last shall be. first and the first shall be last. Then the voice says..</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Here's the way it oughtta be. You then me, then you then me. Well, I pray one day we'll all agree. And take it you then me, then you then me. Life could go you then me, then you then me</segment2>
		<segment3>It's easy, you wait then go. It's easy, so make your move. It's easy, don't clown around. Could've gone six times by now. But no sir, you gotta be a pain.

		<segment7>Let's try it, it could be good. And what if one day it should. Really come to pass. That the last shall. be first and the first shall be last. Betcha we'd say</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS    </segment8>
