		<segment1>I caught a glimpse of Your splendor. In the corner of my eye. The most beautiful thing I've even seen. And it was like a flash of lightning. Reflected off the sky. And I know I'll never be the same</segment1>
		<segment2>Show me Your glory. Send down Your presence. I want to see Your face. Show me Your glory. Majesty shines about You. I can't go on without You, Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>When I climb down the mountain. And get back to my life. I won't settle for ordinary things. I'm gonna follow You forever. For all of my days. I won't rest 'till I see You again</segment3>
		<segment4>Show me Your glory. Show me Your glory. I can't live without You    </segment4>
