		<segment1>nce again, you?e trying to see what? there outside. Every time, discovering a new compromise. With every move you're getting closer. Turning away, from what you believe. You never thought it could control you. You have been so easily deceived. Sensitive, of making any critical acclaim. Longing for, awaking to open up your eyes.    </segment1>
