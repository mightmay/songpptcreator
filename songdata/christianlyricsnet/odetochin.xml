		<segment1>What's your direction?. Tell me what's wrong, tell me what's right. What's your direction?. Think about somebody else for the night. Life's more than girls. God's more than words. You're more than this. So what's your direction?. And where are you now? </segment1>
		<segment2>Grow, grow where you are. Anchor your roots underneath. Doubt your doubts and believe your beliefs </segment2>
		<segment3>What's your direction?. What matters most?. What should you know?. What's your direction. All that you've been. Makes who you are now. 'Cause I've been ashamed. I've been a fool. You know I've backed down. When I lose direction I pray to be found </segment3>
		<segment4>Grow, grow where you are. Anchor your roots underneath. Doubt your doubts and believe your beliefs    </segment4>
