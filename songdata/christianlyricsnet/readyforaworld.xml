		<segment1>I've been standing on the edge. Waiting for a sign. Ready for the world to stop its turning. I've been looking everywhere. And it seems all that I find. Is evidence of Your, Your great returning</segment1>
		<segment2>And my mind starts wondering far away. To when I'll be in a better place</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). 'Cause I am ready for a world. Where my eyes will finally see. Where my heart has longed to be, Jesus. I am ready for a world. When I will kneel before Your throne. And I will hear the words &quot;you are finally home&quot;. I am ready for that world. But for now and until then. I will try and comprehend. How my world will be made new. I'm ready, I'm ready</segment3>
		<segment4>I've been staring at the sky. Looking past the clouds. Wondering if You are just beyond them. I can almost see it now. How everything will change. When You start coming down in a cloud of glory</segment4>
		<segment5>And my mind starts wondering far away. To be where I'll be in a better place</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)    </segment6>
