		<segment1>From this blessed morning. My love constant has been pouring. Pouring out like rivers to Your heart. Glory bells are ringing. I can't keep myself from singing. Singing out like rivers to Your heart </segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, Lord, I have found my place in this home, this home inside of You. And here, my Lord, I can see Your face. In this home, this home inside of You </segment2>
		<segment3>Like a child I'm gazing. Into wondrous grace. For You have been the love that fell like sun upon my face. Like a child I'm gazing. Into wondrous love. You're taking me to places that my heart is dreaming of </segment3>
		<segment4>Broken I was crawling. And You saw my tears were falling. Falling down like rivers to Your heart. When my world was folding. God, You saw my prayers were flowing. Flowing out like rivers to Your heart </segment4>
		<segment5>Hear the sacred songs that touch the earth and the sky. See them rise until they move like stars within Your eyes     </segment5>
