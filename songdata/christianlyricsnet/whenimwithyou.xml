		<segment1>When I hold you. In my arms, love. Somethin' changes. It's the strangest feeling</segment1>
		<segment2>The things that. Use to matter. They don't matter. To me</segment2>
		<segment3>When I see you. And you're smilin'. How my heart aches. So full it is about to break</segment3>
		<segment4>You make me believe in love</segment4>
		<segment5>I could never count all the ways. That you change me, baby. Every day the sky is a deeper shade of blue. When I'm with you</segment5>
		<segment6>When I hear you. And you're cryin'. It resonates, dear. In a place I didn't know was there</segment6>
		<segment7>You make me believe in love</segment7>
		<segment8>I could never count all the ways. That you change me, baby. Every day the sky is a deeper shade of blue. When I'm with you</segment8>
		<segment9>Beautiful, baby. You're sweeter than strawberry pie. Just like the morning. Your smile brings the sun that shines</segment9>
		<segment10>I could never count all the ways. That you change me, baby. Every day the sky is a deeper shade of blue. When I'm with you</segment10>
		<segment11>I could never count all the ways. That you change me, baby. Every day the sky is a deeper shade of blue. When I'm with you    </segment11>
