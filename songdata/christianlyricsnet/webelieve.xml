		<segment1>We believe in the Father, who created all that is. And we believe the universe and all therein is His. As a loving heavenly Father, He yearned to save us all. To lift us from the fall. . We believe</segment1>
		<segment2>We believe in Jesus the Father's only Son. Existing uncreated before time had begun. A sacrifice for sin, He died then rose again. To ransom sinful men, We believe</segment2>
		<segment3>We believe in the spirit who makes believers one. Our hearts are filled with His presence. The Comforter has come. The kingdom unfolds in His plan. Unhindered by quarrels of man. His church upheld by His hand. . We believe</segment3>
		<segment4>Though the earth be removed. And time be no more. These truths are secure. God's word shall endure. Whatever may change, these things are sure. . We believe</segment4>
		<segment5>So if the mountains are cast down into the plains. When kingdoms all crumble, this one remains. Our faith is not subject to seasons of man. With our fathers we proclaim. We believe our Lord will come as he said. The land and the sea will give up their dead. His children will reign with Him as their head</segment5>
		<segment6>We believe. We believe.     </segment6>
