		<segment1>I want to preach the Word. they want massages. I check chapter and verse. they check their watches. I spy another yawn. I might as well be gone. let's stand and say &quot;Amen&quot;. some days I must admit. I still don't get this. could be it's time to quit. when days get like this. I slip into the night. then stumble towards the light. wake up and try again </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. when You called my name. I didn't know how far the calling went. when You called my name. I didn't know what that word really meant. when I recall Your call. I feel. so small </segment2>
		<segment3>could be I'm losing touch. could be they don't care. Lord knows I don't know much. Lord knows I've been there. I trip toward my retreat. I fall down at Your feet. get up and try again </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. when You called my name. I didn't know how far the calling went. when You called my name. I didn't know what that word really meant. when I recall Your call. I feel. so small. Lord, what did you see. when you called out for me? </segment4>
		<segment5>I start losing heart. and then. it comes again. lifted from despair. by the prayers of someone. lifted form despair. by the prayers of someone </segment5>
		<segment6>- Chorus -    </segment6>
