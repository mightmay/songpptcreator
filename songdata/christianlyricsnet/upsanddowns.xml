		<segment1>All that I've found through the ups and downs. Is that I'd have it no other way. Life in the raw is both fragile and strong. It's both lovely and ugly the same. Who can attest that when they're at their best. Oh their worst is still crouching close behind. It's coming to peace with the darkness in me. That allows the true light to shine inside. So let it go, for we are still far from home. Though you try and try to escape. To live and to love will always be dangerous. But it's better than playing it safe. We are composed of a symphony of notes. Every life is as music to His ears. I'll play my melody be it haunting be it sweet. Unashamed of what anyone might hear. So when the load breaks your back and your will. You must still keep your heart in the game. To live and to love will always be dangerous. But it's better than playing it safe. So let it go, when it don't feel like home. When inside is your only escape. To live and to love will always be dangerous. But would you want it any other way?     </segment1>
