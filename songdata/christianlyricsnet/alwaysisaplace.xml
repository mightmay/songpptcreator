		<segment1>Its been awhile and the pictures we had are faded. When the same mistakes brings common truth to what we hated. When one could be empty [and tired of being empty], We gotta be ones who are always there, To know and always care, Always have always, always seize the day, Always look inside, always modify, Always have always, Because always is a place.</segment1>
		<segment2>When its been awhile. And the flowers she gave have withered. When the same mistakes brings. common truth to what weve hated. When one could be empty [and tired of being empty], We gotta be ones who are always. there, to know and always care, Always have always, always seize the day, Always look inside, always modify, Always have always, Because always is a place.</segment2>
		<segment3>And Id like to go there, Where love must grow, Where its all they know. And Id like to see it. Where substance stays. Because thats always. Weve gotta be ones.    </segment3>
