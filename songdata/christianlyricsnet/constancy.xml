		<segment1>How could you love someone like me?. What have I done for you?. All of the times I've turned my back. Things I did not think through. But you still care for me in spite of what you've seen. You shed your blood for me even though I do not deserve your grace. You've shown your faithfulness. Please help me do the same. I am so thankful for my life. I could not ask for more. I don't want to just take up space. I've already wasted so much time. You shed your blood for me even though I do not deserve your grace. You've shown your faithfulness. Please help me do the same.     </segment1>
