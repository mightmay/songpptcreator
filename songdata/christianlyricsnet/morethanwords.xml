		<segment1>Lord, I don't know what to say. As I get down on my knees to pray. The same old phrases come to mind. But You've heard them all a thousand times. It's not that its untrue, when I say &quot;Lord, I love You&quot;. It's just that I want it to be more</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: More than words, I want my prayer to be more than words. Thoughts my heart alone can speak. As You listen to me tell of all your power and mercy. Lord, You know its my desire, that what You hear is more than words</segment2>
		<segment3>As I open up this Book. And read of all the love it took. for a holy God to care for man. Spirit help me understand. It's not that it's unclear, it's a letter to children. But Lord, I know it's meant to be much more</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus II. More than words, not just letters on a page. More than words, for every line and every phrase. Was a breath of inspiration from a caring Father. Who gave the gift of His Son to prove He loved us more than words</segment4>
		<segment5>As I consider quietly the wonder of all Your ability. It's more than I can comprehend, and I find myself in need again. But if I had every word, and a thousand years to use them. What You are to me would still be more, oh, so much more. More than words.     </segment5>
