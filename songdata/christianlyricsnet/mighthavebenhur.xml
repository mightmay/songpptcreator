		<segment1>Everything I know. Tells me she's everything. That I could hope for. Everything I know. Tells me I can't let her walk away </segment1>
		<segment2>I took my time to find the words. I hope she'd feel the same </segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause I want someone to share my smile. To share the pain. To be there when the sea turns gray. To share the joy. For better or worse </segment3>
		<segment4>{chorus}: And I thought that it might have been her. I thought that it might have been her </segment4>
		<segment5>Wonder if she knows. The way I saw her soul. Light up my life. Wonder if she knows. of the pain I feel tonight    </segment5>
