		<segment1>Hey mister, where are you going to come in from?. Is everyone just as scared?. Push me away, you don't know me or want to. Your separation from yourself makes you feel good</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't run so fast, it doesn't last. It's not your fault you stay away. I've only myself to blame. I can't change those yesterdays. So let's right the wrongs. Everyone belongs</segment2>
		<segment3>All of the hatred and phobias are stemming. From gifts that you didn't earn. {You don't deserve}. Like little children defining the outcast. You insure they'll never return. How will you learn?</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't think so fast, they never ask. You stay inside, they stay away. We've only ourselves to blame. For the mass-production of shame. And we right the wrongs. Everyone belongs</segment4>
		<segment5>There's room for me and you. There's room for me and you</segment5>
		<segment6>We've only ourself to blame. We can't change those yesterdays. So let's right the wrongs. Everyone belongs     </segment6>
