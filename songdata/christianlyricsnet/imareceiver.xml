		<segment1>I thought God was only Jewish fairy tales. Meant for someone else with lots more faith. All my doubts depressed me. That's the way it stayed. Till a voice said, Honey, call my name. Then I got His grace -- now I'm a receiver. God replaced -- the doubt in my mind -- I've been loved. I'm a receiver -- Got the Redeemer in my life. I thought God was more impressed with givin' things. He said, Boy, I gave the best I got. What's the use in strivin'? All your debt is paid. Didn't leave a punchline on My grave. Then I got His grace -- now I'm a receiver. Got a place -- a palace on high -- up above. I'm a receiver -- I'm gonna be there if I die. What's the use in strivin? All your debt is paid. Check out Romans 10:9 -- I got saved. When I got His grace -- now I'm a receiver. Mama says -- I'm out of my mind -- I've been touched. I'm a receiver -- I got Ephesians 2:8,9. Then I got His grace -- now I'm a receiver. Not afraid -- about when I die. Now I'm a receiver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah    </segment1>
