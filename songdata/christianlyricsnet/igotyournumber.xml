		<segment1>I got your number. where love can be found. I got your number. where truth can be found. I asked you in one day. and you came into my life. I got your number. for the rest of my life</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I can feel your love. flowing out to me. each day and night. I can see clearly now. I see your eyes in the starry skies. I can feel your life flowing out to me. with each breath I take. I can see clearly now. your Spirit has shown me the perfect way</segment2>
		<segment3>I got your number. and I'm happy to say. you set my heart on fire. with every move you make. when you walk into a room. it lights up with your grace. I got your number now. it's the hot line to your place</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>bridge: you say you say you want. you say you say you want. you say you say you want to be free.</segment5>
		<segment6>you want you want you want. you want you want you want. you want you want you want to be free.</segment6>
		<segment7>you can you can you can. you can you can you can. you can you can you can be free.</segment7>
		<segment8>I got your number. it's written deep within my heart. you filled that emptiness. and lighted up a new part. there's much more to life. than other numbers on the wall. I got you number. it's burning deep within my soul</segment8>
		<segment9>Repeat Chorus..    </segment9>
