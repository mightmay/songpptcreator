		<segment1>One of our most ambitious attempts to date, we incorporated a lot of elements that we'd been trying to use for a while. The group vocals are a group of guys from the label who came over and had a blast with us in the studio one day.</segment1>
		<segment2>My heart is tired. of feeling suffering. My mind keeps wondering. who I should be</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, so alone</segment3>
		<segment4>With no one here for me. I feel so dead. You whispered in the dark, and you said, you said</segment4>
		<segment5>No, No, never alone</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been thinking about. The paths that my life. has gone down. I've pushed a crown. of thorns in my brow. To show my salvation. worked out. With all the knowledge. I had learned. Anchored to righteousness. I'd earned. Now I've gone the other way. Depended too heavily on grace. I need a reprieve. A point between extremes    </segment6>
