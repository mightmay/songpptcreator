		<segment1>It's getting colder, I'm getting pale. You're asking questions I wouldn't dare. The floor is creaking beneath my feet. You're so enlightened it's killing me</segment1>
		<segment2>Can hardly hear you from on the floor. Your hesitation is my reward. You want an answer from me tonight. I couldn't tell you to save my life</segment2>
		<segment3>Why we're even hear after all this time. I'll never understand, you'll never realize</segment3>
		<segment4>In our reflection I can see. You look so lonely next to me. You always swept it underneath</segment4>
		<segment5>Why we're even hear after all this time. I'll never understand, you'll never realize</segment5>
		<segment6>In our reflection I can see. You look so lonely next to me. You always swept it underneath</segment6>
		<segment7>And it's getting very near the end. And I'm wondering what it might have been. If you believe in that sort of thing you ought to know. I'm pulling back and letting go    </segment7>
