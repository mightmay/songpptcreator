		<segment1>Sleigh bells ring, are you listening, In the lane, snow is glistening. A beautiful sight, We're happy tonight. Walking in a winter wonderland.</segment1>
		<segment2>Gone away is the bluebird, Here to stay is a new bird. He sings a love song, As we go along, Walking in a winter wonderland.</segment2>
		<segment3>In the meadow we can build a snowman, Then pretend that he is Parson Brown</segment3>
		<segment4>He'll say: Are you married?. We'll say: No man, But you can do the job. When you're in town.</segment4>
		<segment5>Later on, we'll conspire, As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid, The plans that we've made, Walking in a winter wonderland.</segment5>
		<segment6>Later on, we'll conspire, As we dream by the fire. To face unafraid, The plans that we've made, Walking in a winter wonderland. We'll go walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland. Walking in a winter wonderland. We'll go walking, walking in a winter wonderland. Hey, yeah, yeah, winter wonderland.     </segment6>
