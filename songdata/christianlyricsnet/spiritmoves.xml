		<segment1>If you open up your heart, open up your mind. If you give it all away what you will find. Throw your hands up in the air and close your eyes and you. Can never get enough. Of the love and the power you'll receive. When you fall down and you hit your knees. So amazing what your eyes will see if you're ready. When the spirit moves</segment1>
		<segment2>I, I can feel the Spirit, when it moves down in my soul. As it comes to make me whole. I, I can feel the power, as it washes over me. As it comes to set me free. I glow, nothing can erase the healing, nothing can replace the feeling. I know, it's a real move deep inside, and it's too diving to hide</segment2>
		<segment3>I, I can feel the Spirit, when we bow our heads in prayer, let. The Lord just take us there. And I know, ain't nothing quite the same, as the fire that's in. The place, when you call upon His Name, I'm telling you. (Can't run, and you can't hide) No need to try at all. (It'll bring a change inside) When the anointing falls. (Don't need no other high) Can't get no higher I know. (Don't let it pass you by) Let the Lord take control</segment3>
		<segment4>Ooh and when the Spirit falls, you hear Him call. You know you should answer. Go ahead let go (Let God) Take control, of your soul. Know there's nothing better</segment4>
		<segment5>When the spirit falls, let go, let God, just take control. You know you should answer, cause you. (Can't run, and you can't hide) No need to try at all. (It'll bring a change inside) When the anointing falls. (Don't need no other high) Can't get no higher I know. (Don't let it pass you by) Let the Lord take control    </segment5>
