		<segment1>Marie Marie. Playing guitar on the back porch. I sit in my car. While she sings so sad. Marie Marie. It's so lonely in these farmlands. Please come with me. To the bright lights downtown. Marie Marie. I said, &quot;Hey, pretty girl Don't you understand. I just want to be your loving man&quot;. Marie Marie. The sun is down in the corn fields. The evening is dark. And you sing so sad. Marie Marie </segment1>
		<segment2>Marie Marie. I got two weeks in back pay. There's gas in my car. And your folks say I must go. I said, &quot;Hey, pretty girl Don't you understand. I just want to be your loving man&quot;. Marie Marie. Marie Marie. Playing guitar on the back porch. I leave in my car. While you sing so sad. Marie Marie.     </segment2>
