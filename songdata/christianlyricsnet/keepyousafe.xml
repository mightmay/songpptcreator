		<segment1>Quiet your heart. Its just a dream. Go back to sleep</segment1>
		<segment2>Ill be right here. Ill stay awake as long as you need me. To slay all the dragons. And keep out the monsters. Im watching over you</segment2>
		<segment3>My love is a light. Driving away all of your fear. So dont be afraid. Remember I made a promise to keep you safe</segment3>
		<segment4>Youll have your own battles to fight. When you are older. Youll find yourself frozen inside. But always remember</segment4>
		<segment5>If you feel alone. Facing the giants. And you dont know. What to do</segment5>
		<segment6>My love is a light. Driving away all of your fear. So dont be afraid. Remember I made a promise to keep you safe.     </segment6>
