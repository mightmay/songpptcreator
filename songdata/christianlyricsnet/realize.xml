		<segment1>Intimidation has put me thru what I need to. Stand up to you don't protest I've made up. My mind I've got to leave it all behind I. Believed so many times your deceit too. Many lies my hope for you in decadence. Can't replace what's torn apart it took me. Such a long time to realize I was an instutution. For you go where you want to go know who. You want to know now I know that I was. Lied to sometimes I see your lighter side. The part of you try to hide it's true you. Still don't seem to care never a word only. A stare no one has ever known you you. Don't even know yourself your best friend's. Your enemy too what else can I say to you. It took me such a long time to realize I was. An instutution for you go where you want. To go know who you want to know now I know. That I was lied to</segment1>
