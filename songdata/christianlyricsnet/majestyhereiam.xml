		<segment1>Here I am humbled by your Majesty. Covered by your grace so free. Here I am, knowing I'm a sinful man. Covered by the blood of the Lamb</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine. Since you laid down your life. The greatest sacrifice</segment2>
		<segment3>Majesty, Majesty. Your grace has found me just as I am. Empty handed, but alive in your hands. Majesty, Majesty. Forever I am changed by your love. In the presence of your Majesty</segment3>
		<segment4>Here I am humbled by the love that you give. Forgiven so that I can forgive. Here I stand, knowing that I'm your desire. Sanctified by glory and fire</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I've found the greatest love of all is mine. Since you laid down your life. The greatest sacrifice    </segment5>
