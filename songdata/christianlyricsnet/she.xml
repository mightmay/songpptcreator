		<segment1>vs1. everybody follows her around. she takes up their burdens like a crown. youre invisible when shes around</segment1>
		<segment2>ch. shes got it all together. she has no alibi. shes lighter than a feather. she never tells a lie. she gives it up so easily in love. shes got it all together</segment2>
		<segment3>vs2. she does everything you know you should. all your chivalry does her no good. shes undoing all the things youve done</segment3>
		<segment4>ch</segment4>
		<segment5>bridge. whether you love, or whether you hate. you have to deal with her. shell ruin youre life. but shell stay by your side. so she can pour the drinks. she knows who you are. but shell argue your case. if you confess to her. and wear her dress tonight</segment5>
		<segment6>ch    </segment6>
