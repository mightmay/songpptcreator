		<segment1>I have noticed things about myself. It seems they never stay under the rug. I've swept them too. I don't know how I have gone on for so long. If only I could hide them someplace they would stay. And all this time I was wrong. You have been there everyday. I never gave the credit that was due and hiding is not the way. I don't need to focus on what has passed. My life will not be hide and seek. But I will seek the truth in all I do in every trial I face. I'll seek the truth. I'll seek the truth.</segment1>
