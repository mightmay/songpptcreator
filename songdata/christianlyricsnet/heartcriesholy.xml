		<segment1>Standing here in the presence. Of something more than merely real. There are no words to describe you. Or explain the way I feel</segment1>
		<segment2>As you speak I find healing for my soul. And your touch alone can make me whole</segment2>
		<segment3>And my heart cries Holy. And my spirit feels the change. As my heart cries Holy I will never be the same</segment3>
		<segment4>Your mercies toward me last forever. Your faithfulness is true. And as You touch the coal to my lips. My mind is made brand new</segment4>
		<segment5>I could never repay all that You've done. So use my life to the glory of Your Son</segment5>
		<segment6>Everything inside me. Everything untrue. Oh Lord I surrender. All of it to You    </segment6>
