		<segment1>I see your eyes x-ray my insides. You're screaming death to me, waiting for me to die. I see your eyes x-ray my insides. The rockstar autopsy. You need what used to be. I see your eyes x-ray my insides. A stubborn glance, a chance to watch me all unwind. I see your eyes x-ray my insides. I wish you'd grab my hand cause we're falling fast.</segment1>
		<segment2>You and me &quot; looks like the last time we hold hands.</segment2>
		<segment3>I want you back. I need you back.</segment3>
		<segment4>I see your eyes x-ray my insides. This pedestal for me is getting way too high. I see your eyes x-ray my insides. So either watch me fall or watch me die. I see your eyes x-ray my insides. A stubborn glance, a chance to watch me all unwind. I see your eyes x-ray my insides. I wish I had your hand, cause we're falling fast.</segment4>
		<segment5>You and me &quot; looks like the last time we hold hands.</segment5>
		<segment6>I want you back. I need you back.</segment6>
		<segment7>X-ray my inside. Cause we're falling fast.</segment7>
		<segment8>Looks like the last time we hold hands. Looks like the last time we hold hands. Looks like the last time. Looks like the last time.     </segment8>
