		<segment1>You caught me on my way to destroy stages. You stopped me, bitter-faced, to ask me this: &quot;Yo, I don't understand your agitation. Why can't you write a track that's sensitive?&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>It isn't. Because I. Just didn't think about it. It isn't. Because I. Just can't</segment2>
		<segment3>Little man. I wish I could</segment3>
		<segment4>You took a step back when I strarted howling. You turned and told your friends with hostile frowns. &quot;This dude is furious I don't quite get it. I wonder why he doesn't just calm down.&quot;</segment4>
		<segment5>It isn't. Because I. Just didn't think about it. It isn't. Because I. Just can't</segment5>
		<segment6>Little girl. I wish I could</segment6>
		<segment7>I made my way back to the merch booth after. A man confronts me, smiling ear to ear. The sweat is dripping from his face in gallons. And all he wants to do is shake my hand. (Then he) stops to tell me he'd be six feet under. That's if it wasn't for our caveman jams.     </segment7>
