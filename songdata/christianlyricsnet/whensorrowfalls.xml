		<segment1>it's okay to say i love you. it's okay for you to cry. the sorrow that you are feeling you should not deny. so why is it so trying to express the way i feel?. just one moment you steal. i still care and i still feel. time and again. it's all too real. separate and detached. myself running from all the pain i felt. questioning the way I am and the things with which i've dealt. somewhere in the foothills of my mind. i know my ways just aren't right. they're not right. so i'll shrug it off and wear a grin. i'll carry on and just pretend. i still care. i still feel. time and again. it's all too real    </segment1>
