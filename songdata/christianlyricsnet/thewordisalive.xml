		<segment1>Looking out from His throne, the Father of light and of men. Chose to make Himself known and show us the way back to Him. Speaking wisdom and truth into the hearts of peasants and kings. He began to unveil the Word that would change the course of all things</segment1>
		<segment2>With eyes wide open, all would see</segment2>
		<segment3>The Word is alive. And it cuts like a sword through the darkness. With a message of life to the hopeless and afraid. Breathing life into all who believe. The Word is alive. And the world and its glories will fade. But His truth, it will not pass away. It remains yesterday and forever the same. The Word is alive</segment3>
		<segment4>Simple strokes on a page. Eternity's secrets revealed, carried on from age to age. It speaks Truth to us even still. And as the rain falls from Heaven, feeds the earth before it returns. Lord, let Your Word fall on us and bring forth the fruit You deserve</segment4>
		<segment5>With eyes wide open, let us see</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus). *PERSON ON MEGA PHONE*. The Bible was inscribed over a period of 2000 years. In times of War and Days of Peace. By Kings, Physician, Tax Collectors, Farmers, Fisherman, Singers and Shepherds. The Marvel is that a library so perfectly cohesive. To be produced by a diverse crowd. Over a period of time, which stagers the imagination. Jesus is his greatest Subject. Our good is designed and Glory of GOD is its Greatest end. (Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>The Word is alive. His Word is alive.     </segment7>
