		<segment1>How we do groan to be released from the confines of earthly mortality. To live is Christ to die is gain. We will be free from this earthly frame. Lord how we long to meet you in the air. The dead shall rise first, the living, death shall spare. Eternally changed, these cloths shall be shed Mortal Stomp, the resurrection of the dead. Instantly changed to incorruption. Those who reject Him will taste separation. The ground it shall open (and) awaken those who sleep. The Earth in birth pains shall give up her deceased. Spirit and body will be reunited. Death has lost it's sting, the grave its victory. Eternally changed, these cloths shall be shed, Mortal Stomp, the resurrection of the dead. Death, Separation, Life, Resurrection. (2x). Stomp! Stomp! Stomp! (3x). We shall not sleep, but we shall be changed. In a moment the last trump shall sound. No more sickness and no more tears, no more pain and no more fears. This hope we hold will soon come to pass. Thanks be to God for the victory at last!. Eternally changed, these cloths shall be shed, Mortal Stomp, the resurrection of the dead. Death, Separation, Life, Resurrection. (2x). Solo-Steve. How we do groan to be released from the confines of earthly mortality. To live is Christ to die is gain. We will be free from this earthly frame. Lord how we long to meet you in the air. The dead shall rise first, the living, death shall spare. Eternally changed, these cloths shall be shed. Mortal Stomp, the resurrection of the dead. Death, Separation, Life, Resurrection. (2x) STOMP!.     </segment1>
