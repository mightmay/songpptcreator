		<segment1>are you the wonderful creator the one and only son. God becoming man bringing salvation to everyone. are you the messiah the risen and living Lord. did you die for me on a tree paying the price i can't afford. Jesus, Jesus. surrounded by your glory. maker of all nations. how can i ignore thee. in the midst of your creation. and i want to know you, i want to know you. i want to know you, i want to know you. and i want to love you, i want to love you. better than i do right now right now. just show me how right now. and Holy Holy is the Lord almighty. Holy Holy is his name. your kingdom come your will be done. on this earth as it is in heaven. your kingdom come your will be done. in my life.     </segment1>
