		<segment1>It's hard for me to trust you. It's hard for you to love me, the way I love you girl. She tells him that she loves. him and she's only thinking of him. At least that's what she said last night.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: True love, true love, it's coming down to haunt you. You will never feel the same and only you are to blame. The days go by and he feels the same. but she will flood his mind with childish games. Truth. The thought of having someone. that you can always depend on. You are heartless and you make me sick girl.    </segment2>
