		<segment1>Lost, my heart is hard as stone. On my own, alone I carry it home. Gone, I used to waste the days. So distraught, I thought Im changing my ways. Now youre changing my ways</segment1>
		<segment2>You save me, save me from myself. There is no one else Id lean on. Save me, you save me from myself. There is no one else to set me free</segment2>
		<segment3>Start, the start of something new. Is what I find when Im just looking at you. Lift, you lift me off the ground. Keep holding my hand, I wont land, wont even look down. Dont look down. Dont look down    </segment3>
