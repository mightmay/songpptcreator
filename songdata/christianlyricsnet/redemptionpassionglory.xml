		<segment1>This is redemption, that you would die for me. And this is salvation, that you would live in me. That you would live in me. This is redemption, this salvation. This is our mission, and this is our passion </segment1>
		<segment2>What love is this. That you would die for me?. (Let's start this over). What love is this? </segment2>
		<segment3>This is redemption, that you would die for me. And this is salvation, that you would live in me. That you would live in me. This is rejection, that they would all hate me. And this is submission. that I would live holy. That I would live holy </segment3>
		<segment4>What love is this. That you would die for me?. (Let's start this over). Let's start this over and we'll see. Just where this love will take us. Your presence shows us grace. Right here in our own meditation. What love is this? </segment4>
		<segment5>Creation finds your mercy. Redemption, passion, glory. Creation finds submission. Redemption, passion, glory.     </segment5>
