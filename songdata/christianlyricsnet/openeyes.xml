		<segment1>A man walks down the street. Snd we close our eyes. Because he is filthy and homeless. So we don't even look twice. Under his arm ther's a Bible and. A look of peace in his eyes. This man also loves Jesus, so. Just open up your eyes. Love your brother, any form. Shape, and size because no one. Looks perfect except in Jesus' eyes. Take time to know your brothers. And open up their eyes. A boy sleeps under a bridge. Mad from the world's lies. he sees you, Preaching to the crowd, and comes to seek Jesus Christ. And when you tell him about the Lord. You will see the fear in his eyes.. Jesus tugging at his heart. The Lord opened up his eyes.. We go through life with our eyes closed. And we turn off the people who need us the most. We gotta take time to know one another. We gotta take time to love all our brothers    </segment1>
