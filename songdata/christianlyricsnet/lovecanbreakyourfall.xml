		<segment1>Don't turn away. Just say what you need to say. You're not alone. But you got to move on, got to let go. When the passion surrenders. When the dream you share is longer than. I know it hurts so much. Tell me, how in the world can you blame it on love?</segment1>
		<segment2>And don't say its love that broke your heart. When you trusted someone. Cuz love's the victim not the crime. And love will be there to break your fall. If you trust in love. Know that love would never, break your heart. Love can break your fall</segment2>
		<segment3>I know, it's hard to trust again. I'll stay with you, stay with me now. Let go of your heartache. Learn to forgive. Won't you wait just a moment. Give your heart a chance to begin again. And though you run before. Tell me, where will you go if you walk out that door?</segment3>
		<segment4>And don't say its love that broke your heart. When you trusted someone. Cuz love's the victim not the crime. And love will be there to break your fall. If you trust in love, just in love. Know that love would never, break your heart. Love can break your fall</segment4>
		<segment5>I could never have found my own way. It was God's love that saved this heart of mine from dying. And when you find this love is all that you have. Then you'll see love is all that you need</segment5>
		<segment6>And don't say it's love that broke your heart. When it's over and done. Believe in love forever. And love will be there to break your fall. If you trust in love, just in love. Know that love would never, break your heart. Love can break your fall.     </segment6>
