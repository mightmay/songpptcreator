		<segment1>Put your hands up open up wide.  Put your hands up side by side.  Age dont matter like.  Race dont matter like.  Place dont matter like whats inside</segment1>
		<segment2> Let the kick drum kick one time.  Breathe out let your mind unwind.  Eyes on the ceiling.  Looking for the feeling.  Wide open let your own eyes shine</segment2>
		<segment3> Yeah, its where the fight begins.  Yeah, underneath the skin.  Between these hopes and where weve been.  Every fight comes from the fight within</segment3>
		<segment4> - Chorus .  I am the war inside.  I am the battle line.  I am the rising tide.  I am the war I fight</segment4>
		<segment5> Eyes open open wide.  I can feel it like a crack in my spine.  I can feel it like the back of my mind.  I am the war inside</segment5>
		<segment6> I get the feeling that were living in sci-fi.  I get the the feeling that our weapons are lo-fi.  Aint no killer like pride.  No killer like I.  No killer like whats inside</segment6>
		<segment7> Yeah, its in the air we breathe.  Yeah, its in the blood we bleed.  Beneath these dreams and what weve seen.  We are the kids of the in-between</segment7>
		<segment8> Put your hands up open up wide.  put your hands up side by side.  Age dont matter like.  Race dont matter like.  Place dont matter like whats inside</segment8>
		<segment9> Yeah, every thought or deed.  Yeah, every tree or seed.  The big things come from the little dreams.  Every world is made by make believe    </segment9>
