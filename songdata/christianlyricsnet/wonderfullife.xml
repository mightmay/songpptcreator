		<segment1>Beautiful is in the sky. Watch it slowly. All our time is flying by, too fast. Where we're headed is so clear. To somewhere higher. And anything we want is here, right now</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause the sun is shining. And the world is alive..and</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Everything's all right. And all you ever needed. It's a perfect day to be alive. So no more waiting now. For a wonderful life. 'Cause it's a wonderful life right now</segment3>
		<segment4>Beautiful is in the eyes. Of a friend or a stranger. Souls searching in disguise, for love. We're all planning our escape. To something higher. Looking for a better way to feel</segment4>
		<segment5>But the sun is shining. And the whole wide world is alive</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus]</segment6>
