		<segment1>Only He knows we eat and drink. As if tomorrow is a breath away. Voice of this generation. Speaks with great force. We scream for the hour to (arrive). We will never know when You will show. The moment of defeat. Like we never knew when You would choose to gather all your sheep. Only he knows we beg to be divided. When two become one. One left in the field, one left at the mill. We devour this opportunity. To give penance. To spread the light of truth. As we fall asleep, the Shepherd divides his sheep. The thief will arrive. Your key in his pocket. He robs you blind    </segment1>
