		<segment1>Gone away far from home, the weekend's over. Let's pack up and start again. Twenty days on the road, just left Port Dover. With sixteen days to go</segment1>
		<segment2>I just called my mom to tell her that I miss her. I just wrote my girl. Man I can't remember the last time I kissed her. Soon I'll be at home with all my friends. After thirty-six days on the road</segment2>
		<segment3>Lights go down the noise has faded. We'll leave this town anticipated. Soon we'll be back on the road again. All is lost, but not forgotten. One by one the fights we've fought. And soon we'll be back on the road again. For thirty-six days</segment3>
		<segment4>We turn around, face the crowd. We're starting over. This time north of L.A. Once again here we are. It's a new beginning. I'd leave this life any day</segment4>
		<segment5>I feel so alive, though part of me is gone. And this life I lead, is the life that I've dreamed of. Since I was the age of twelve. Now I'll sing with all this is within me. After thirty-six days on the road</segment5>
		<segment6>Lights go down the noise has faded. We leave this town anticipated. Soon we'll be back on the road again. All is lost, but not forgotten. One by one the fights we've fought. And soon we'll be back on the road again. And soon we'll be back on the road again. Soon we'll be back on the road again. For thirty-six days     </segment6>
