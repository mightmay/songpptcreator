		<segment1>I want to go deeper. But I don't know how to swim. I want to be meeker. But have you seen this old earth?. I want to fly higher. But these arms won't take me there. I want to be, I want to be</segment1>
		<segment2>Maybe I could run. Maybe I could fly, to you. Do you feel the same. When all you see is. Blame in me?</segment2>
		<segment3>And the wonder of it all is that I'm living just to fall. More in love with you [x2]</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to go deeper. But is it just a stupid whim?. I want to be weaker. Be a help to the strong. I want to run faster. But this old leg won't carry me. I want to be, I want to be</segment4>
		<segment5>Maybe I could run. Maybe I could fly, to you. Do you feel the same. When all you see is. Blame in me?</segment5>
		<segment6>And the wonder of it all is that I'm living just to fall. More in love with you [x2]</segment6>
		<segment7>Maybe I could run. Maybe I could follow. It's time to walk the path. Where many seem to fall. Hold me in your arms. Just like any father would. How long do we have to wait?. How long, we're going all way</segment7>
		<segment8>And the wonder of it all is that I'm living just to fall. More in love with you    </segment8>
