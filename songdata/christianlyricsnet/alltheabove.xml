		<segment1>Stuck in a day. Like a runner with no race. Are you afraid. Your joy has been misplaced. It's been a while. Since I've seen you smile. How easy you forget. So roll back the time. And there you will find. What never left</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: The day heaven found you. The day the angels sang. Praises to the Father. Who called you by name. The moment you surrendered. The moment you were saved. Life as you knew it forever was changed. And all the above rejoiced</segment2>
		<segment3>Remember the day. When God forgot your sin. Remember the way. That joy came tumbling in. There will be times. When you cannot find. A reason to stand and sing. But let this remind. You time after time. You're a child of the King</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>See them dancing. See them singing. All of heaven is rejoicing over you</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus 2x)    </segment6>
