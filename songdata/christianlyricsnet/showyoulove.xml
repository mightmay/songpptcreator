		<segment1>Please forgive me. If I come on too strong. I get a little anxious. When I talk about God's love. Hold me back now. Stop me if I start to preach. 'Cause I don't want to be the one. To push you out of reach</segment1>
		<segment2>The way to give love. Is how you live love. That is what I'll do. You cannot fight it. You can't deny it. Love will get to you</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Don't wanna get up in your face. Don't wanna put the pressure on. Don't wanna make you run away. Just wanna show you love. Don't wanna beg you to believe. Don't wanna take you for a ride. Don't wanna sell you anything. Just wanna show you love. Show you love. Just wanna show you love</segment3>
		<segment4>I won't convince you. With anything I say. But maybe you will see His love. In how it is portrayed. An act of kindness. A loving sacrifice. Simple little things that have. The power to change your life</segment4>
		<segment5>There's no surprises. And no disguises. Just the blessed truth. No obligation. No complication. Just a gift for you.    </segment5>
