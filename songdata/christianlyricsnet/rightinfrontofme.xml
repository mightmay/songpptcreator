		<segment1>Some say weve all been searching for a God for years in vain. And some say belief is just the easy way around our pain. And sometimes Id like to agree when theyre telling me that this is all an accident. Cause its hard to let this heart believe when my mind is screaming out I need more evidence</segment1>
		<segment2>But do I really need more evidence?</segment2>
		<segment3>I want a miracle, something impossible. So would you help me to believe. When You say everything thats right in front of me. Is all the proof Ill ever need</segment3>
		<segment4>I hear it in the winter wind that blows the icy snow against my skin. And I see it in that summer sun that rises high and then burns out again. And I feel it in my chest in the quiet moments that I trust in what You say</segment4>
		<segment5>Would you help me trust in what You say?</segment5>
		<segment6>[ Josh Wilson Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]. Maybe this is what it means to question You and still believe. To search and still be satisfied, to know and yet to wonder why. To put my faith things I doubt, to love what I cant figure out. Maybe this is what it means</segment6>
		<segment7>To want a miracle, something impossible. But have the faith to still believe. When You say everything thats right in front of me. Is all the proof Ill ever need. Dont need a miracle, something impossible. That makes You easy to believe. When You say everything thats right in front of me. Is all the proof Ill ever need</segment7>
		<segment8>Youre all the proof Ill ever need. So would you help me to believe    </segment8>
