		<segment1>From unknown books come printed discoveries. Enlightenment, recoveries. After the words have been read from memory. The secrets start assembling</segment1>
		<segment2>Timber colony. Ageless melodies. Timber colony. Books of memories</segment2>
		<segment3>Horns blow as we greet. In sight of good company. The forest entertains our thoughts. Fond ones that dream of richness and splendor. The wood beckons for us to sing     </segment3>
