		<segment1>I built a fortress. With a hundred thousand faces. I'll keep it safe. With a hundred thousand more. But these masks are wearing thin. As You draw me in</segment1>
		<segment2>I spent my time. On the empty and the fleeting. I spent my life. On much less than I'd dreamed. But I'm reaching out to you. To make me new</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause I am just a beggar here at Your door. I am just a shipwreck here on Your shore. I come empty handed. Ready to see. Your life in me changing who I've been. To who I need to be</segment3>
		<segment4>You tell me my story. As You sift between the pages. I feel redemption. In the space between each turn</segment4>
		<segment5>Could You take me in Your arms. And tell it just once more. Could You take me in Your arms. And tell it just once more    </segment5>
