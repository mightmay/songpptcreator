		<segment1>Lower the flag again. The color white never seemed so justifying. How does it feel to be on the horns of a bull. When will you learn that I dont back down.</segment1>
		<segment2>The thoughts that run my mind still give me the chills. Redeeming sorrow, but still you continue. So patch up the holes in yourself and press onward.. and press onward. The frays of the rope are pulling you deeper. Your lucky compass is failing you now.</segment2>
		<segment3>Set your sites, set your sites on north, and show the world what youre made of.. what youre made of. Make your move, make your mark on the world, and show them what youre made of.. what youre made of. Set your sites, set your sites on north, and show the world what youre made of.. what youre made of. Make your move, make your mark on the world, and show them what youre made of.. what youre made of.</segment3>
		<segment4>Make your move, make your mark this time. Theres no second chance, this is not a test, this is your life. Make your move, make your mark this time. Theres no second chance, this is not a test, this is your life.</segment4>
		<segment5>Make your move... Make your move, make your mark this time. Make your move, make your mark this time.    </segment5>
