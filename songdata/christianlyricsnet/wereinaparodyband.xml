		<segment1>I went and wrote some parodies. Karl tried a little rock, put me on a stage. Keith sleeps comedy, we threw him in the act. Bill adds some more soul and has a knack for chat. We're all four guys with many dreams. But God can help you focus these things. Music lyrics we rewrite. As long as we can take a tune and show the light. We're in a parody band. We're here to share with the fans. We've got a two-part style. We'll tell you part's Weird Al. The other part's Billy Graham. Four Aquafinas and soda pop. We're waiting for the van to return from the shop. Philadelphia late at night its battery died. The hotel we slept in it was highly priced. Now seeing as I'm waiting, I have a plan. Would you like to meet the boys in the band. I'm J.  Karl's the dude with the guitar on. And we've got Keith on the bass and Bill on drums. We're in a parody band. We're in a terrible van. We're comin to your town. And if your car breaks down. We're good Samaritans, man. We're in a parody band. The Bible's there in your hand. You're thumbin' through yours now. We'll help you start it out. With a one-year reading plan . We're in a parody band. We're into prayer and defense. We're from a two-sport town. Three if the Pirates count. It's just so rare that we win. We're in a parody band. We're at a charity dance. We're only two doors down. We know it's Shark Week now. But please come there if you can. Were in a parody band  whoo!. Were in Bob Flahertys band  whoo!. Will this hilarity end  whoo!     </segment1>
