		<segment1>Wherever the wind blows, You will find me there. Standing exactly where I wanna be</segment1>
		<segment2>I hear a Voice in the autumn breeze telling me that I need to leave. But I can't fly with these broken wings. The leaves, they move like poetry, it's all still such a mystery. But I can finally hear the Melody</segment2>
		<segment3>I've been here for so long, I think it's time I moved on. So tell me where it is that I need to be</segment3>
		<segment4>Wasting time here is killing me, waiting here for the Remedy. So I can hear the sound of angels sing</segment4>
		<segment5>I need Something to carry me to a Place that I've never seen. 'Cause right here I've seen all there is to see</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been here for so long, I think its time I moved on. So tell me where it is that I need to be</segment6>
		<segment7>I've been waiting, waiting for the day. So can You carry me away?. You elevate me, how far can You take me, carry me away?.     </segment7>
