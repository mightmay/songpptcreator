		<segment1>Im still stitching up the stabs you left, weaving in and out slowly. I grow accustomed to the piercing flesh, and find evil in the holy. And still, I see the line between the stars, your scars, and mine. And as this coarse thread pulls, I feel the veins of the frozen. </segment1>
		<segment2>Stay in coma. Its the only defense we have left. </segment2>
		<segment3>A bad decision leaves me open and Im left here shuttered for days. If I could replay the words we said, Id see you all amazed. And still its not enough  save yourself and demonize us. And as your curtain draws, they see the tears of the fallen. </segment3>
		<segment4>Stay in coma. Its the only defense we have left. </segment4>
		<segment5>Im not taking the fall for a spineless puppet. You play quiet, and I wont fight it. </segment5>
		<segment6>Stay in coma. Its the only defense we have left.     </segment6>
