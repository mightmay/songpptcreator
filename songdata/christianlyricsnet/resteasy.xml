		<segment1>One more mile 'til I lay rest. I have put myself through this rigid test. But the mile has never ended no distance has been gained. I do not see greatness I wanted to obtain. Where is my embrace from the race that I have run?. I have kept a steady pace but still I have not won </segment1>
		<segment2>Rest easy. have no fear. I love you perfectly. love drives out fear. I'll take your burden. you take My grace. Rest easy. in My embrace </segment2>
		<segment3>I am such a sinner I fear my evil ways. I fear my imperfection I fear my final days. I just want to take control and snap this rusty chain. drop my heavy burden it seems to be in vain </segment3>
		<segment4>Rest easy. have no fear. I love you perfectly. love drives out fear. I'll take your burden. you take My grace. Rest easy. in My embrace </segment4>
		<segment5>I am not a bold man even though I want to be. I am just a dreamer with a timid history. Scared of confrontations I fume all through the night. the world has it's hold on me and I just want to fly. The sky, the sky is open wide. but I can't fly 'til I step aside </segment5>
		<segment6>Rest easy. have no fear. I love you perfectly. and perfect love drives out fear. I'll take your burden. you take My grace. Rest easy. in My embrace. Rest easy, rest easy. rest easy, in My embrace. Rest easy     </segment6>
