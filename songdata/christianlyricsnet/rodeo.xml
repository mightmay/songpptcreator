		<segment1>Intro: Yo Mana you ready man, youre on in 5 minutes dude, Get your stuff get your DJ and go kill it </segment1>
		<segment2>Im like blow. Step out on the stage like Im infamous. Sound of a thousand kids screaming all into it. Like you no my name? Or even know my songs (What!!) Adlibs. They even no the lyrics to chant and sing along (uh huh). Its like eh yo, He got that style. Im like yeah yall, its going down. Emceeing with freedom Im seeing. Kids freaking the feeling of reaping the seeds and Im speaking. And I like that, Im a still rap. I wont come fake styling like ye plastic gats. If you didnt know I spit the syllables. Were bringing you Manafest style live at the rodeo, radio, video, stereo here we go </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Ive traveled all over the globe. Whats under ye nose. Rip the shows if its sunny or snows. Sell it to the rich feed it to the poor and you know. Its Kodak moments up live in stereo </segment3>
		<segment4>Rodeo, Radio, Video, Stereo </segment4>
		<segment5>Stage dive off a lyrical high without the red eyes. Spiritual miracle signs through the man I. Serve with the most respect, I dont boast to get. 6 zero checks survival of the fittest. People diss ye, people like ye. Battle freestyle you. Whos wiser? You a rhymer?. Hope ye have your lyrical chops top notch. Before you get sling shotted off the mic and cut. Its a cold game pick up ye flow man. You better have skills plus an ill business plan. Get thick skin or gain a lot of weight. This is hip hop/ rockn roll rodeo lets go!!!! </segment5>
		<segment6>Big crowds to small crowds, any crowd. We go town to town, bust many styles. People smiling all across the island. Kick freestyles till yall buck wilding. My jeans is still sagging my face soaked sweating. Before the show Im in the bathroom resting. My own private seat I peep a magazine. Think about how Im a emcee for his majesty. I want a freak yall take ye so high I want freedom in ye life at all times. We gonna rock from now and forever. Are yall ready? (YEAH) well than bring it.     </segment6>
