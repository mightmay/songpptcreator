		<segment1>I've been up at this all night long. I've been drowning in my sleep. I've prayed for your safe place. And its time for us to leave</segment1>
		<segment2>Time is running on empty and the gas is running out. I've decided that tonight is the night. That I set love aside. Full speed ahead this seems to be the place. I've seen this once before. Planned perfection sought in my dreams. Hoping this would take you home</segment2>
		<segment3>My knuckles have turned to white. There's no turning back tonight. So kiss me one last time</segment3>
		<segment4>Around this turn where the cross will cast your shadow. The people will all gather. To remember such a day where the flames grew as high. As trees. And the world stopped for you and me</segment4>
		<segment5>My knuckles have turned white. There's no turning back tonight. So hold on tight. Kiss me one last time. Shut your eyes</segment5>
		<segment6>I will now bring new meaning to the word alone. Endless nights of dreaming of life. And the days we should have spent here</segment6>
		<segment7>Drowning in my sleep I'm drowning in my sleep</segment7>
		<segment8>Glass shatters and comes to a halt. I thought we'd be there by now. I thought it would be so much quicker than this</segment8>
		<segment9>Pain has never been so brilliant. I made sure you were buckled in. Now you can walk hand in hand with him.     </segment9>
