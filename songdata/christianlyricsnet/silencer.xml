		<segment1>Don't waste your lips on words I've heard before. Kiss my tired head. And each letter written wastes your hand, young man. Come and lead me to your bed. You gave me hope that I'd not lost her. And then thought it rather strange to see me smile-. as I don't do too much smiling these days. </segment1>
		<segment2>She put on happiness like a loose dress. Over pain I'll never know. &quot;So the peace you had,&quot; she says, &quot;I must confess, I'm glad to see it go.&quot;. We're two white roses lying frozen just outside his door. I've made you so happy and so sad, But which should I be more sorry for? </segment2>
		<segment3>Come kiss my face goodbye, that space below my eye and above my cheek. Cause I'm faint and fading fast, I see a darkness. And I shall be released. I'll pass like a fever from this body, And softly slip into his hands. I tried to love you and I failed, But I have another plan. </segment3>
		<segment4>My Lord, how long to sing this song?. And my Lord, how muchmore of this pretending to be strong?. When she stands before your throne. Dressed in beauty not her own. All soft and small, you'll hear her call. &quot;you brought me here, now take me home.&quot;.     </segment4>
