		<segment1>In the circles I've been runnin'. I've covered many miles. And if I could search forever. For what's right before my eyes. Just when I thought I'd found it. It wasn't nothing like I'd planned. And when I got my heart around it. It slipped right through my hands. Here with you I feel it. Close my eyes and see it</segment1>
		<segment2>In a midnight talk. In a morning kiss. When I'm in your arms. That's where it is. When we're tangled up. And can't resist. When we feel that rush. That's where it is....That's where it is</segment2>
		<segment3>When I'm crashing through the madness. Not sure who I'm supposed to be. When I'm caught up in the darkness. It's your hand that's leading me. You bring me back to solid ground. You lift me up right here, right now</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: it's a lifetime filled. With tiny graces. The biggest things. In the smallest places</segment4>
		<segment5>Last chorus: in the sweetest smile. On a night like this. In a tender touch. That's where it is. When we're tangled up. And can't resist. When we fill that rush. That's where it is..That's where it is</segment5>
		<segment6>.     </segment6>
