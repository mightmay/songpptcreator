		<segment1>It's pressure the pleasures measure. The pressure is overbearing. Is it me myself that's caring. For every double-minded joy. And I admit that when I submit to you. I feel so unreal when I'm still. When I'm waiting for you to reveal. And from myself I seem so far away. And I admit that when I submit to you. I can see all of the selfish things I do</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I'm further, further from myself. When I'm next to you. When I run to you</segment2>
		<segment3>I was wasted embraced it but faced it. With you inside my heart you replaced it. Can't believe you have erased it. Selfishness and foolish pride. And I admit that when I submit to you. I can see all of the selfish things I do</segment3>
		<segment4>Further from my future. Further from the past. Further from the starting line. Further from the last. Further from my doubts. Further from my fears. Further from temptation that I faced throughout my years. Further from agitation. Further from distraction. The reaction of the dissatisfaction of others actions. Further from myself. Further from my flesh. Further from my birth and I'm. Further from my death    </segment4>
