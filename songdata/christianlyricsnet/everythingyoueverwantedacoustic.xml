		<segment1>I walk the line. Leave it all behind. I've been waiting forever. Lets go back in time. When I could read your mind. Still I've been waiting </segment1>
		<segment2>It took the seasons going by. To know its not my fault </segment2>
		<segment3>I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest. Tried to be everything that you ever wanted. I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter. Tried to be everything but you </segment3>
		<segment4>Its been so long. Since you've been home. I used to wait up forever. I used to say a prayer. Wishing you were there. And I'm still waiting </segment4>
		<segment5>You told me once. You'd show up. But I fell for that. Before I fell to pieces. Then I woke up. To no one, Just a picture of Jesus. And a house left in pieces </segment5>
		<segment6>. It took the seasons going by. To know its not my fault </segment6>
		<segment7>I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest. Tried to be everything that you ever wanted. I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter. Tried to be everything but you </segment7>
		<segment8>I wanted you. I need you. I want to believe you. I wanted you. I need you. I want to believe you</segment8>
		<segment9>I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest. tried to be everything but you </segment9>
		<segment10>I tried to be perfect, tried to be honest. Tried to be everything that you ever wanted. I tried to be stronger, tried to be smarter. Tried to be everything but you    </segment10>
