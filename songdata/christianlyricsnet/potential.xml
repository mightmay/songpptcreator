		<segment1>Hey there, Mr. Personality, was everybody wrong to think. That you would have the world on it's knees. Or perhaps we were too blind to see that all your grace would fall to entropy. Leaving only fear and apathy and useless dreams</segment1>
		<segment2>And the shadows that you cast so tall on the wall of possibility. Grow closer to infinity with every word that goes unsaid. Cause you could build your house of gold if you could only find a place to start. But for now there's just a question mark hanging on your head</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause you could be the best there ever was (3x). But you won't move cause you're to scared. Potential shines so bright when never dared</segment3>
		<segment4>And I never thought I'd find you gagged and bound by mediocrity. Denying who you want to be how did your standards get so low?. Or are you still content hang your feat in the pool of opportunity. When everyone has yet to see a single thing to show</segment4>
		<segment5>Hey Mr. World at your Feet did you finally accept defeat?. Or was your bark more than your bite. When you wake up from your dream to find your smile has lost it's gleam. Well maybe then you'll see the light</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause you could be the best there ever was (3x). But nothing's gained when nothing's shared. Potential shines so bright when never dared</segment6>
		<segment7>So break those chains and take the world. It's yours to claim, or are you still afraid. To take some value from those impotent dilapidated aspirations    </segment7>
