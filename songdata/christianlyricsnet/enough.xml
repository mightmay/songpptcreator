		<segment1>All of You is more than enough for. All of me for every thirst and every need. You satisfy me with Your love. And all I have in You. Is more than enough</segment1>
		<segment2>You are my supply. My breath of life. Still more awesome than I know. You are my reward. Worth living for. Still more awesome than I know</segment2>
		<segment3>You're my sacrifice of greatest price. Still more awesome than I know. You're my coming King You're everything. Still more awesome than I know    </segment3>
