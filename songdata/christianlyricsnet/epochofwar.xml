		<segment1>The number of men who carried the flame continued to increase. And a massive force was gathered just outside the prison. Where the evil one had trapped the souls of men. And with a sounding trumpet. In an instant the siege was underway. The forces of humanity swarmed the enemy camp. They stormed the gates relentlessly. Waving their torches and shouting together. There is none that can stand against the power of fire.     </segment1>
