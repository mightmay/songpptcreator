		<segment1>John the Baptist prophesied a Messiah will rise. He'll be tried, crucified, ascend in the skies. Years later in the city of Dave. A miracle of God gave a virgin a babe. Kings came from afar, followed a star. To worship baby Jesus who was born in a barn. He brings peace on Earth, His mercy is mild. God and sinners reconciled through the birth of a child. It's the story of my Savior, my reason to sing. Allelujah, let it move ya, Christ is King</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Allelujah. Christ is King. Allelujah. Let the praises ring. Allelujah</segment2>
		<segment3>He stood before Pilot an innocent man. They cried &amp;quot;crucify,&amp;quot; He supplied demand. He was mocked, spit upon, His clothes were torn. Royalty was represented with a crown of thorns. They placed Him in a robe, they gave Him a staff. As they gambled for His garments Roman soldiers laughed. Upon Golgotha they crucified Christ. Sent from above to cold pay your price. On His command opposition was through. But Christ said &amp;quot;Forgive them, they know not what they do&amp;quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>(repeat chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Now Mary ran toward the tomb of her Messiah and Lord. Shocked to find the rock removed that served as a door. She took one step inside, filled with fright. She thought a thief must have stole his body late in the night. As she fell to the ground she began to weep. Heard a voice and turned to hear the Savior speak. Christ the Messiah risen up from the dead. &amp;quot;He's alive, she cried, like the prophecy read. It's the story of my Savior, my reason to sing. Allelujah, Christ is King</segment5>
		<segment6>(repeat chorus)     </segment6>
