		<segment1>I hear your voice calling me, seducing me. To jump into the waters again. My body aches, restraining me, reminding me. Every time I drown in my shame</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm diving headlong. The current's too strong. I knew it was wrong. I'll end up washed up on the shore again</segment2>
		<segment3>Won't somebody, somebody, anybody. Won't somebody rescue me?. Won't somebody, somebody, anybody. Won't somebody rescue me. From the face I try to hide. When I fall undignified?. Won't somebody, somebody, anybody. Won't somebody rescue me?</segment3>
		<segment4>I see the trap, red alert: the threat is there. I have a master and it's not you. Self confident, my will of steel, there'll be no deal. But siren songs distort the truth    </segment4>
