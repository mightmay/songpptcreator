		<segment1>All he needed was PR. A million box of business cards. Careful image consultation. Securing reputation </segment1>
		<segment2>A clever market plan. He didn't understand. That's all it really takes. He could have played for higher stakes </segment2>
		<segment3>Now. Somehow. We've gone wrong</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus:). This Jesus thing, it's a smash hit. It's packaged right. All stocks have split, it's a smash hit, It's gone worldwide</segment4>
		<segment5>Join His name to any cause. Drop His name to get applause. They never get enough. Nothing here to be ashamed of</segment5>
		<segment6>Those ever loyal fans. They wanna get their hands. On His newest merchandising. Ignoring overpricing</segment6>
		<segment7>Now. Oh Wow. We've gone wrong</segment7>
		<segment8>(Repeat Chorus)</segment8>
		<segment9>It has no explanation. It smells like exploitation</segment9>
		<segment10>(Repeat Chorus)    </segment10>
