		<segment1>Headlights crawl by a blur of white. Power lines form proof of life immersed in sleep. The city sits below. Its lights blinking in and out. Of the still trees rain pours. Upon these empty streets. Slowly hitting the ground it falls. Without a sound </segment1>
		<segment2>I cant help this feeling;. I need it, this love inside. You know that I see it;. you feel it, this apathy inside. </segment2>
		<segment3>A constant upon the ocean floor. As footsteps appear they never disappear. Because of you </segment3>
		<segment4>I cant help this feeling;. I need it, this love inside. You know that I see it;. you feel it, this love inside.     </segment4>
