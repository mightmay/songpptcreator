		<segment1>So let's be honest for one moment. Pretend that everything went smooth as planned. &quot;deciever,&quot; &quot;stabbed me in the back,&quot; can't seem to find my words. Where will this lead to?. End in hate?. The feelings of the past and everything attached.</segment1>
		<segment2>Far beyond here. The touch of deception. Always remember the reason you live and there's someone who's watching your back.</segment2>
		<segment3>He taught us to forgive but we forget to let things go. Attached to everything we know. This thrill to leave it all behind. A place where joy was as rare as gold and doubt then stalked my heart. And passion followed close behind, scared stiff of failure alone. Searching for a father's love. But she'll never find it here.</segment3>
		<segment4>Never forget where you came from or what makes you tick. Always remember the reason you live and there's someone who's watching your back.</segment4>
		<segment5>Close your eyes, I will free you    </segment5>
