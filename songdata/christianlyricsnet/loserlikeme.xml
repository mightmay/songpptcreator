		<segment1>you know I need. all the love you give. a loser like me. I just don't know why you would. give it for free. when I don't deserve it. you know now. I wonder why. you wouldn't want to charge. a higher price. you take a loss and still give. another try. knowing that some day. we'll find each other saying </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. your love is fire. and I am the wood. that burns inside. the warmth of your blood. without you I'd fade away. a loser just like me </segment2>
		<segment3>you know I try. to give you all the love I hold inside. I have a hard time when I can't say it right. but I'll see the day when I will find the words and say them </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. your love is fire. and I am the wood. that burns inside. the warmth of your blood. without you and the flame you keep inside. I'd fade into the night. I'll always say them. your love is fire. and I am the wood. that burns inside. the warmth of your blood. without you and the flame you keep inside. I'd fade into the night. a loser just like me </segment4>
		<segment5>you know I need. all the love you give. a loser like me. I just don't know why you would. give it for free     </segment5>
