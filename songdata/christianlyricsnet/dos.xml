		<segment1>Begging - do you mean groveling. Settling - it's not the same. Begging - do we take what's left. Settling - don't take requests. You two, you're what's left, I don't take requests. But for you two, come this far, I might have something, To say (Repeat). Now these two, treat them well. Upon themselves, showed up again. Now you sir, Give up the gig. You haven't been repaid    </segment1>
