		<segment1>They search They lied. This place the face of the fearless. To wait The night. It's gone but you're starting to hear this. It moves So fast. Stopped hearts but holding on faster. Come back Like that. And you know that</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). You will find. That Im everywhere you go. And I'm all the places you will not be. You will find. That I'm everywhere you go. And I'm all the things that you wanna be</segment2>
		<segment3>He leaves This light. This sparkle's broken inside you. I swear It hides. Inside it's moving it's way thru. The ways We hear. The fall of the wind &amp; the whispers. The take So clear. And you know that</segment3>
		<segment4>You will find. That Im everywhere you go. And I'm all the places you will not be. You will find. That I'm everywhere you go. And I'm all the things that you wanna be</segment4>
		<segment5>Constanly moving. Your heart is just wasting away. Endlessly waiting. Your life is just slipping away..</segment5>
		<segment6>You will find. That Im everywhere you go. And I'm all the places you will not be. You will find. That I'm everywhere you go. And I'm all the things that you wanna be. You will find. That I'm everywhere you go. And I'm all the things that you wanna be. You will find. That I'm everywhere you go. And I'm all the things that you wanna be    </segment6>
