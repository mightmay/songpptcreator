		<segment1>It's easy to look at the sun when it's going down. It's easy to look at the sun when it's coming up. Makes my makes my city orange. Makes my makes my heart breathe. In sight of You when I'm next to You. But it's easy to lose mind of You. When the worries form. In You in You my Healer. In You in You I'm sheltered. 'Til the sun again tomorrow. Moments 'til the sun has left. Again tomorrow I'll know Your breath. When the sun goes down. There's an image of You. It's easy to look at the sun when it's going down. It's easy to look at the sun when it's coming up. Led by led by Your light. Led by led by Your love. In the a.m. You are near. In the moon night You are here. With me and I'm assured that. With You with You forever. With You with You I'm with You eternal. 'Til the sun again tomorrow. The sun's going down. There's an image of You. I see the sun's coming up. Rise again tomorrow. Makes my makes my makes my. In You in You in You. Led by led by led by. With You with You with You. I'm with You eternal. 'Til the sun 'til the sun. 'Til the sun again tomorrow. 'Til the sun 'til the sun. There's an image of You    </segment1>
