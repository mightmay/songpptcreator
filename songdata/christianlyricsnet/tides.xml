		<segment1>She's now my new sun. She don't speak but somehow calls me. </segment1>
		<segment2>Automated exchanges make us not lovers, But feigners, we are only strangers. </segment2>
		<segment3>Not estranged to regret, Not estranged to what follows our faulty steps. </segment3>
		<segment4>Ocean tides move to the voice of the moon, Strange how we move. How strange that I move to the voice of the moon, Love ringing out of tune. </segment4>
		<segment5>Regret once kept me from her door, But every time wore off more and more. So now we're back here, Playing sincere with a new set of bones. We are strange. </segment5>
		<segment6>Not estranged to regret. Not estranged to what follows our faulty steps. </segment6>
		<segment7>Ocean tides move to the voice of the moon, Strange how we move. How strange that I move to the voice of the moon, Love ringing out of tune. </segment7>
		<segment8>Leave your bad limbs behind, For they are conduits to the heart.     </segment8>
