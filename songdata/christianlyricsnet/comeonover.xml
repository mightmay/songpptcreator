		<segment1>Chorus: If you're tired of all the pain. And you're hoping that the seasons change. It's time to rearrange. Come on over to the other side. If you're hurting from a broken heart. And you're searching for another start. It's time to realize. Come on over to the other side</segment1>
		<segment2>Now the party's come and gone. Been up all night long. Heard the same old songs. Still you feel alone. Is this how life should be?. Shame and misery. What can set you free. And make you happy?</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>Crying tears of shame. Looking for new hope. Reaching for those friends. That left you long ago. Scoping out the world. For a better life. But if you look to him. He'll give you some insight</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus    </segment5>
