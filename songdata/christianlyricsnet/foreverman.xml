		<segment1>i wanna go higher, higher. set it free. there's gotta be more to touch. than what i see. there's a reason we must be. for the love of God, speak it to me </segment1>
		<segment2>good news for the modern man, yes it is. made by the creator's hands, yes he is. confirmed just who i am. here i stand. the forever man </segment2>
		<segment3>it's gotta be higher, higher. let it be. carry on from this life's brevity. when this mortal coil is twisting. with the love of mercy carry me </segment3>
		<segment4>sometimes we lose our sight. open our eyes. no secret here. heaven is near </segment4>
		<segment5>good news for the modern man, yes it is. eternity in the heart of every man. confirmed just who i am. here i stand. the forever man </segment5>
		<segment6>and the longer i live. the stronger i feel a creator put us here. and the day will come, gravity will run. and we'll meet you in the air. where face to face we will wonder. as the mysteries come undone. and at the end of all our travels. we find our journey's just begun </segment6>
		<segment7>here i stand. it's who i am. here i stand. forever man    </segment7>
