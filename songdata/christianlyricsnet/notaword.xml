		<segment1>Here we are unfaithful with our words. Choices made that separate life and. love leaving empty eyes and. hands that dare not touch the truth. Honestly dishonest this selfish pursuit. buried deep in a discord of faith. While not concerned with their hearts. (here we are unfaithful with our words). discoveries overlooked entirely. What's in my mind what's written on my heart. What's remembered no more</segment1>
		<segment2>The old is obsolete and the new will. make the old soon disappear. Though I feel wicked we can give good things. May my wealth be found and be worthy of my duty. I call for change to end this life I long only to hold true. To be a witness held by goodness held back by conviction. I truly am blowing in the wind. Without you holding me there would be nothing left to speak of. Even though I feel that I am less than the least. can I sing in the shadows of your wings</segment2>
		<segment3>Where else might I sing but in the shadows of your wings?. Where else might I hide but in the shadows of your wings?. Where else?    </segment3>
