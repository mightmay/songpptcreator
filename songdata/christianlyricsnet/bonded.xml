		<segment1>There's a place I like to go, yeah. Far away where nobody knows. And the sun never goes down. I can lose myself in the light I've found. Cause when I am in need. It's your love my heart receives </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I'm bonded with the Son today. And the rays He gave, they light my way child. I'm bonded with the Son today. And I heard Him say &quot;It's all right now&quot; </segment2>
		<segment3>People come, people go, yeah. Some leave you when you need them the most. God is love, He longs to be. More than you can believe. Taste, taste and see. That this love, this love is good </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm bonded with the Son, the Son. I wanna lay everything (down) at Your feet. I wanna see You in my dreams. Speak to me. Take me to a higher place. So I can see </segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
