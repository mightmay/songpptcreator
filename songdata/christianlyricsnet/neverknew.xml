		<segment1>I just ran into a few someones today. Someones that I never really knew. And I used to think how I had them all so figured out</segment1>
		<segment2>But no, none of it's true cuz I never knew you. and now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you. So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you. For my head for my heart for its true</segment2>
		<segment3>So I'm burning the thoughts of the things that I once said. Because you tore down the walls that the world that has put inside my head. And I just get of sick of things that we think, we think we know</segment3>
		<segment4>And no, none of it's true cuz I never knew you. and now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you. So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you. For my head for my heart for its true</segment4>
		<segment5>So take me and save me and change me and then make me. And embrace me and then brave my heart for you. No, No, cuz I can't go on without you. And it's time for something never knowing, oh</segment5>
		<segment6>And no, none of it's true cuz I never knew you. and now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you. So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you. For my head for my heart for its true</segment6>
		<segment7>And as they as strolled along. My heart broke out in song. From all the things and the thoughts and assumptions that I had wrong. See now I'll be on my way to make this claim. I'll make it famous in everyway. I'll make it stay when I will save it..</segment7>
		<segment8>No, none of it's true cuz I never knew you. and now the truth of it is, is I wanna be like you. So hello, good friend, I wanna be next to you. For my head for my heart for its true [x3].     </segment8>
