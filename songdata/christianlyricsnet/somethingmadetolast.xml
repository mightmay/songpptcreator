		<segment1>Everythings so artificial. A fabrication of whats beautiful. I wont be satisfied in my plastic paradise</segment1>
		<segment2>Give me something made to last. Im fading fast. Something to hope in. Cause everything is broken down here. Something made to last. Something made to last</segment2>
		<segment3>Rock and roll - happiness - diamond rings. These are the best of the temporary things. There must be more for us. Cause it's all turning into dust</segment3>
		<segment4>bridge: A kingdoms coming. And it wont stop running. It wont fade away    </segment4>
