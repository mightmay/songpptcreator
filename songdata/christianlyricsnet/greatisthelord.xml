		<segment1>If all I've done. At last should come to nothing. And all I love, like sand be washed away</segment1>
		<segment2>Still I will sing. Of Your unfailing glory. On bended knee. I'll lift my voice and say</segment2>
		<segment3>Great is the Lord. Great is Your name. Till my last breath. I will proclaim</segment3>
		<segment4>Great is the Lord. Great is Your name. I give my life. To sing Your praise</segment4>
		<segment5>If You should speak. Or should remain in silence. Should give me light, or lead me through the dark</segment5>
		<segment6>Whatever the cost. Whatever joy or sorrow. I'll worship still. Because of who You are</segment6>
		<segment7>When death becomes. The end of all my labors. And Christ alone my rest and reward</segment7>
		<segment8>May all I've done. Be one enduring echo. Resounding on to shout. Great is the Lord    </segment8>
