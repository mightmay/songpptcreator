		<segment1>See my hair, it's so long!. How'd I get so strong?. There's a clue in this song. I've got you pinned! Always win! Rip you limb from limb. When old Samson is done!. See me one guy only whippin' your Philistines!. Exercise isn't why!. Shave my head!. I'll be just another man!. Something's wrong 'cause my might headed south tonight . In the arms of Delilah. She was a thorn in my side, she would nag and cry. And I think she's a spy - yeah!. Sleepin' when I woke up, in came the Philistines. Exit might! End of sight! Chained my hands!. Took me to another land!. SPOKEN: Now they made me blind and weak (Now they made me blind and weak). They cavort and hold a feast (They cavort and hold a feast). If I die a foreign slave (If I die a foreign slave). Pray the Lord these poles to shake (Pray the Lord these poles to shake). Watch little pagans! Don't fail me Lord!. They made me blind I'm sure you've heard. Make this a feast they won't forget. Bring their bloodshed on their heads!. Make things right! End their lives! Take a stand!. Take this life! End it right! Take my hands!. Crush them into desert sand! Boom!. Yeah!. Whoa!. Crush them into desert sand! (Shave my head). Crush them into desert sand! (Shave my head)</segment1>
