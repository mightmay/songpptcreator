		<segment1>I searched the world for a song that I could sing. Praise to my King A gift that I could bring. But no music I found could compare to you. Not one could do Justice to your glory. What are my songs compared to yours</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You speak with thunder and lightning. Your voice shakes the mountains. The foundations of the earth. All I can offer is this fragile breath. With each one I'll praise You. With each one I'll praise You more</segment2>
		<segment3>I searched the world for a poem I could read. A rhyme that would bring Glory to my King. But no writing I found was worthy of. This God high above All other gods. What are my words compared to yours</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Speak to me, speak to me please. Won't You speak to me</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
