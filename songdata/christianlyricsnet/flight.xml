		<segment1>Within the chamber of my soul. I find don't know as much as most do, but I know my destiny, and I know. I must choose what path to follow each day. I see the hatred towards my words, toward the one that I love. Must my vaice be silenced?. Must I sit in the shadows of the ones before me?. I see the stone in your hands, I feel the hostility in your eyes, But i won't break down. I receive your anger, I take your frustration, your insults cut at me. Your misconception wear at me, it is hard not to repay the acts sent against me. I won't resign to your control or step back to your bondage. but i'll turn toward my goal, toward the prize that the prize that awaits me. I'll leave this place empty. No revenge left in me, only the comfort of my soul. I have left your affliction behind me.    </segment1>
