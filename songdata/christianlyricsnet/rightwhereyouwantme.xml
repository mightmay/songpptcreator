		<segment1>. Sometimes I feel like. I'm runnin. a race against the world. And I'm loosin. cuz I barely made it pass the starting line. I know I got this crazy idea that your too busy. And I'm helpin you by takin back my life. When it all falls down and blow up in. my face, I realize that it was not my place</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). It's over my head, out of my reach. I lay it down on the ground and it's on my knees. your all that I've got, your all that I need. And suddenly I find myself, Where I need to be. I'm right where you want me</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes I try to pretend that. It's under my control. You remind me, and the truth is I don't. really have a clue. Cuz this life is not about me it's about your mercy. And your glory and every day. becoming more like you. Cuz when it all falls down. And blows up in my face. You lift me up to a higher place</segment3>
		<segment4>(Bridge). You set my feet on solid ground. And when all hope is gone. you are where peace can be found    </segment4>
