		<segment1>Remember me. In a Bible cracked and faded by the years. Remember me. In a santuary filled with silent prayers</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: And age to age. And heart to heart. Bound by grace and peace. Child of wonder, Child of God. I'll remember you. Remember Me</segment2>
		<segment3>Remember me. When the color of the sunset fills the sky. Remember me. When you pray and the tears of joy. fall from your eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Remember me. When the children leave. their Sunday school with smiles. Remember me. When they're old enough to teach. Old enough to preach. Old enough to leave</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Age to age and heart to heart. Child of wonder child of God</segment7>
		<segment8>Remember me</segment8>
		<segment9>Age to age and heart to heart. Child of wonder child of God    </segment9>
