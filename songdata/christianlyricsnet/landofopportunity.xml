		<segment1>Another day's off and running. And I hear somebody pounding on my door. It's opportunity knocking. Says what I need is just a little bit more. Every time I turn around I'm finding. Another chance to climb a little higher up. But it's never what I thought once I get there. And I'm left wondering How much is enough?</segment1>
		<segment2>I can live like a prisoner to all that could be. I'm living in the land of opportunity. But a heart pure and simple. Is a heart that stays free. Living in the land of opportunity. I'm living in the land of opportunity</segment2>
		<segment3>This is a world full of options. It's like a never ending buffet line. While all that I'm really needing. I living water and the bread of life. So as I'm walking through this life making choices. There is one thing I must never forget. This land of opportunity has one God. If I seek Him first He'll take care of the rest. (Chorus). Seek ye first the kingdom of God. Seek ye first the kingdom of God</segment3>
		<segment4>Seek ye first the kingdom of God. So many choices, so much it could be. Seek ye first the kingdom of God. Living in the land of opportunity     </segment4>
