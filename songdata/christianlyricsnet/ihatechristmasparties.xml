		<segment1>[Performed by Matthew Thiessen &amp; the Earthquakes]</segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse]. I hope it snows this week, A snow flake on your cheek. Would make this Christmas so Beautiful. But that would just bring the pain. Cause things can't stay the same. These Holidays won't be wonderful</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. I look under the tree. But there's nothing to see. Cause it's a broken heart that you're giving me</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't figure it out. Is this what Christmas is all about. Cause it's a broken heart that you're giving me</segment4>
		<segment5>[Verse 2]. I don't wanna talk. I'm sick of all this talking. A broken heart wrapped up in a Box. This tear drops in my stocking</segment5>
		<segment6>[Bridge]. I hate Christmas parties, They offer me some punch, But I just shrug. I hate Christmas parties. You and the cookie. Tray hear me say bahumba</segment6>
		<segment7>Ful la la la la lala la la la la la [x3]</segment7>
