		<segment1>We live in a world of hate. A beautiful place seen through obscure eyes. Caught in the glimpse of this life. How do I find what I seek? Where does Your glory and I meet? This speck of light is my creeping death. I cant wait till Im dead only to live again. Filled with filth. I dont need this anymore. Filled with filth. I dont need this anymore. How can I think that I am alive. When I have never lived before? This speck of light is my creeping death. I cant wait till Im dead only to live again. This world has created an ending that starts tonight. We live in a world of hate. A beautiful place seen through obscure eyes. Caught in the glimpse of this life. How do I find what I seek? Where does Your glory and I meet? This is where I begin! This is where I begin! This is where I begin! This is where I begin!    </segment1>
