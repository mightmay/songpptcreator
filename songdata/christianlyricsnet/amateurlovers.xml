		<segment1>Everyone I know. Needs love like drugs. Like a common cold. We could never shrug</segment1>
		<segment2>My baby and me. We're missing the same stuff. We've all got a disease. Deficiency of love</segment2>
		<segment3>Every day we still try. Every night we still cry. Driving home on the 805</segment3>
		<segment4>We don't know what we're doing. We do it again. We're just amateur lovers. With amateur friends</segment4>
		<segment5>I can tell you what you're thinking now. Before you think that you can settle down</segment5>
		<segment6>We don't know what we're doing. Let's do it again</segment6>
		<segment7>You tried to play it down. But it never stuck. I tried to build this town. I'm getting no such luck. When nobody's around. I keep my eyes on the clock. There ain't a cure I've found. In all my times around this block</segment7>
		<segment8>Everyday we still try. Every night we still cry. Driving home on the 405</segment8>
		<segment9>We don't know what we're doing. We do it again. We're just amateur lovers. With amateur friends</segment9>
		<segment10>I can tell you what you're thinking now. Before you think that you can settle down. We don't know what we're doing. Let's do it again</segment10>
		<segment11>We don't know what we're doing. Let's do it again. We're just amateur lovers. With amateur friends</segment11>
		<segment12>I can tell you what you're thinking now. Before you think that you can settle down. Our lovin' isn't gonna burn us out</segment12>
		<segment13>We don't know what we're doing. Let's do it again</segment13>
		<segment14>Professional    </segment14>
