		<segment1>No one is righteous. They all fall so short. Only through their faith will they not be condemned. Their throats as open graves. Tongues that practice deceit. The poison of vipers is on their lips. And the hearts of his children are turning to the dark. They're mutilating his very word. There is none righteous. Not even one. No fear of God before their eyes     </segment1>
