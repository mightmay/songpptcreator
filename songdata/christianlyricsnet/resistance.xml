		<segment1>You wanna watch us break?. Be the first to take us down. But you're (??) alone. And theres no stopping us now. You called me mental. Your speeches are maligned. Take down this modern town. Four words penned with you in mind </segment1>
		<segment2>Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. You crash where you stand. You've got a riot on your hands. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. Too late to make demands. When you've got a riot on your hands </segment2>
		<segment3>Silent alarms are ringing. Sounds of revolt draw near. A new united front. That you will come to fear. We will hold together. To become the change. Those are the voices. With every common man engaged </segment3>
		<segment4>Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. You crash where you stand. You've got a riot on your hands. Speak. Speak for yourself. You paper tigers. Too late to make demands. When youve got a riot </segment4>
		<segment5>Ignite and watch us burn. Til every embers turn. My God we'll feel inspired. When we set your walls to fire.     </segment5>
