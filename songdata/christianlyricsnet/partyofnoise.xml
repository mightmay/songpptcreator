		<segment1>Noise makers signal the party that. silence has won. One love, one way, you're singing a song of pain </segment1>
		<segment2>When God whispers your name. You say goodbye or welcome home </segment2>
		<segment3>As far as I can see. I'm missing, I'm missing the words you say </segment3>
		<segment4>Die trying! You're leaving in vain, you're quiet again. I'm lost in my sins, I need to escape..Save me! </segment4>
		<segment5>Can you save me?. Now what good is a faith. when you live in silence?. And your works reveal hate, can you still claim you're safe?.     </segment5>
