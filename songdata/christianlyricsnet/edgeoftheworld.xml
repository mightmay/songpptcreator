		<segment1>I know your face. I know your smile and how it plays. Into the minds of those who. Cling to every word you say</segment1>
		<segment2>This isn't how I wanted to. Remember me and you. Your eyes are talking but. Your lips are standing still.. Open your mouth tell me. How I'm supposed to feel?</segment2>
		<segment3>My finger pointings just a warning. So I suggest you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Say you're wrong. Let's get this over I. Would like to get some sleep tonight. Let's get this over, I'd like to get some sleep tonight</segment4>
		<segment5>You make it hard for me to leave. So very hard for me to leave. By now the lies you told are weighing on your chest. If I provide the rope I know you'll do the rest.</segment5>
		<segment6>But I will not be an accessory. No I'm not who you think. And I will never be your enemy. So don't insult me</segment6>
		<segment7>Say you're wrong. This could be easier. If I was over her. Say you're wrong. I know she's just a girl. But shes got me standing on the edge. I'm on the edge of the world</segment7>
		<segment8>(My eyes are open for the first time). (This place not yours it's in my own eyes)</segment8>
		<segment9>I am not a man who lives a life of soldiers. I am not the kind of man who walks away. I will stand up face to face or toe to toe with anyone. Yes anyone.. Everything you said about me was the truth but. I just don't think that I can look at you the same. You're like a splinter that will never show its head to anyone. To anyone.. Now I know that I was not the man you wanted. You know I loved you and I wanted to make you proud. My intentions were to never give myself to anyone. Look what I've done</segment9>
		<segment10>(Just look at what I've done). My intentions were to never give myself to anyone. Look what I've done.     </segment10>
