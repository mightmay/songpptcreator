		<segment1>And all these dreams I've made. I take them all and lay them down. In light of reasons I have found now. And I can rest in knowing you will open every door. Instead of forcing my own world now. I'd rather wait on you</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You'll be the one to call me out. I have found that it's the only way. You'll be the one to call me out. I have found that it's the only way</segment2>
		<segment3>I know that I have plans but you will take me every step. You have covered all my debt now. And I have realized these empty fames that people crave. Are based on hopes of what they've made now. I'd rather wait on you</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Well there's more than what I'm feeling. Well there's more than what I'm feeling</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
