		<segment1>[Verse]. If music is. A mirror revealing. The depths of my heart. Then I will write. The darkest song. For without. Forgiveness. My soul is lost</segment1>

		<segment6>[Break]</segment6>
		<segment7>For I have fallen. And there is nothing good. Within me yet I've. Been given life. I will. I will never. Deserve. For without. Forgiveness. Without forgiveness my soul is lost</segment7>
