		<segment1>all my dreams. I had dreamed were dreams of me. all my hopes. were desires of what I wanted to be. with ambitions put aside. I crawl in your arms to hide. I have given up to you </segment1>
		<segment2>this is all (this is all). this is everything. this is all (this is all). this is everything. this is everything I've got </segment2>
		<segment3>the good things. and the bad things are in your hands. my hopes and my dreams. are in your command. and I come before you now. as imperfect as I am. and I give. yes, I give it all to you     </segment3>
