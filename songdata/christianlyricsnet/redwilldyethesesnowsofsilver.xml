		<segment1>I arrived to hear the earth unleash its cries. A guilty hand. The fruit of past fracturings. First to be of many future histories. From suffered birth</segment1>
		<segment2>Now red will dye these snows of silver. Red will dye these snows of silver</segment2>
		<segment3>Famous by the mark inflicted on your life. The generations find new use for your crime. On green hills an angel guards a bleak reminder. For all time     </segment3>
