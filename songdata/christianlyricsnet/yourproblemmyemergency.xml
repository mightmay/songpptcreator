		<segment1>Get a clue, I'm not here for you. And I'm not like you </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm not gonna do what you say is right. 'Cause then I'll end up just like you. I'm gonna rebel, I'm gonna fight. This organized manipulation </segment2>
		<segment3>Learn to think before you speak. And you just might make a point </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm just an average guy, is that hard to accept?. I live a normal life I've got no regrets. Don't make me out to be something that I'm not. I never said I was anything, so don't expect me to be </segment4>
		<segment5>Why is your problem always my emergency?. This is no court of law, you're all speculation. Sex masquerades as rock and roll. And manufactured music to save your soul. So go and do your homework. Demographics target marketing    </segment5>
