		<segment1>You see all things.        . Into the corners of each heart.  . Everything is in Your hands.                  . From the cradle to the stars </segment1>
		<segment2>You take our dreams.       . And all we hope to be.                . Through joy and tears, pain and laughter.        . We know you'll never leave.          . Oh, You are a love divine.                      . There's nothing better in this world.                   . That we could ever find </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, Your truth gives life.           . You came to set the captives free.                               . And You've opened up our eyes </segment3>
		<segment4>We were lost, now we're found.                                  . Changed inside and out.                            . When Your love came dow    </segment4>
