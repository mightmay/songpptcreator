		<segment1>Stop. Take a minute take a breath, From the pressure that we need to know why, What makes you ali-i-i-ive</segment1>
		<segment2>Why, Rely on ourselves. Putting God up on a shelf we depend, On what's left in our heads</segment2>
		<segment3>It feels right and we believe, There won't be no sudden leave. But we keep running faster</segment3>
		<segment4>Isn't it so nice to think, If we live in harmony. There'd be a happy ever after</segment4>
		<segment5>(CHORUS). It doesn't matter if I. Had faith to move a mountain, Drink the Ocean Dry. Baby,I could never save myself. It Doesn't matter if I. Could reach into the deepest Corners of my mind. Baby, I could never save myself</segment5>
		<segment6>Stop, Putting God in a box, Spend our time watching the clock While we wait. For a release that will take us away</segment6>
		<segment7>Come down with a crash. Until we have another chance to go back. Is that gonna make it OK?</segment7>
		<segment8>Hold your breath and you will see. In the end you'll have to breath, But we keep running faster</segment8>
		<segment9>Fast. We forget reality. If you fall you're gonna bleed</segment9>
		<segment10>There is no happy ever after</segment10>
		<segment11>(CHORUS)</segment11>
		<segment12>(BRIDGE). Falling out under sorrow. Glimpses of the past of what I used to think. and who I used to be. I'm realizing all that's real that I have in me</segment12>
		<segment13>it doesn't matter. you better fight the laws of gravity. it doesn't matter. if i start it over</segment13>
		<segment14>(Chorus). (Chorus)</segment14>
		<segment15>save myself. save myself. save myself. save myself    </segment15>
