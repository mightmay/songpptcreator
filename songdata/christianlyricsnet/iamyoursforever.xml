		<segment1>What I want is to be known by you, Lord. To be famous in your eyes. I don't care if the world knows my name. For it's you I long to please</segment1>
		<segment2>To please you. To honor you. This one thing I desire</segment2>
		<segment3>Show the wonder of your love. Give me all that I can take. Show your power in my heart. Make me the apple of your eye. Show me you</segment3>
		<segment4>What I want is to be rich in your love. To be jaded with your ways. I could gain all the wealth in the world. But it can't compare to you</segment4>
		<segment5>There's nothing. There's no one. To take the place of you.     </segment5>
