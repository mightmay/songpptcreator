		<segment1>Take a closer look what do you see?. Do you see the man I want to be?. Shouldn't it be obvious?. Shouldn't you be curious?</segment1>
		<segment2>Listen closely things aren't as they seem. Voices bright once slowly lose their gleam. Is this all I'll ever be?. A fading glimpse of tragedy?</segment2>
		<segment3>Take my life and let it be. Given wholly Lord to thee. Take my lips in ceaseless praise. And I will give it all to thee</segment3>
		<segment4>Touch my face and tell me what you feel. Digging deeper shows you what is real. Isn't there a man inside. Who's slowly being sanctified</segment4>
		<segment5>All to Jesus I surrender. All to him I freely give. I will ever love and trust him. In his presence daily live</segment5>
		<segment6>Jesus, Jesus how I trust him. How I've proved him o'er and o'er. Jesus, Jesus precious Jesus. Oh for grace to trust him more</segment6>
		<segment7>Take my life and let it be. Given wholly Lord to thee. Take my lips in ceaseless praise. And I will give it all to Thee. I will give it all to Thee.     </segment7>
