		<segment1>. I have been so worn and so spent. Medicate whats left and leave the rest. Fight to love and live I must confess. Medicate whats left forget the rest. Stranger things have touched and graced the ancient eyes. And it comes as no, comes as no surprise</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]: And I found it hard to believe. But I know that You will. Yeah I know Your will. Because the sun stands still. The sun stands still</segment2>
		<segment3>Bathe in beams of love and jealousy. To breathe the light of heaves kiss. A million beams will wait just for me, just for me. You hold the day with bloodstained wrists</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh Jesus, Youre the one who puts the hallelujahs on my lips. Youre the holder of the sun, sweet salvation yes yes. Jesus youre the one</segment5>
		<segment6>So when I stand on Gibeon. And when the night has come. Im not alone, I see the light. Of the one, of the one I love</segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS]</segment7>
		<segment8>Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Jesus youre the one. The holder of the sun      </segment8>
