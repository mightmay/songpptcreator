		<segment1>Verse 1: All alone in a lonely apartment. I remember the moment my. Heart went crazy..crazy. You were all that a young. Boy dreams of. When he's hopin' and prayin'. For true love, baby. </segment1>
		<segment2>I never believed that dreams. Came true, But I've become a believer, Because of you. </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I would do anything for you, I would change the world. If you asked me to, Just to hold the sun and. The moon for you, That is my desire, That is my desire. </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: Standing at the road before us. Ain't nothing gonna come between us, Baby. All the years, even though. There were tears, Through it all we have always. Stayed together, baby. I'm certain that miracles come true. </segment4>
		<segment5>Just as sure that there's an angel, Watchin' over me and you </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus 2: I would do anything for you, I would change the world. If you asked me to, (oh if I could). Just to hold the sun. And the moon for you, That is my desire. (I'd walk through fire). I'd walk through fire, Through the pouring rain, Just to fall deep inside. Your arms again. (to be your love). To be your lover, Just to be your friend, That is my desire. </segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge: Some things are forever, Like the glimmer of love. In your eyes. I can't help but wonder how, This love can be stronger. Than it feels to me right now. </segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus:..     </segment8>
