		<segment1>I saw the Lord, seated on a throne, high and exalted. And the train of His robe filled the temple. Above Him were angels, with six mighty wings. With two they'd cover their faces. With two they'd cover thier feet. And with two, they'd fly. With two, they'd fly..and sing</segment1>
		<segment2>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty. And the whole earth is full of His glory. He's glorious</segment2>
		<segment3>I said, &quot;Woe to me, I am ruined. For I am unclean, and so are all my kind. But my eyes have seen the King. The Lord Almighty, Lord Almighty&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>An angel flew to me and he had fire in His hand. He put it to my lips and God took away my sin. He took away my sin</segment4>
		<segment5>So we sing..    </segment5>
