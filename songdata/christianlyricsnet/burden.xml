		<segment1>People say God is dead. But how can they think that. If I show them the devil</segment1>
		<segment2>You will suffer greatly. but through you many will come to see. that the realm of the spirit is real</segment2>
		<segment3>I feel this pain, I feel it burn in my heart. I know that this is a test. To make me stronger. You tell me this is my cross. That I bear for the weak. I'll give you all that I am, You're my blood. You're my strength. Now learn, and live through this. and let it burn</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't let this burden flee from me. till the lesson is complete. Because the pain is teaching me. Who I need to be</segment4>
		<segment5>The clarity is getting stronger. My heart is teaching me. what my eyes can't see. You wrote your name on my heart. I am the sparrow. I bear this pain in your name. It makes me stronger. Now learn and live through this. And let it burn</segment5>
		<segment6>Don't let this burden flee from me. till the lesson is complete. Because the pain is teaching me. Who I need to be</segment6>
		<segment7>Why did the demons not leave me tonight. You can come with me in peace free of your bodily form or you can choose to continue this. the choice is yours. I choose to stay</segment7>
		<segment8>Don't let this burden flee from me. till the lesson is complete. Because the pain is teaching me. Who I need to be. About the man I want to be. For all the ones who count on me. Because the pain is teaching me. Who I need to be    </segment8>
