		<segment1>Looking into your eyes I see all I want to be. And I don't want it to end. If I could only put into words the way I see you. I only know I have an angel with me now</segment1>
		<segment2>And when I fall asleep your all that I see. You're in my thoughts and all of my prayers. I wish I could mean all that you mean to me. My angel without wings (My angel)</segment2>
		<segment3>I wish you could see all that you mean to me. But I could never find the words to tell you</segment3>
		<segment4>That when I fall asleep you're all that I see. You're in my thoughts and all of my prayers. I wish I could mean all that you mean to me. And when I fall asleep your all that I see. You're in my thoughts and all of my prayers. I wish I could mean all that you mean to me. My angel without wings.     </segment4>
