		<segment1>Enough of the fighting. Day after day. Ive hit the wall. Trying to live my way. Ive been running. Im wearing thin. This is where I stop. And where you begin</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I surrender. I lie down. I give up. Enough of the bleeding. My chest hurts</segment2>
		<segment3>From all this digging. Under my dirt. Im in a struggle. Tearing me apart. Is this just madness?. Or the changing of my heart?</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: Into your arms I crumble. Into your arms I crawl. Into your arms I stumble. Letting go you catch my fall    </segment5>
