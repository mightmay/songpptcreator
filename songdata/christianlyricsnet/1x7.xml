		<segment1>One times seven equals heaven. Traditions the creation of men. Religion for the sake of religion. Rituals the right of profession. Clergies of ranks, the files and lines brainwash the sect for the mentally blind. And now Babylon's got a new name. for those modern disguises to hide the shame. It's a choice between God and man. Undermined by the heretics hand. Humanity's last ditch try to build a bridge to heaven with earthly lives. Brace yourself. The saints die today. Blinder leading the blinded. Indulgence buys the sick minded. Fallibility secures the fallacy. Reinterpret the facts of history. Doctrines a pile of yokes. Salvation or collars to choke off the life with infinite ropes to climb. Brainwashed to think your face is worth the time. Arrogance rich with Sundays that pack the walls with some idols to spare. Exalt and isolate acts to reject the faith that's born form the facts. Never mind the saints that died. Your foundation has been undermined    </segment1>
