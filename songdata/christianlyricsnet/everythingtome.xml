		<segment1>When i feel down i look to you. When i feel low your words ring true. Its not by might or in my strength. But its by your spirit moving in my life. Cos God you are my life</segment1>
		<segment2>I will praise you. you're everything to me. I'll live for you. You're the reason that i sing. I won't go back to the way it used to be. Cos i've found you and your everything to me</segment2>
		<segment3>At times when i look down and all i see is. Sinking sand. I'm thankful that it's you the solid rock on. Which i stand    </segment3>
