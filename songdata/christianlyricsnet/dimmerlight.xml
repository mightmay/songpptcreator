		<segment1>There's a dimmer light in this room tonight. And you'll be the last one to know when it's off. So with this dimmer light in my room tonight, I wonder if we're gonna make it at all. </segment1>
		<segment2>And there's a brighter sky to this dreadful night. And you and me are the first to watch it fade. So with this brighter sky from my room tonight, I feel, down here, a little more betrayed. </segment2>
		<segment3>How do I get back to where I was, when you were smiling. You were smiling. </segment3>
		<segment4>You were smiling baby. </segment4>
		<segment5>Now there's a tempt to die under this heartless sky. We'll bid farewell without an ear to hear me, A tempt to die, and not put up a fight. Cause no one ever wanted to end this early. </segment5>
		<segment6>How do I get back to where I was, when you were smiling. You were smiling. </segment6>
		<segment7>You were smiling baby. </segment7>
		<segment8>So there's that bright light, the one that leaded me here. The one that's screaming to be noticed. The one responsible for all of this. So I'll take this other road, after I get up from my knees. Because I'm sick of being lied to. And I'm afraid of where the other one leads. </segment8>
		<segment9>You were smiling baby.     </segment9>
