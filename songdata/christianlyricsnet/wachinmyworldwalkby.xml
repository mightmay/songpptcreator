		<segment1>Everyday at the same time. On the corner of third and main. I take my place against the pawn shop window. Waiting for the scene to change</segment1>
		<segment2>The first time I saw her. Everything started to spin. So back on up boy and hope don't tight. 'cause here she comes again</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Watchin' my world walkin' by. What I wouldn't give to have her by my side. Watchin' my world, my world walking by</segment3>
		<segment4>She's got her eyes like a Sunday in Paris. Legs like midnight in Rome. Smile as warm as the California sun. Settin' on the seaside town</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Hey, hey, hey women, please dance. I'm going to step out and stand in her way. And hope that maybe she'll notice me. But tellin' that I'm going to watch, and wait, and see. If she comes again</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>And down this street. I believe one day she'll be walkin' next to me side. They'll be watchin' me in my world, walk by. hey hey hey hey    </segment8>
