		<segment1>I'm lost and broken, all alone on this road. the wheels keep turnin', but the feelin' is gone. when I fear I'm on my own. You remind me I am not alone. when You said</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I'd leave ninety-nine. leave them all behind. to find you. for you alone. I'd leave ninety-nine. leave them all behind. to find you</segment2>
		<segment3>it's dark and lonely and the path is unclear. can't move my feet because I'm frozen in fear. then you say, &quot;My child, my child -. I am always here, I'm by your side&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>you're never too far down. I promise you'll be found. I'll reach into the mud and mirely clay. pursue you to the end. like a faithful friend. nothing in this world can keep me away</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)    </segment6>
