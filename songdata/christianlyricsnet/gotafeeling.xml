		<segment1>You know she's one in a million. One of the few that night. I'm going to ask her the question. Can anyone tow this line</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. She's on the first line, keeping everybody in tow. She's on the first line, keeping everybody in tow</segment2>
		<segment3>She's only moving lightly, Keeping her back up straight. You know she's breaking the rules, But someone knows how to play this game.</segment3>
		<segment4>She's on the first line, keeping everybody in tow. She's on the first line, keeping everybody in tow. I've got a feeling she could be alone all night. I've got a feeling she could be alone all night.</segment4>
		<segment5>Like a bull at a gate, Jumped the gun like I've always done. Tripped head over heels. Cold feelings surround me</segment5>
		<segment6>I've got a feeling she could be alone all night. I've got a feeling she could be alone all night.    </segment6>
