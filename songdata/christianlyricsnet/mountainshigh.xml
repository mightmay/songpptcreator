		<segment1>Sorrow came to visit us today. Was the longest day, was the loneliest day. Sorrow came to steal our hope away. Only tears can tell. Of this holy hour</segment1>
		<segment2>This mountain's high, too high for us. This mountain's high, too high for us</segment2>
		<segment3>Sorrow came quicker than a fire. Was the longest day, was the loneliest day. I feel your hand, the warmth, your sweetest smile. But you slipped away, through the great divide</segment3>
		<segment4>This mountain's high, too high for us. This mountain's high, too high for us</segment4>
		<segment5>Your ways are high, too high for us. Your ways are high, too high for us    </segment5>
