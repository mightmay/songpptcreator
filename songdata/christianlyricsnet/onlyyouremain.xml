		<segment1>[Verse 1:]. Only One never having a beginning. Only One who reigns when everything is ending. High above. Glorious and true</segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-Chorus:]. We sing, Holy, the only uncreated One. Holy, the Light that was before the sun. You shine. And even when the stars have left the sky</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. You remain. Even when the earth is shaken. You remain. Even when our kings have fallen. Every mountain standing tall will crash into the sea. You were, You are, You will be. Only You remain</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 2:]. Only One who stood before the universe. Only One authored life with just a word. Lord of all. There is none like You</segment4>
		<segment5>[Bridge:]. Eternal. Immortal. Forever the same. (You remain)     </segment5>
