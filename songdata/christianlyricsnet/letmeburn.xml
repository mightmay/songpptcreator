		<segment1>You are the stream that flows in the desert. Reviving my heart and flooding my soul. You are the flame that splits through the darkness. To burn up my sin and point where to go</segment1>

		<segment3>Let the nations rejoice in you. Let your people return to you. Let the source of my life be you. Let me burn for you. Let your fire of justice reign. Let creation confess your name. Turn my heart from stone to clay. Let me burn with praise</segment3>

		<segment6>Let the nations rejoice in you. Let your people return to you. Let the source of my life be you. Let me burn for you. Let your fire of justice reign. Let creation confess your name. Turn my heart from stone to clay. Let me burn, let me burn with praise. Oh, with praise, yeah</segment6>
