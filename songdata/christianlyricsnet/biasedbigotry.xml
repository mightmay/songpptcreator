		<segment1>It's so easy to find the faults. In everyone else &amp; not look at myself. I'm geting used to not having to. Look at the facts of where I'm at </segment1>
		<segment2>You don't know me so don't judge me. Your biased bigotry can't control me </segment2>
		<segment3>God's son my judge only He &amp; not you who ar you. You see my skin God see's my heart deep within </segment3>
		<segment4>The way I see the way it seems to me. I won't agree you can't live my life for me    </segment4>
