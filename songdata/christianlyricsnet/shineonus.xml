		<segment1>This city doesnt sleep at night. At ten oclock it comes alive. Theres 20 million people, then theres me. A taxi driver every day. A lot of work, a little pay. Just looking for a way to find some peace</segment1>
		<segment2>But finding peace. Is way too hard. When youre looking in the dark</segment2>
		<segment3>So shine, shine, shine on us. Oh God, we need Your love. These streets arent bright enough. Oh Jesus, shine on us</segment3>
		<segment4>Im sitting on this corner here. My dignity just disappears. With every coin I beg into this cup. No matter how much people pay. It doesnt matter anyway. It never ever seems to be enough</segment4>
		<segment5>The light inside. My heavy heart. Is getting way too dark</segment5>
		<segment6>So shine, shine, shine on us. Oh God, we need Your love. These streets arent bright enough. Oh Jesus, shine on us</segment6>
		<segment7>God above is full of mercy. Turning darkness into dawn. All you who are weak and weary. Lift your heads and sing this song</segment7>
		<segment8>Shine, shine, shine on us. Oh God, we need Your love. These streets arent bright enough. Oh Jesus, shine on us</segment8>
		<segment9>Shine, shine, shine on us. Oh God, we need Your love. These streets arent bright enough. Oh Jesus, shine on us    </segment9>
