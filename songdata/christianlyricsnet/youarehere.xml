		<segment1>. Only by your love I am breathless. Only by your touch I am left forever. Longing for your presence and somehow. Abandoned to the mystery I've found</segment1>
		<segment2>How your majesty once again can. Strike a chord in me. Leaving me surrendered. Knowing I am heaven's. And always worshipping. The love of my life</segment2>
		<segment3>You are here you are here with me. Everywhere I go you are loving me. I am yours and you are mine. Forevermore</segment3>
		<segment4>Through the valleys low. You will keep me. O where can I go. Holiness surrounds me. Angels all around me forever. Shadowed your glory I hide</segment4>
		<segment5>Hallelujah, hallelujah</segment5>
		<segment6>Shadowed your glory forever I hide. You are here you are here with me. Everywhere I go you are loving me. Hallelujah, hallelujah.     </segment6>
