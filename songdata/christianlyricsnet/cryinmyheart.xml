		<segment1>There's a cry in my heart. For Your glory to fall. For Your presence to fill up my senses. There's a yearning again. A thirst for discipline. A hunger for things that are deeper </segment1>
		<segment2>Could You take me beyond?. Could You carry me through?. If I open my heart?. Could I go there with You?. (For I've been here before. But I know there's still more. Oh, Lord, I need to know You) </segment2>
		<segment3>For what do I have. If I don't have You, Jesus?. What in this life. Could mean any more?. You are my rock. You are my glory. You are the lifter. Of my head. Lifter of this head    </segment3>
