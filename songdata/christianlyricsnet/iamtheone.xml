		<segment1>You lost your courage, you gave it away. Trading you virtue for the lies that bring shame. Feel so alone now, secrets keep you from me. Trying to hide it all but know that I see, it. Because I was there when those thoughts began. I was there when you changed within. I was there as guilty tears you cried. I'm still here, please understand that I</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. I am the one who restores your soul. I am the one who makes you whole again. No matter what you've done, how far you've run. Just turn around cause I'm waiting to hold you</segment2>
		<segment3>Dont be misled now, don't remain in that space. Secrets they hate the light so come into my place. Its a paceful thing to confess. That you lost your pureness. But know its not hopeless cause I</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Realize that what you've done has distanced you from me. Determine in your heart, you'll do whatever to be free. Turn from your past and leave the old ways behind. Walk with me so closely, never doubt that you are mine. And if they try to judge you, and would turn you away. Know that I have saved you, theres no need to be ashamed. You turned from your past and left your old ways behind. Your walking with me so you tell the world that you are mine. The one.</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS (2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>Realize that what you've done has distanced you from me. (You made a separation). Determine in your heart, you'll do whatever to be free. (I'm here to offer you salvation). Turn from your past and leave the old ways behind. (Let me be your destination). Walk with me so closely, never doubt that you are mine. (Nobody can separate you from my love).     </segment7>
