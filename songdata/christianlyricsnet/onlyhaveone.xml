		<segment1>Nobody knows which way you'll go. I can't control you. I pray tomorrow is brighter than today </segment1>
		<segment2>I should not try to live two lives. I only have one. I only have one. You have yours and I have mine. We only have one life </segment2>
		<segment3>I watch you make the same mistake. You learn the hard way. I pray tomorrow you will hear. What love has to say </segment3>
		<segment4>I should not try to live two lives. I only have one. I only have one. You have yours and I have mine. [ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/j/jj-heller-lyrics/only-have-one-lyrics.html ]. We only have one life </segment4>
		<segment5>I try to hold you with an open hand. You run away. And you're faster than I am. I can lead you to the water. But I cannot make you drink. Is it too much to ask for you. To simply stop and think </segment5>
		<segment6>Still I should not try to live two lives. I only have one. I only have one. You have yours and I have mine. We only have one life. And we only have one life. Yeah we only have one life    </segment6>
