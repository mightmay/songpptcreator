		<segment1>I'm searching for a king and kingdom. Here among the beggars and the weak. The broken and redeemed. I'm finding grace beyond all measure. In flesh and blood He hides His majesty. inside of you and me. Why would a king do such a thing?. ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL. ISN'T IT MARVELOUS?. THE GOD OF THE UNIVERSE. HE BECAME ONE OF US. WE CRY OUT AND THEN. LOVE COMES DOWN AGAIN. FAITH (HOPE) (LOVE) IS FOUND IN HIM, HALLELUJAH. Glorious beyond all measure. Bending low to wash His traitor's feet. People just like me. Why would a king do such a thing?. Sing, sing for faith. Sing for hope. Sing for what great love has done. What was lost He has found. Shout it out    </segment1>
