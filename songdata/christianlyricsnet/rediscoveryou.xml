		<segment1>I need to just admit. My faith is paper thin. I'm feeling so burned out on religion</segment1>
		<segment2>I say an empty prayer. I sing a tired song. I need to just admit. that the passions gone. And I want to get it back</segment2>
		<segment3>You told me. Look for you, and I will find. So I'm here. Like I'm searching for the first time. Revive me, Jesus. Make this cold heart start to move. Help me rediscover You</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to learn to pray. The way that David prayed. I want my soul to burn. when I hear Your name</segment4>
		<segment5>I want to feel like new. I want to hunger for You. Bring me back to life like only You can do. Cause I don't want to stay the same</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord, I want to be Yours today. I want to know the passion of the saints. And how they were changed</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to burn for You. Bring me back to life. Jesus, help me rediscover You    </segment7>
