		<segment1>Wasted time. I can not say that I was ready for this. But when worlds collide, And all that I have is all that I want. The words seem to flow. And the thoughts they keep running. And all that I have is yours. All that I am is yours.</segment1>
		<segment2>Painted skies. I've seen so many that cannot compare. To your ocean eyes. The pictures you took. That cover your room, And it was just like the sun. But more like the moon. A light that cant reach at all. So now I'm branded for taking the fall.</segment2>
		<segment3>So when you say forever, Can't you see you've already captured me. </segment3>
