		<segment1>Live for today. We'll dream tomorrow. We've got big plans in sight. We'll take this city and by nightfall.. The bright lights are calling</segment1>
		<segment2>Everything is going our way. Everything is just as we've planned. This is our future (from what we've heard). And i've still got your hand</segment2>
		<segment3>And it feels like we could last forever. And im not doing to do this alone</segment3>
		<segment4>When memories fade. We've got each other. When time and confusion collide. Singin' I hold it all when I hold you. When friends walk other ways. We've got each other. I hold it all when I hold. I hold it all when I hold you</segment4>
		<segment5>We fell on hard times. This isn't the ideal. Miles from home. Doing the best we can (Best that we can)</segment5>
		<segment6>I won't do this without you. I won't do this without you so take heart. 'Cause you know that you have mine</segment6>
		<segment7>And it feels like we could last forever. And im not doing to do this alone</segment7>
		<segment8>When memories fade. We've got each other. When time and confusion collide. Singin' I hold it all when I hold you. When friends walk other ways. We've got each other. I hold it all when I hold. I hold it all when I hold</segment8>
		<segment9>It's not about the money we make. It's about the passions that we ache for. What makes your heart beat faster. Tell me now what does your body long after</segment9>
		<segment10>I don't care now where we live. It's not where, or what, or who we were with. I just need you in my life. So promise me again..</segment10>
		<segment11>When memories fade. We've got each other. When time and confusion collide. Singin' I hold it all when I hold you. When friends walk other ways. We've got each other. I hold it all when I hold. I hold it all when I hold You    </segment11>
