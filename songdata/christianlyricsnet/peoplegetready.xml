		<segment1>People get ready. There's a train coming. Picking up passengers. From coast to coast. Faith is the key. Open the doors and board 'em. There's room for all. If you'll just love the Lord </segment1>
		<segment2>There ain't no room. For the hopeless sinner. Who would hurt all mankind. Just to save his own. Have pity on those. Whose chances grow thinner. There's no hiding place. Around the kingdon's throne </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. People get ready. There's a train coming. Don't need no ticket. You just get on board. Faith is the key. Open the doors and board 'em. Don't need no ticket. You just thank the Lord     </segment3>
