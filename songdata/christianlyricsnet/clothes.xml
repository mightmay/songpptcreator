		<segment1>Clothes aren't what they used to be. They don't seem to fit you and me, anymore. Modesty is out the door. Flaunting what we've got and more is in. Yeah, it's in </segment1>
		<segment2>They're sayin'. &quot;Don't ask why, just wear what we say. You'll look like a model if you'll only obey. To get the attention, just do what we say&quot; </segment2>
		<segment3>Pay so much for clothes so small. Was this shirt made for me or my doll?. Is this all I get?. I looked so hot but caught a cold. I was doing just what I was told. To fit in</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>We're sayin'. &quot;Let's ask why, don't wear what they say. Don't want to be a model; they can't eat anyway. That kind of attention will fade with the day. So, I'll stand up and say. .</segment5>
		<segment6>Clothes that fit are fine. Won't show what's mine. Don't change my mind. I'll be fine    </segment6>
