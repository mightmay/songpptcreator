		<segment1>Her heart bleeds</segment1>
		<segment2>It is a basis for your heartfelt hunger so gaze. At the page at the faces of nameless.. You're alone again. And this distortion is an apt replacement for. An unquenchable desire for more. More pages strewn across this sickening floor. I can't look at any of this</segment2>
		<segment3>If they saw what those eyes have seen</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh how her heart it would bleed. If she only knew those abusive roots. And how the children would weep. If they only saw what those eyes have seen. It always keeps us longer than we wanted to stay. It always takes us further than we wanted to go. But you don't seem to mind at the time</segment4>
		<segment5>Begging to be set free..from what we were meant to be</segment5>
		<segment6>Innocence</segment6>
		<segment7>It's inside you and your soul is longing, yearning. Pleading to be set free. Within your eyes, within my eyes, within our eyes. There could never be a more complete perversion of what we. were meant to be. And with all that is in me I hate this. As we're sinking inside this ever-feeding illnes. We are all quite silent. Sitting still.     </segment7>
