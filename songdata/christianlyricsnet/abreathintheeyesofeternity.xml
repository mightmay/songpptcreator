		<segment1>Emptiness running through me. Taking all that i am. Leaving me this blinding mask. Grasping for the wind. Everything I've done. Everything I've gained. It all means nothing. A mere breath has passed away. Sadness I embrace. Left with empty promises. I look at myself and see the scars. That are brought to me by this life. Then I ask myself. Is that all this world has to give. The chase is over I am finished. Stripped of every reason I cry out to You. From my knees I scream    </segment1>
