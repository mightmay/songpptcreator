		<segment1>Walking against the wind, pushing the endless road, where will we lay our heads?. Soothing to kiss her lips. Its where we long to be, Chaos and comfort are near.</segment1>
		<segment2>Well run together, Facing the night.</segment2>
		<segment3>Gripping the morning star,</segment3>
		<segment4>Breathing a long relief, watching the houses fade. So now the lines are drawn, and see the blood run cold, what if the world stops spinning?</segment4>
		<segment5>Dont walk away. Nothing to say, just stay here with me, well look back and laugh someday. Dont run away, Lifes got its ways, of bringing you. down, kicking you in the teeth.</segment5>
		<segment6>So give it all some time, at least we have each other. I know well dream.</segment6>
		<segment7>Dont walk away. Nothing to say, just stay here with me, well look back and laugh someday. Dont run away, Lifes got its ways, of bringing you. down, kicking you in the teeth.</segment7>
		<segment8>So give it all some time, at least we have each other. I know well dream.    </segment8>
