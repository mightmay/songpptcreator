		<segment1>Somethin' tells me I'll never be close to another like you. helped me throught the things that we all go through. You make every song sound better, taught me how to write a letter. I think everyone should get along like me and my first stereo</segment1>
		<segment2>oops, I'm in trouble again. should of listened to them. Back to my room and then we're safe now. Feels like when we were ten, in my room listenin. To some Michael Jackson, relaxin'</segment2>
		<segment3>And you used to sing me to sleep. and always stood behind me. you saw me off when I had to go. my first true love was my first stereo</segment3>
		<segment4>Everyone wants, everyone needs, everyone hurts sometimes like me. It never rejects me, always accepts me. nothing can compete with my first stereo. Everyone wants, everyone needs, nobodys perfect just like me. into the stereo is the place I go. I wonder what's playin' next on the radio?</segment4>
		<segment5>Green light, outta my way. seems like just yesterday. that you played me my very first mix tape. Gave me the courage to say what I wanted to say. when it never comes ou that way</segment5>
		<segment6>My First stereo, my first stereo    </segment6>
