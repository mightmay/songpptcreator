		<segment1>If a stone holds you down - keep your head above ground. though the foothold can be merciless. in a world not your own - it's the weight of the stone. holding me, holding you - very fast - quite fast</segment1>
		<segment2>It's not the weight of the stone that's holding you down. it's the way it fascinates your mind. and just because it causes you to fall. don't mean it tempts me very much at all. I can see that it feels like a millstone is tied around your neck. but if you come clean and say &quot;I don't have it together&quot;. you can still keep your faith in check</segment2>
		<segment3>3,7,9,10,12,14 feet - no spineless fellow here. down below 100 more, and not a sign of fear. X marks the spot at 145, a stone dislodged held him fast. how could he know while now alive - 13th day would be his last. they tried and tried to bring him to the surface in vain. if a stone holds you down - keep your head above ground. though the foothold can be merciless</segment3>
		<segment4>For 12 more days - the foothold was merciless. with no possible means of ingress or egress. in the end a paradox was found. the beast that held him was a 10 pound stone. are you afraid - are you afraid?. That where He takes you - is a cold dark lonely place. where it's hard to find his face - hard to find his face. in a world that is not your own</segment4>
		<segment5>in a world not your own - it's not the weight of the stone.     </segment5>
