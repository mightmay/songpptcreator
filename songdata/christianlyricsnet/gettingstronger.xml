		<segment1>I used to lay awake at night. Wondering was I wrong or right. I was a prisoner of my fear. Only you</segment1>
		<segment2>I was a kind of man who'd build a wall. And be the biggest fool of them all. Had a hard time letting go. Till I was broken</segment2>
		<segment3>Look me in the eyes. Tell me what you see. I'm not the same man. That I used to be</segment3>
		<segment4>If you see me on my knees. It's not because I'm weak. I'm getting stronger. If you see me start to cry. You'll know the reason why. I'm getting stronger</segment4>
		<segment5>Well I find myself face to face. In the presence of amazing grace. And I it's all I ever wanted to be. Only you</segment5>
		<segment6>Look me in the heart. Tell me what you see. I'm not the same man. That I used to be</segment6>
		<segment7>If you see me on my knees. It's not because I'm weak. I'm getting stronger. If you see me start to cry. You'll know the reason why. I'm getting stronger</segment7>
