		<segment1>This is my prayer, this is my cry, stay with me, stay with me. When all my world is at your feet</segment1>
		<segment2>You are the only one worth waiting for, worth waiting for. So I will pray and pray that you'll never stop haunting me. You are the only one worth waiting for, worth waiting for. So I get on my knees and cry out to you, oh don't be silent anymore.</segment2>
		<segment3>Where is the voice that could break this stillness, speak to me, speak to me. That I might find you in the silent, speak to me, speak to me. When all my world is at your feet. I have said all I needed to say, wanted to say, how long will it take, how long will it take    </segment3>
