		<segment1>I've stood alone a million times. That's not the same as being alone. I've felt ignored, and left behind before. But that's not the same as being disowned. Open my eyes, and help me see that there's a world outside of me. I'm no different, I want to make a difference tonight. The words don't always come out right. And I don't normally cry. But you didn't see the look in her eyes. I've been shaken. From my head, on down to my toes. Lord use me, take me where you want me to go. I can't help it, my heart has been replaced with a face. I'm ready, these hands are dedicated to change. I've hurt before, but held inside. I've seen their tears, 'cause pain is something they can't hide. What makes us different?. We have a chance to listen tonight    </segment1>
