		<segment1>Verse 1: Searched for you high and low on endless city streets, from New York to New Orleans. Over the mountain tops through hills of Tennessee, I've walked the miles with wounded knee</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah.. Search lights shining everywhere. Yeah. (The ghost on the water he comes, to save us from all of our own)</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Hey You, tell me what you want from me (Hey You). I'll give you everything you need, I don't want to be lost. I just want to be loved by you. Hey You, tell me what you want from me (Hey You). I'm broken and I'm on my knees, I don't want to be lost. I just want to be loved by you</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: I've seen the bullets fly for love and liberty, fighting the war inside of me. My heart has taken sides a battle to believe, the angel armies carry me. Yeah.. Sick and tired of running scared. Yeah. (The ghost on the water he comes, to save us from all of our own)    </segment4>
