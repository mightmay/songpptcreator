		<segment2>good tidings we bring. to you and your kin. good tidings for christmas and a happy new year</segment2>
		<segment3>we wish you a merry christmas. we wish you a merry christmas. we wish you a merry christmas, and a happy new year</segment3>
		<segment4>we wish you a merry christmas. we wish you a merry christmas. we wish you a merry christmas, and a happy new year</segment4>
		<segment5>And so when the words we sing are gone. i pray God's blessing continues on. We laugh and compliment this. Merry Christmas</segment5>
		<segment6>good tidings we bring. to you and your kin. good tidings for christmas and a happy new year</segment6>
