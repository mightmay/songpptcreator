		<segment1>My mind isn't quite sure. What it has bargained for. But my heart is in time with. With the consistent beat.</segment1>
		<segment2>This dream is sneaking up on me. No matter how collected I seem to be. Is anybody ever truly complete?. Or are the better ones just better at believing?</segment2>
		<segment3>So I'll go and say you're with me. I know it's just the beginning.</segment3>
		<segment4>At times I feel cold and exposed under a microscope. But it has never much better to live. It doesn't matter if all my friends latch on to this. There's only one acceptance that's not later dismissed.</segment4>
		<segment5>Just go and say you're with me. I know it's just the beginning.</segment5>
		<segment6>My mind isn't quite sure. What it has bargained for. But my heart is in time with, With the consistent beat of yours.</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm not looking to music to complete me. I'm not looking for a new philosophy. I'm not waiting for somebody to swoon me. I'm just searching for a better way into your love.</segment7>
		<segment8>Can you feel the only eyes that see inside?. Can you feel anything anymore?    </segment8>
