		<segment1>Fear falls out like rain again. Washing over me. You say nothing will ever change. What do I believe. You fall deep inside again. There's nothing left to see. Weakness fills your heart again</segment1>
		<segment2>You put it to rest</segment2>
		<segment3>Hoping everything. You were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. Pray that I will not give up</segment3>
		<segment4>I try to see your face again. A photograph of me. Your voice calling out again. Nothing left for me. You try to find your place again. Waiting just to breathe. Weakness takes your heart again</segment4>
		<segment5>You put it to rest</segment5>
		<segment6>Locked inside again. Locked inside again. Locked inside again</segment6>
		<segment7>Hoping everything. You were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. Pray that I will not give up. Hoping everything. You were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. Pray that I will not give up</segment7>
		<segment8>Did you. Forget about the things I said. Right the lies inside your head. I never tried to bring you down</segment8>
		<segment9>Kill the pain and emptyness. Find your love and lose yourself. Well i hope that your just a memory</segment9>
		<segment10>Locked inside again. Locked inside again. Locked inside again</segment10>
		<segment11>Holding everything. You were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. Pray that I will not give up. Hoping everything. You were never strong enough. Close my eyes again. Pray that I will not give up    </segment11>
