		<segment1>Arise all ye warriors. A battle we must win. Be shielded in His Glory. Let the fighting begin. Put on the holy armor. It's time to take control. Come along with me to fight for the lost souls. . Atop the hills we cry &quot;victory is ours&quot;. We're never turning back to our lifestyles of worthless sin. Hear our prayers. We pour our hearts to you. Oh, Lord. As we cry victory!. March along in valor and shout this battle hymn. We're armored and we're ready to put satan to an end. With God's Word as a sword there's nothing we can't do. Allow Him to command you and see what happens too. There's power of His Love. Strength from up above. Feel the brunt of our attack. Because our past is never coming back.    </segment1>
