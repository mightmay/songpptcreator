		<segment2>This is what it is. This is who I am. This is where I finally take my stand. I didn't wanna fall. But I don't have to crawl. I met the One with two scarred hands. Giving Him the best of. Everything that's left of. The life inside this man. I've been born again</segment2>
		<segment3>I see ya walking like you're living in fear. Having trouble even looking at me. Wishing they would give you more than words. Sick of people telling how it should be. What'd ya download?
