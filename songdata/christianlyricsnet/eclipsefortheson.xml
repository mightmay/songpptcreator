		<segment1>I've been running nowhere street. I've got to mend my bloody feet. I've thrown away ten thousand days. I've hidden black and white and painted gray</segment1>
		<segment2>In my weakness, out of pride. I failed to see the other side. It's a lost and broken war. That I won't fight for anymore</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. Where did I go wrong?. A shattered life, a wasted song. I composed, I lived and wrote each one. What is destiny?. To Live and Love and Die Honorably. So I'll trade My Eclipse for The Son</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to make a difference. I want my life to make some sense. Cause when it's all over. I will have to answer for myself</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm tearing down my rotten fence. And burying my weak defense. I want to crossover. Its time to take my heart off of the shelf</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus].     </segment6>
