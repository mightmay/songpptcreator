		<segment1>Is God asking you to crawl to China - or just to cross the street?. to trudge through the desert through Arabian heat. or to accomplish the impossible - an Herculean feat. or maybe just trade in bad thoughts obsolete</segment1>
		<segment2>Is it the concentration camps at Dackow?. is it Joan of Arc revisited?. Niagara Falls in a barrel?. or to mend a broken relationship instead?</segment2>
		<segment3>Crawl to China</segment3>
		<segment4>He is faithful - it remains in His hands. from the cold barren Arctic to the war stricken lands. from the place in your heart where despair takes its hold. to the lairs of the demons where deceptions are told. is God asking you to crawl to China or just to cross the street?</segment4>
		<segment5>Crawl to China</segment5>
		<segment6>With emotional rigormortis freezing your step. you won't be going far at all. it feels pretty safe but the danger is real. you won't grow until you face the fear that you feel</segment6>
		<segment7>Crawl to China     </segment7>
