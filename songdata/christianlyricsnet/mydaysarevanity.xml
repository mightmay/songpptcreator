		<segment1>My tongue has grown heavy, with the things I cannot say. Lost in this world of blue, black, and grey, I've tasted hell, as it came for me. Should I live or die, I can't decide, contemplating my life, as I think about the end. Should I take it all away from myself, saving me from all this pain and decit. My heart will fall from the sky and shatter on the ground, shards of blood will pour out, into this letter. Should I live or die, I can't decide, contemplating my life, should I end it all myself. Taking it all away from me, and save myself from this bitterness and pain. My heart will fall from the sky and shatter on the ground, shards of blood will pour out, into this letter, that I leave behind telling the reasons why I chose. To hide, hide in death, wrap myself up in this darkness and cold. There's no turning back, holding your breath, waving goodbye. There's no turning back, holding your breath, waving goodbye again    </segment1>
