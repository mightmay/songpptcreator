		<segment1>You are Holy. God of the Heavens. Almighty. Lord of Creation. You have power. The universe displays. All things fade away. But You remain</segment1>
		<segment2>And Your mercies stretch across my life. As far as I can see. And I know from experience that You are good indeed. I stand here in amazement of your awesome majesty. For words cannot describe oh God. Everything You are to me</segment2>
		<segment3>You are Father. You called me Your very own. My redeemer. You left heaven's throne. My ransom. With blood for me You paid. One day unashamed. I'll see Your face</segment3>
		<segment4>Indescribably good. Lord that's what You are to me. You are making me into. Just what You want me to be</segment4>
		<segment5>You are Jesus. And I love You    </segment5>
