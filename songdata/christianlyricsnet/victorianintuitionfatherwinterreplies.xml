		<segment1>your waistcoat high. into self absorption, deviation. no victorian intuition</segment1>
		<segment2>can't find the switch. to the light bulb of concentration. no victorian, no victorian, no victorian, no victorian intuition</segment2>
		<segment3>out of tune, unfit for singing. oh, it's alright. nothing's changed then. right beside my four eyed pretties. oh, it's all right, they forgive me</segment3>
		<segment4>collectively we sigh. father winter replies. time beds to meet our cries. father winter replies. hasty, hasty, how to simmer?. first, read the words, then consider. pinch of salt, a spoon of patience, to be complete when he's finished</segment4>
		<segment5>clutch all your false diagrams. proof for malnutrition. no victorian intuition</segment5>
		<segment6>your prevent what you have. to prove all your inclinations. no victorian, no victorian. no victorian, no victorian intuition    </segment6>
