		<segment1>Hey, it's me again. Just the one I didn't want to see. A confrontation I would rather avoid. </segment1>
		<segment2>It's in my skin always tryin' to trip me up from within. I checked with me I think I'm getting annoyed. </segment2>
		<segment3>What do I want from me, my eyes are wide but my mind is blurry, overshaken I'm just fading away. </segment3>
		<segment4>What did I want to see, a little more junk for my flesh to feed on, overshaken I'm just fading away. Here I am rollin' round the dirt again. </segment4>
		<segment5>It's just the kind of pain I like to endure. But, when I fall and make myself sick again, there's always One that's there to give the cure. </segment5>
		<segment6>What do I want from me, my eyes are wide but my mind is blurry, overshaken I'm just fading away. </segment6>
		<segment7>What did I want to see, a little more junk for my flesh to feed on, overshaken I'm just fading away. Hey, it's me again. Just the one I didn't want to see, but everywhere I go I'm already there. </segment7>
		<segment8>What do I want from me, my eyes are wide but my mind is blurry, overtaken I'm just fading away. What did I want to see, a little more junk for my flesh to feed on, overtaken I'm just fading away.    </segment8>
