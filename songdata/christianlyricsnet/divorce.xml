		<segment1>She's breaking up, she's falling down. She's holding her fists up now. Her eyes meet my face but we don't look the Same. She walks away, on bloody knees. Her swollen face hides her tears. My mind strains for words but my tongue won't obey</segment1>
		<segment2>You're just a shadow now of the girl I used to know. Your broken song is maimed and slow. You strain your face to bear that smile. Your teeth clenched tightly all the while. and though you search so thoroughly. for some place to put the blame. It only rests on angry shoulders. and you don't look the same. Your pretty face now contorted. haggard with shame. I try to recognize your anger. I try to recognize your hatred. I try to find some purpose for your pride</segment2>
		<segment3>So cease your screaming now because your. voice is worn and hoarse. your song insinuates divorce. your poison love I won't pursue. your not the lover I once knew. and though you speak so firmly of maxims so bold. your lips mouth words of love. but still your voice is callused and cold. I try to understand what made this mess unfold. I'm sure you couldn't be blamed. your features haven't changed. and yet I can't Imagine why you don't look the same</segment3>
		<segment4>and your song of broken trust is grating on my ears. I'm tired of standing passive while you're preying on my fears. I'm tired of trying to fight, I'm tired of taking sides. you say that you're not angry but I see it in your eyes. I'm tired of hearing rumors, I'm tired of hiding shame. I'm tired of pointing fingers and never taking blame. I'm tired of trying to talk I've nothing left to say. I'm tired of going on so I'm going away    </segment4>
