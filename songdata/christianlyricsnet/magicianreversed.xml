		<segment1>The King has made a plan. He was playing with her hair. He couldn't tell if what he felt was violence speaking out. The bright lit discoveratory was absently loud. It made her squirm, she said-. &quot;War, I never knew your hands could move so quick. Your golden arrows sing. Your golden arrows sing. I'll format your lips.&quot;. Don't ever speak of stars. If you formed from different parts. Cause you know I lied there drunk that night. With the armour at my side. I left it for several seconds. But it's just enough to tear my spine, I said-. &quot;War, I never knew your hands could move so quick. Your golden arrows sing. Your golden arrows sing. I'll format your lips.&quot;. Still you watch the golden lines.. War, I never knew your hands could move so quick. Your golden arrows sing. Your golden arrows sing. I'll format your lips. And with this being witnessed, our character now has learned that fools are being taught to hate.. Now what's this you say about those sleeping children?    </segment1>
