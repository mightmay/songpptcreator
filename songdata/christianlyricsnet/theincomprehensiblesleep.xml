		<segment1>Our lives up to this point have lead to this. A garden in the dark, a deadly kiss (Matthew 36:47-49). If you want to follow me. Well walk into suffering. Its this act that will distinguish us</segment1>
		<segment2>My disciples, those Ive chosen (John 15:16). Dont listen to the sirens. Dont you know that I would never lead you astray. Tie yourself to the mast and cover your ears with wax and. Keep your gaze on me, for Gods sake stay awake</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes you have to close your eyes to see. Sometimes to walk you have to get down on your knees. All I ask is that you pray. All I ask is that you stay awake. But your dreams betray me</segment3>
		<segment4>My disciples, those Ive chosen. Dont listen to the sirens. Dont you know that I would never lead you astray. Tie yourself to the mast and cover your ears with wax and. Keep your gaze on me, for Gods sake stay awake</segment4>
		<segment5>Wake up.</segment5>
		<segment6>Are you resting? Are you still asleep?</segment6>
		<segment7>Wake Up, O Sleeper (Ephesians 5:14). Wake Up and say a prayer. Wake Up, O Sleeper. Are you my betrayer?. Wake up, O Sleeper. Wake up, O Sleeper. Incomprehensible, Incomprehensible     </segment7>
