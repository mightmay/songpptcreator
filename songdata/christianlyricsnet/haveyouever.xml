		<segment1>Have you ever wanted to be someone else. Have you ever wanted just to be someone. Have you ever wanted to reach your dreams. Have you ever wanted life to be more than it seems. I have tasted of a love so wide. That it stops all my time. I have tasted of a love so deep. That it blows my mind. Have you ever wanted to reach up and touch the sky. Have you ever wanted to pack it up and say good-bye. Have you ever wanted someone to care. Have you ever wanted someone to be there. He is sweet, He is sweet. What your looking for. Is my sweet, sweet Jesus. What You're looking for. Is my sweet Lord    </segment1>
