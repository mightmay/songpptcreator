		<segment1>I remember mama praying, saying to me, girl. Child, you better know before you walk out in the world. Times are getting darker, getting hotter everyday. When they do, I hear mama say</segment1>
		<segment2>As you get older, when it's cold you run towards the sun. If you feel scare and so alone you're not the only one. Don't be afraid when your world comes undone. Don't you know that someday our King will come?</segment2>
		<segment3>As I keep growing, He keeps showing me strength. Even when the world is changing He will stay the same. He loves me like a father and this hands will provide. Takes away every fear inside</segment3>
		<segment4>As you get older, when it's cold you run towards the sun. If you feel scare and so alone you're not the only one. Don't be afraid when your world comes undone. Don't you know that someday our King will come?</segment4>
		<segment5>All the time has passed, days to months to years. When we hear His voice He'll open every deafening. Everybody's gonna hear you</segment5>
		<segment6>As you get older, when it's cold keep running towards the sun. You're not alone, you're not the only one. Don't be afraid when your world comes undone. Don't you know that someday, someday our King's gonna come?</segment6>
		<segment7>As you get older, when it's cold you run towards the sun. If you feel scare and so alone you're not the only one. Don't be afraid when your world comes undone. Someday I know our King's gonna come</segment7>
		<segment8>Someday, someday, our King will come. Someday, someday, someday. Don't be afraid. Someday our King will come</segment8>
		<segment9>Sing it now. Someday, someday, someday. He's gonna come again. Someday, someday, someday. He's coming back for me</segment9>
		<segment10>Someday our King will come. Someday our King will come. Someday our King will come    </segment10>
