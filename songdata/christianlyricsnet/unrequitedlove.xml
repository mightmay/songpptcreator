		<segment1>So write it down in lover's blood. There's gotta be a better way to break this spell. Send out a search party. Have you forgot how to love or how to die. I see the crosses behind your eyes. When will the fire burn out. Is it after we've covered our tracks. I'm not going to stay to find out. He never asked for much. If the fire burns out will it ever light up again. It's been so long since I've seen your eyes this cold. When did you let them step in. When did you let them take control. So sound the alarm!. There's gotta be a better way to break this spell. Tell the whole world that I left without his love at the chiming of the bells. I've been dreaming of elaborate schemes. Thoughts the love was good for a while. It's been much easier to leave. I've got a new life now. This couldn't have come at a worse time. I guess you had to find out about this unrequited love that I deny. You say you fell out of love. Well I call this abandonment!.     </segment1>
