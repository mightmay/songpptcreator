		<segment1>Did you think you were made for all the things. That felt like a waste. Or has everything led you to be. What you have never foreseen</segment1>
		<segment2>Everything I see reminds me. Of just how beautiful you can be. I'm waiting for a feeling. That would make love open my eyes. Remind me I'm alive</segment2>
		<segment3>This Seattle life, it has changed me from the inside. Changed me from the inside. It has magnified all my cries. For something more than fine</segment3>
		<segment4>Now we see that everything we have. And everything we lack. Is exactly what we need. Every single day. Everything we've made. Has put us in this place in just this way    </segment4>
