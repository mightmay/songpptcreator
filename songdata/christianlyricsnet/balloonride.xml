		<segment1>There were times in my life when I was confused. There were things between me and God that were blocking my view. So I prayed, &quot;Oh dear Lord, take these things away so I can see.&quot;. He answered my prayer and at the sight of Him. I fell to my knees.</segment1>
		<segment2>And until I went onto that fateful trip. I thought I was on a sinking ship.</segment2>
		<segment3>Until, I went on a balloon ride. (I could see everything from up there). I went on a balloon ride. And now everything seems clear.</segment3>
		<segment4>I strive towards infinity. Though sometimes I don't know what to do. When other people laugh at me. All I do is look towards You.</segment4>
		<segment5>Well on my through this life yet something was gone. I looked round and round and then I found I needed some one. So I prayed, &quot;Oh dear Lord, fill me up and make me whole. Present in my life Jesus Christ, save my soul.&quot;    </segment5>
