		<segment1>I'm gonna leave this place, I swear this time I'm running home. I know this place too well that promises I'll be alone. Somewhere between here and there and back and forth I'll come around.</segment1>
		<segment2>It's what I want to tell you.. it's been so very long. since I've been man enough to be the kind of man.. if I'm gonna hold your hand.</segment2>
		<segment3>I was reminded of the lack of who I am, swallowed hard. And in the night I took a firefly or a shooting star. I watched the sun come up and burn away this feeling over me. It'll be ok, you'll see.</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]. ..to be the kind of man I'm supposed to be. [CHORUS]    </segment4>
