		<segment1>The chief priests required the tomb to be secured. The Pharisees were with them, Pilate was assure. There would be no rising, as He had said. On the third day, from the dead</segment1>
		<segment2>Now after the Sabbath, first day of the week. Mary went down to the tomb, there was a great quake. And an angel descended to roll back the stone. To serve almighty Jesus who sits now on the throne</segment2>
		<segment3>His countenance like lightning, His clothing white as snow. The guards shook in fear of Him, as dead men they did know. He had risen as it is to this day, all false religions this they will not say. Once Lucifer, now Satan, shaking in his boots, was totally defeated right to the roots</segment3>
		<segment4>The Son of Man was delivered into the hands of sinful men. To be crucified, and on the third day rise again</segment4>
		<segment5>This is the basis for the Christian creed. There was a resurrection, the truth on which we feed. If you choose to reject it you'll face judgement in the end. And He proved all He said by raising from the dead</segment5>
		<segment6>This was no deception as some have said. Jesus Christ the victor, raised from the dead. The total penalty of sin is our only claim to fame. And repentance and remission of it is only by His name</segment6>
		<segment7>He is risen!    </segment7>
