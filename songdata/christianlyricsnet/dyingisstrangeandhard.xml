		<segment1>I have my pictures of you, you don't look back at me. a smile I'd almost forgotten, bruises I don't see. never forgive you for a sky turned from gray to black. come out and kiss me, darling. I promise I'll kiss you back.</segment1>
		<segment2>a new head on my shoulder, a needle in my ear. every kind word brings new pain. instead of my eyes, her reflection in the mirror.</segment2>
		<segment3>I have a sickness, but I'm not the only one. even in health .. in eachother's arms, they're wasting away. sickened just as I am and crippled with disease. a song comes from above. I look up -- there's a tree and a small brown bird. even the sparrows have built a nest. but we, poor fools, have built nothing. what a shame not to know that you're dying. tell us we're dying, tell us again.</segment3>
		<segment4>I have a sickness. the sparrows built a nest. my crippled, twisted body is swallowed by the earth. as my broken head finds rest.    </segment4>
