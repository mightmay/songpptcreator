		<segment1>Sometimes I feel like this world. Is just one big, gigantic merry-go-round. You gotta hold on tight. Or you get hurled thru the air</segment1>
		<segment2>Yea, life is a 3 ring circus. With clowns and freaks and camels and such. And you never know when you might be. Attacked by the bears</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Give me love, give me love. Love me good</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes I feel like I'm afraid. of my own shadow and then. Sometimes I can feel as bold as Genghis Khan. But I could never live in a yurt. On a diet of Mongolian barbecue. I conquer the world for a moment. Then the moment is gone</segment4>
		<segment5>Let us take a moment now to bow our heads and pray. If only to give thanks for making it thru another day</segment5>
		<segment6>Sometimes I wish I was in a movie. Or some 70s TV thing. Where everything gets neatly. wrapped by the end of the show</segment6>
		<segment7>Yea, but this ain't Hollywood. And this sure ain't the Brady Bunch. How this plot's gonna all pan out. I don't really know     </segment7>
