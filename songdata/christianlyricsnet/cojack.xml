		<segment1>Once apon a time I dreamt that you were mine. But I never expected that dream to come true. And now you're in my arms, and we're walking to your home. And all I can think about is you. Hey, do you have to go away just yet? Hey wait I think I really must confess that you looked really good last night. Last night. Last night. We talked about this think that only God could bring into our lonely lives. And you and I've just seen we fit together perfectly. And now I'm doin' alright. Hey, do you have to go away just yet? Hey wait I think I really must confess that you looked really good last night. Last night. Last night. Last night. Last night. Last night. Last night.    </segment1>
