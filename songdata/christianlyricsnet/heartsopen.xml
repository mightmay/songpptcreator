		<segment1>Looking back on how my life pulls up and down, I can see the care you took in pulling me out, And with that voice you shook me up enough to see. I need to be sure of the ground on which I am standing.</segment1>
		<segment2>With weights around your feet you can't run, The race, the father waits.</segment2>
		<segment3>Everyone here can be sure of one thing, We're all in need, we're all in need. Our souls are aching but our hearts are open, We're all in need, we're all in need.</segment3>
		<segment4>We're so focused on the sins of our friends, We forgot forgiveness, it's so much easier to. Cast a judgment, we've forgotten where our hope is, You'll find us throwing stones and spitting cusses.</segment4>
		<segment5>With weights around your feet you can't run, The race, the father waits.</segment5>
		<segment6>Everyone here can be sure of one thing, We're all in need, we're all in need. Our souls are aching but our hearts are open, We're all in need, we're all in need.</segment6>
		<segment7>Now I see how much you mean, Now I see how much you mean to me.</segment7>
		<segment8>All your love covers all the worst of me.</segment8>
		<segment9>Everyone here can be sure of one thing, We're all in need, we're all in need. Our souls are aching but our hearts are open, We're all in need, we're all in need.</segment9>
		<segment10>Thank you Father, thank you. For all you are, you're all I need. Thank you Father, thank you. For all you are, you're all I need.    </segment10>
