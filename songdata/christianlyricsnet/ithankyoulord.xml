		<segment1>It's a hurry up world and my days go flying by. But I don't want to forget to thank you for my life. And in my blindness you give eyes to see. That in my struggle you will fight for me. So from my heart I've got to say</segment1>
		<segment2>(I thank you Lord) I thank you Father for the gift of your Son. (I thank you Lord) I thank you Jesus for the things you have done. (I thank you Lord) I thank you spirit for the peace that is here in my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Long before I was born, I belonged to you alone. You have always been there, I was never on my own. And I feel your presence in my darkest hour. When I am weakest then I know your power. You are the light that shines in me</segment3>
		<segment4>(I thank you Lord) I thank you Father for the gift of your son. (I thank you Lord) I thank you Jesus for the things you have done. (I thank you Lord) I thank you Spirit for the peace that is here in my heart</segment4>
		<segment5>Nobody cares for me like you. Cuz nobody loves the way you do. You're faithful and true. You saw me drowning and you rescued me. You know I've got to say</segment5>
		<segment6>(I thank you Lord) I thank you Father for the gift of your son. (I thank you Lord) I thank you Jesus for the things you have done. (I thank you Lord) I thank you Spirit for the peace that is here in my heart</segment6>
