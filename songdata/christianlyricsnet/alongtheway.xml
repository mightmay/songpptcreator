		<segment1>Would You ever want to walk with me, would You ever want to talk with me today?. Would You ever think with me and stop to ponder life along the way?. And I know it's going to be alright. The sun will rise and I'll be walking on. And I say the wind will blow wherever it wants but I'll be holding on. You woke me up at five am to pull me up to where You are. Now I'm here with You, the world is coming into view and I can see Your thoughts right now. It's going to be alright. The sun will rise and I'll be walking on. And I say the wind will blow wherever it wants but I'll be holding on. Don't fear the wind, don't fear the waves, He's stronger. Never fear the night, never fear the days, He's brighter.     </segment1>
