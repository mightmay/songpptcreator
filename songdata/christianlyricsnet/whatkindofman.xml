		<segment1>How many would do the same?. You die so others gain. Even for the ones who hate. For the soul of your name</segment1>
		<segment2>Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me?. What kind of man would die to set us free?</segment2>
		<segment3>Your love, your word, your fight. Cuz they rob you of your life. Whom of you would still cry. For the souls of the men who spear at your side?</segment3>
		<segment4>Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me?. What kind of man would die to set us free?. What kind of man would die for you and me?</segment4>
		<segment5>Wait now, it's not quite that simple. You just ask yourself. There are times where the answer seems so far away</segment5>
		<segment6>Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me?. What kind of man would die to set us free?. What kind of man would die for you and me?. Tell me, what kind of man would die for you and me?.     </segment6>
