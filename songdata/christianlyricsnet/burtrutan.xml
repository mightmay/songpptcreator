		<segment1>Split the blackened sky, open flood gates wide. With just one little cry you open up your eyes. We live like whores. We're killing dreams for little boys and little girls. It's our nation, we were living for the day. On our way to devastation in the fires we play. Awakes the frozen souls, burn the idol bulls. Our lips pressed to the coal, a glowing cinder makes us whole. We wash our hands. Of all the blood from innocence that we have shed    </segment1>
