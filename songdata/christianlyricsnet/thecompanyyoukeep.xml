		<segment1>Another day to be dumb, confusion mingled with bliss. A bit of revelation that I don't want to miss. I heard bad company kills and absolutely it's true. But then that doesn't explain all that I know about You. That You call me Your own. Never leave me alone I think I should warn You. You're getting in deep. With the company You keep</segment1>
		<segment2>So while my dinner gets done I'm reading Your history. You've got a reputation and all the people You see. Are a dangerous crowd they're an unsavory sort. Though I can't say it too loud I heard an evil report. The fool and the friendless. The liar and thief. The presence of greatness. In the company of the least.    </segment2>
