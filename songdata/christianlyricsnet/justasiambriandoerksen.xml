	<english>
		<segment1>Just as I am, without one plea, But that Thy blood was shed for me, And that Thou bidst me come to Thee, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</segment1>
		<segment2>Just as I am, and waiting not. To rid my soul of one dark blot, To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</segment2>
		<segment3>Just as I am, though tossed about. With many a conflict, many a doubt, Fightings and fears within, without, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</segment3>
		<segment4>Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;. Sight, riches, healing of the mind, Yea, all I need in Thee to find, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</segment4>
		<segment5>Just as I am, Thou wilt receive, Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;. Because Thy promise I believe, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</segment5>
		<segment6>Just as I am, Thy love unknown. Hath broken every barrier down;. Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone, O Lamb of God, I come, I come.</segment6>
		<segment7>Just as I am, of that free love, The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove, Here for a season, then above, O Lamb of God, I come, I come!    </segment7>
