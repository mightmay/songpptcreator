		<segment1>He's brought me here. Where things are clear. And trials turn to gold. He's shared with me. His victory. He won in days of old. Oh Lord, i don't deserve. The riches of Your world. But You changed my filthy rags. To linen white as snow</segment1>
		<segment2>The view from here. Is nothing near. To what it is for You. I've tried to see. Your plan for me. But i only acted like i knew. Oh Lord, forgive the times. I've tried to read your mind. Cuase You said if i'd be still. Then i would hear Your voice</segment2>
		<segment3>My Lord, my King. My urge to sing. And praise the things above. Now words could say. The glorious way. You've changed me with Your love. He's brought me here. Where things are clear. And trials turned to gold    </segment3>
