		<segment1>Packing my bags this morning. Was the hardest thing to do. But packing my bags was so easy. Compared to standing outside your door right now. to say goodbye to you</segment1>
		<segment2>Think of me. I know you've never seen me cry. Think of me. But it's so hard to say goodbye. Think of me. What can I say to show you. I'll never give up on you. I will be waiting for you</segment2>
		<segment3>I will be there when you call. I will see you through it all. And even in your darkest hour. I pray that the Lord we found. Will set you on solid ground</segment3>
		<segment4>I know that is feels like leaving. Is a part of letting go. But I'm praying with hope and believing. That I'll see you once again down this road. I hope that it won't be long</segment4>
		<segment5>Think of me. I know God brought you as a friend. Think of me. I know He'll bring you back again. Think of me. What can I say to show you. I'll never give up on you. I will be waiting for you</segment5>
		<segment6>Think of me. I know you've never seen me cry. Think if me. But it's so hard to say goodbye. Think of me. What can I say to show you. I'll never give up on you. I will be waiting for you    </segment6>
