		<segment1>I've sinned, come on my knees. For I'm not worthy of Your love. How could You die for me. Such grace can only come from God</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh Lord, You search and You know me. You see me inside out. God, You alone can forgive me. Erase my fear and my doubt. Father, You pick me up. I feel like a child in Your arms. I don't deserve this love, but I hear Your voice, Lord Jesus</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Go and sin no more. He said &quot;I will not condemn you, I'll forgive and I'll forget it all. Go and sin no more. My child, let me remind you it. is I who'll lead and guide you as you go&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>You are my purpose - You are the reason that I live. I want to be like You - Help me to love and to forgive. God, let me not be distracted. Lord, help me focus on You. Keep sin from ruling my, Lord - make me holy and pure. Father, You pick me up - I feel like a child in Your arms. I don't deserve this love but, I hear Your voice Lord, Jesus</segment4>
