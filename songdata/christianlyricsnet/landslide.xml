		<segment1>Verse 1: Fault lines are sure to break feel the avalanche coming as the body shakes. The river tide rises high when the rain falls. The seasons are screaming red skies in the morning, see the signs</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Livin on a Landslide with a one way ticket that I'm sure to ride in my time. Livin on a Landslide every day given is on borrowed time no free ride</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Tongue tied a graveyard mind the downfall. Flood water soul declined the wreckage swallows. New days are coming as old things pass away beneath the landslide.. Landslide.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus 2: Livin on a Landslide with a one way ticket that I'm sure to ride in my time. Livin on a Landslide every day given is on borrowed time no free ride</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge/Outro: Run Run Run where will you go? When your ground gives way. Run Run Run just letting go, the landslide drains away    </segment5>
