		<segment1>We drove through misty canyons. Our destination seemed resolved. But through highbeams tragedy called</segment1>
		<segment2>It seemed like a normal evening. We rode in silent walls between. Our wills, like guillotines</segment2>
		<segment3>I sped on mountain roads as. Your words came piercing through my chest. I'm your usual suspect</segment3>
		<segment4>I turned my head in defense. That's when I heard you crash</segment4>
		<segment5>In siren screams like rival factions. Two stories are told. We never knew at any moment. We might just implode</segment5>
		<segment6>They're watching you crashing into. Crashing into me. And wishing they had what we see. Had what we see. Had what we believe</segment6>
		<segment7>We were magnetic fields when. We came together long ago. You glowed like burning halos</segment7>
		<segment8>But we spent a lifetime on the. Beaches of Normandy in vain. What for I can't explain</segment8>
		<segment9>I looked to you from the darkened highway. Facing you in tears. And in that moment, metal twisted. And you disappeared</segment9>
		<segment10>They're watching you crashing into. Crashing into me. And wishing they had what we see. Had what we see. Had what we believe</segment10>
		<segment11>A fatal evening's drive is what they always will assume. But I know better as I collide face first with you.     </segment11>
