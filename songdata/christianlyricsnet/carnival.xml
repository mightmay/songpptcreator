		<segment1>Oh, this is a thing called ska. Move over Satan, I'm a God blessed sinner. Try chewing on the bread of life, that's what's for dinner. I gotta stand my ground, gotta hold the fort. Gotta pray hard because life's too short. Spirit tastes great but the worlds less filling. You can be all you can be but you gotta be willing. The operators standing by, He's waiting for your call. You know your soul is grungy, He's. the stain lifter that's all</segment1>
		<segment2>Get funky!. Pick it up!. I've tried it on my own, I can't just do it. But now I'm in good hands. And I know He'll see me through it. If you can't say this, get a piece of the Rock. I say, time is runnin' out- tick tock, tick tock. Many times in life you're gonna take a lickin'. But when Jesus Christ has your back,</segment2>
		<segment3>You're gonna keep on tickin'. Tickin' like a time bomb that's waiting to explode. Without pain and streets of gold is. where you're gonna go!. Can you feel it?. Ah, yeah!. Here comes that grove. Let's see ya move. Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!. Ska, ska, ska, ska!    </segment3>
