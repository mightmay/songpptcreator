		<segment1>You are a jewel, virtue, treasure. Angelic in heart, painting grace. </segment1>
		<segment2>With every passing moment, I'm falling in love with you. </segment2>
		<segment3>You're my morning song and evening lullaby. Your kindness is killing me. Your soft words will be my ending. </segment3>
		<segment4>You are the one I love the most. It's you I'll love forever. You are the one that I adore. With your extraordinary love. I'm finding it so easy. To fall in love with you. </segment4>
		<segment5>This three-strand cord shall not be broken. If Jesus is the center. And as this ring has no end, Neither shall my love    </segment5>
