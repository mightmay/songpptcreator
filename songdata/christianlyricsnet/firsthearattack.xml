		<segment1>Listen I'll tell you a story. Of lines you never get back. This is a reason to worry. The trials that make you a man </segment1>
		<segment2>It's when I have my first heart attack. And I can't even breathe. You tell the truth, I know you wouldn't lie. That I'm on my last beat </segment2>
		<segment3>So listen I'll tell you a story. Of trials that made me a man. This is a long destination. So try as long as you can </segment3>
		<segment4>It's when I have my first heart attack. And I can't even breathe. You tell the truth, I know you wouldn't lie. That I'm on my last beat.     </segment4>
