		<segment1>I cant wait to get out of here. I cant fake through this pain I feel. Its been too long, that Ive been gone. Now Im coming back, Im coming back. So long, its gone. This burden that I carry</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]: And Ill give it all to You, to You. And Ill give it all to You, to You, to You, to You</segment2>
		<segment3>And I'll wade out and the waves are bigger. I cant sort through all this junk so I surrender. And Ive gone on, way too long. Now Ive had enough, Ill give it up to you. This storm is great, but You are so much greater</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>I cant wait to see you standing there so bright and special. And all the waves that crashed around my head. Fall silent at the whisper of your voice</segment5>
		<segment6>And Ill give it all to You, all to You, all to You..     </segment6>
