		<segment1>That you would leave Your throne. And make this world Your home. Forsaking majesty. Embracing mundane. And all of its shame</segment1>
		<segment2>You walked our dusty streets. Healing a world in need. You looked into the eyes. Of sinners like me. Setting us free</segment2>
		<segment3>What wondrous love is this. What wondrous love is this. That You would lay aside Your glory for my soul. What wondrous love is this. What wondrous love is this. That You would lay down Your life for my soul</segment3>
		<segment4>Enduring agony. You bore the cross for me. Betrayed by those You love. You took all our blame. Bearing our pain</segment4>
		<segment5>They nailed Your feet. They nailed Your hands. You are the God. Who understands. You know rejection. Loss and grief. You loved a world. That nailed You to a tree    </segment5>
