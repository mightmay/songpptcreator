		<segment1>I've got a wound that doesn't heal, Burning out again, Burning out again</segment1>
		<segment2>I've not sure which of me is real, And I'm alone again, Burning out again</segment2>
		<segment3>My hope runs underneath it all, The day that I'll be home</segment3>
		<segment4>It won't be long, I belong, Somewhere past the setting sun</segment4>
		<segment5>Find me free, find me strong, Somewhere back where I belong</segment5>
		<segment6>Something shared with me again, But I'm not buying it, I'm not buying it</segment6>
		<segment7>My wound goes deeper than the skin, There's no hiding it, So I'm not trying it</segment7>
		<segment8>My hope runs underneath it all, The day that I'll be home,</segment8>
		<segment9>It won't be long, I belong, Somewhere past the setting sun, Find me free, find me strong, Somewhere back where I belong</segment9>
		<segment10>Yeah, Yeah, (Somewhere past the setting sun!)</segment10>
		<segment11>Yeah, Yeah, (Going back where we belong!)</segment11>
		<segment12>Yeah, Yeah, (I'll find you). (The setting sun!)</segment12>
		<segment13>Let the weak say I am strong, and it won't be long, Let the right say I was wrong, and it won't be long. Let us find where we belong, Beyond the setting sun, Beyond the setting sun</segment13>
		<segment14>It won't be long, I belong, Somewhere past the setting sun, Find me free, find me strong, Somewhere back where I belong    </segment14>
