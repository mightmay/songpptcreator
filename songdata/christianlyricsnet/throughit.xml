		<segment1>I got this friend. And every once in a while. He's been known to live. In a little denial. The trouble he faces. He negotiates his way around. So he often evades it. Right up 'til this time. There's no room for denying. This hill is much to big to climb</segment1>
		<segment2>And I can't get over it. And I can't go under it. And I can't go around it. I gotta go through it</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe you know someone like me. Maybe the mirror is reminding. That this going through. We never would choose. But there is very, very good news. We are never left alone. To journey on our own. He is before, He goes behind. And right beside us</segment3>
		<segment4>When we can't go over it. And we can't go under it. And we can't go around it. We gotta go through it</segment4>
		<segment5>Through the fire and the rain. Every step every inch You go with me. When we go through it. And when I lose the light of day. And the darkness overcomes my way. I will never be afraid</segment5>
		<segment6>When I can't get over it. And I can't go under it. And when I can't go around it. And I can't get over it. And I can't go under it. And I can't go around it. I gotta go through it</segment6>
		<segment7>Through the fire and the rain. Every step, every inch You go with me. When we go through it    </segment7>
