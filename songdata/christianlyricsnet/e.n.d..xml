Perdition's child, I was led astray.. I had no friends, they all turned away.. Is there anyone there who can hear my cry?. I hear no one, so I'll say goodbye.. Goodbye.. My life will end, I want no more.. I cry out loud, Lord save my soul.. Can't you see the pain in my eyes, sorrowful but I don't want to die.. Chorus:. Been hurt so much, I don't want to live.. Not a shred of hope, I can never forgive. (x2). A spider's web of twisted dreams.. The end must come or so it seems.. To take my life by any means!. Can I regain my hopes and dreams?. My dreams.. My life will end, I want no more.. I cry out loud, Lord save my soul.. Can't you see the pain in my eyes, sorrowful but I don't want to die.. (Chorus x2). Hope enters in, Christ save my life.. I won't give in, to Satan's lies.. Now there is Someone to hear my cries,. I'm a child of God and I don't have to die.. To die! My life won't end and I'm not alone.. I praise out loud Christ is on the throne.. Gave me hope and a reason to be, once was blind but now I see.. Chorus:. God gave his Son.. So that I may live.. A ray hope, now I can forgive.. God gave his Son so that I may live,. I've got a hope and a reason to live. (x2). To Live.. (John 3:3-16, Romans 10:9-13).
