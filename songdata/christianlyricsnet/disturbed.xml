		<segment1>Lies birthed kill innocence. Childs smile turn upside-down. Silence bears the mark you see, bring an end to what's to come. You don't see what I can see, twisted pictures haunting me, Failure trails so close behind, you'll just wait till we meet again. You, You're the reason. You're the one that's stealing my freedom. Anger scars another back, Child quiet to mask the pain, Running from a scary man, bring an end to what's to come. You don't see what I can see, twisted pictures haunting me, Failure trails so close behind, you'll just wait till we meet again. Refresh me, renew me, refresh me, renew me    </segment1>
