		<segment1>Her pain is a fog that he inhales. Puts down the phone, neck suddenly stale. It's just another night with a sad different song. Heard from somewhere now she sings along. Turn the car-key, back out of the driveway. He sees her face and he closes his eyes. She still believes the lies</segment1>
		<segment2>Pretty pretty eyes with a darker tone. Another hour in front of the mirror now all the scars are shown. They say let's have another toast let's sing another song. She tries but the vine is bitter and the words wrong. She still believes the lies</segment2>
		<segment3>When you see yourself you're seeing red. And it makes you blind. You must be bleeding under your eyelids tonight. You wait for something to break the mold. And all I can do is wipe the blood from your eyes. You must be bleeding under your eyelids</segment3>
		<segment4>One tear in the sink, swallow the next one. Now out of sight but not really gone. I put the key in the door don't want to walk through. Hang on the handle for a second or two. As the door opens I feel your sadness from across the room. And now for your beauty I'm lost for words</segment4>
		<segment5>When you see yourself you're seeing red. And it makes you blind. You must be bleeding under your eyelids tonight. You wait for something to break the mold. And all I can do is wipe the blood from your eyes. You must be bleeding under your eyelids tonight</segment5>
		<segment6>Wait for something to break the mold. Before your eyes grow old and cold. Keep your ears close to the ground. Don't move until you hear a sound.     </segment6>
