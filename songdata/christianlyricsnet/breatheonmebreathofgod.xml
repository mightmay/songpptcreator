		<segment1>Breathe on me, breath of God. Fill me with life anew that I may love what thou dost love and do what thou wouldst do.</segment1>
		<segment2>Breath on me, breath of God until my heart is pure, until my will is one with thine to do and to endure.</segment2>
		<segment3>Breathe on me breathe on me so that I will never die. Breathe on me, breathe on me. Grant me everlasting life, everlasting life. Breathe on me, breath of God, till I am wholly thine, until this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine, until this earthly part of me glows with thy fire divine.     </segment3>
