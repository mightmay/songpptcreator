		<segment1>Just let me say how much I love You. Let me speak of Your mercy and grace. Just let me live in a shadow of Your beauty. Let me see You face to face</segment1>
		<segment2>And the earth will shake as Your Word goes forth. And the heavens will tremble and fall. But let me say how much I love You. Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend</segment2>
		<segment3>Just let me hear Your finest whispers. As You gently call my name. And let me see Your power and Your glory. Let me feel Your spirit's flame</segment3>
		<segment4>Let me find You in the desert. Till this sand is holy ground. And I am found completely surrendered. To You my Lord and Friend</segment4>
		<segment5>So let me say how much I love You. With all my heart I long for You. For I am caught in this passion of knowing. This endless love I've found in You</segment5>
		<segment6>And the depth of grace, the forgiveness found. To be called a child of God. Just makes me say how much I love You. Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend (x2)</segment6>
		<segment7>Just makes me say how much I love You. Oh my Savior, my Lord and Friend     </segment7>
