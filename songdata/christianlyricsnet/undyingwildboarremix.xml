		<segment1>. (Original Version)</segment1>
		<segment2>Ever since the day that I was made Ive been deciding the end. And I was made of wood and stone and wont diminish or bend. So when the heavy hand of death is here to take me away. Ill be the solid grip of time, forever holding my stay. Nobody ever made a force that took a beating like me. I call the earth and every scum to come and try to fight me. Cus when I made the choice to live beyond the dirt that we tread. I felt the curse of mortal limit fall before it was said </segment2>
		<segment3>[Pre-chorus:]. When this season ends </segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus:]. One final heart-break. And blinding lights will guide our way. Free us our blind state. They will call us by our name.     </segment4>
