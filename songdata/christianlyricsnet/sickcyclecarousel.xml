		<segment1>If shame had a face. I think it would kind of look like mine. If it had a home. Would it be my eyes. Would you believe me. If I said I am tired of this. Now here we go now one more time</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I tried to climb your steps. I tried to chase you down. I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground. I tried to earn my way. I tried to change this mind. You better believe I tried to beat this</segment2>
		<segment3>When will this end. It goes on and on. Over and and over and over again. Keep spinning around. I know it won't stop till I step down, From this for good</segment3>
		<segment4>I never thought I'd end up here. I never thought I'd be standing where I am. I guess I kind of thought it would be easier than this. I guess I was wrong. Now one more time</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>When will this end. It goes on and on. Over and and over and over again. Keep spinning around. I know it won't stop till I step down, From this sick cycle carousel</segment6>
		<segment7>This is a sick cycle carousel. This is a sick cycle, yeah (2x)</segment7>
		<segment8>When will this end. It goes on and on. Over and and over and over again. Keep spinning around. I know it won't stop till I step down, From this sick cycle carousel</segment8>
		<segment9>Sick cycle carousel    </segment9>
