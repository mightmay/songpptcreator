		<segment1> There by the water side. I kissed the neighbor girl and made her cry. So I grabbed a rope there hanging from a tree. And swung myself right in</segment1>
		<segment2>Damp in the summer night. I hid behind the tracks of our old train. I held on every breath until it came. And screamed into the sky</segment2>
		<segment3>Life in the Country. Sweet memory. The simple kid far from the city. Is still the best of me</segment3>
		<segment4>Way on down the dusty road. Spinning Red and white is a barber sign. Where old man Junis he would spit and shine. For a nickel to his name</segment4>
		<segment5>Life in the Country. Sweet memory. The simple kid far from the city. Is still the best of me</segment5>
		<segment6>Bright cast the wooden wall. Around the church where Sunday bells would ring. The second pew is where I learned to sing. Jesus loves me still</segment6>
		<segment7>Life in the Country. Sweet memory. The simple kid far from the city. Is still the best of me    </segment7>
