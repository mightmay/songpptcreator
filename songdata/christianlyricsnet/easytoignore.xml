		<segment1>You and the moon are a beautiful sight to me. The stars in your eyes make it really hard to see you. A night in the sun is all I really want. You and me with the best of both for once.</segment1>
		<segment2>Night breaks. My heart could not ache anymore. Am I that easy to ignore?</segment2>
		<segment3>You let your song blow right through me. Your mighty intellect makes you mighty hard to see. Will there come a time for me to be more to you, more to me?</segment3>
		<segment4>Night breaks. My heart could not ache anymore. Am I that easy to ignore?    </segment4>
