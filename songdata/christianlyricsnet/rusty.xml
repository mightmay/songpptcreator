		<segment1>In this room it's cold and dark. It feels like me. I'm far from home. In this town there is no one. The lamp is low, when can I go home?. All I can do is hold on to what I have. Why did it change?. I liked it how it was. I'm without you, the world spins without me. Without your smile, it takes a while. Nothing has changed, I wish you were here with me. I can't wait until the next time that you'll be here by my side. Is there anything I can do?. Give me a call. I love you. All I can do is hold on to what I have. Why did it change?. I liked it how it was. I'm without you, the world spins without me. Without your smile, it takes a while. I miss you, I wish you were here with me.    </segment1>
