		<segment1>There's a life that I've been aiming for. To please the world I see. And live by taking more. But I'm lost cause, I always come up short. I guess living for yourself will leave you wanting more</segment1>
		<segment2>So here's to new beginnings, and here's to breaking free. Let's chase a new horizon, chase who we're meant to be. (Just) close your eyes and listen, cause Love's calling you and me. To see a new tomorrow, it's who we're meant to be (we're meant to be)</segment2>
		<segment3>Here I am, I can't do this anymore. Keep following the blind, there's a sound I can't ignore. And I know, that I've got a chance to change. But I know the only way, I've got to through the grave</segment3>
		<segment4>We're meant to be. We're meant to be. So we will live</segment4>
		<segment5>I am found, and there's no where left to hide. Love's found me where I am and the change I can't deny. Love is here, I'm not letting go this time. My second birth grace, through death I am alive    </segment5>
