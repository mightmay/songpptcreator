		<segment1>Too many hearts. On too many strings. We could cut them down. But instead we let them hang in the breeze. Oh my brother tell me why</segment1>
		<segment2>And why is my sister down on her knees. Crying out won't somebody help me. And where are we</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). Didn't He love them. Didn't He hold out His hand. Wasn't Jesus a model. An example to man. Of how we must love everyone in this land. And give till it hurts. Isn't that part of the plan</segment3>
		<segment4>But we can't see through our religious charade. To take what He's given. And give love away</segment4>
		<segment5>One more night. No place to call home. A torn-up jacket on his back. It's getting pretty cold. Where do I stand. Do I reach out my hand</segment5>
		<segment6>And one more child's face. An my TV screen. She's dying of hunger. Shy can't we meet her need. And where are we</segment6>
		<segment7>(chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>But we can't see through our holy facade. To do the one thing that we're called to by God</segment8>
		<segment9>Didn't He love us. Didn't He hold out His hand. Wasn't Jesus a model. An example to man. He said love every person. Everyone in this land. To give till it hurts. Wasn't that part of the plan. But we've all been blinded. By our selfish ways. Can we change this pattern. Will we stay the same</segment9>
		<segment10>(chorus 2x)</segment10>
		<segment11>Didn't He love them    </segment11>
