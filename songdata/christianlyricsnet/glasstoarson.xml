		<segment1>Tonight my heart is cold. lost in your lies, shallow replies </segment1>
		<segment2>And gravity prevails this time its over. And you think you're the one </segment2>
		<segment3>Calm me with your lies your simple tragedy. It's all I wish to hear tonight. and your all I wish to be. And this is how we all fall </segment3>
		<segment4>Tonight my heart is cold. Lost in your lies, shallow replies. Tonight I'll just let go. Lost in you eyes, transparent cries </segment4>
		<segment5>And innoncence derailed. Savage the poison. Unhurried compass east </segment5>
		<segment6>Calm me with your lies your simple tragedy. It's all I wish to hear tonight. and your all I wish to be. And this is how we all fall </segment6>
		<segment7>And we are, we are, we are the arsons. who start all of your fires </segment7>
		<segment8>And we are the arsons. who start all of your fires, burning. Burning your city down     </segment8>
