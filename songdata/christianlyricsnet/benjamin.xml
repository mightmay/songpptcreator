		<segment1>Rain falls outside. I think the sky must know what's happening tonight. Children born while fathers die. It's that circle of life that we all live in time</segment1>
		<segment2>We've been friends for a long, long time. So if you can't talk, just cry. And know that we will talk on the other side</segment2>
		<segment3>It's bitter cold outside, but the sun still shines, cause we can feel it. Benjamin, you mark the life that was left behind. We see him in our eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>And we will be friends for a long, long time. So until you can talk, just cry. And know that we will talk for the rest of our lives</segment4>
		<segment5>And He gives, and He takes. And it makes us strong. When He gives, He takes. And it makes us strong</segment5>
		<segment6>Just know that we will be friends for the rest of our lives.     </segment6>
