		<segment1>Have you ever been haunted the way I've been by you. And have you ever felt the measure of the days that I've spent waiting, pining for you. </segment1>
		<segment2>I can't see the sun for the daylight. I can't feel your breath for the wind. I don't wanna step from these shadows, till you're comin back again. </segment2>
		<segment3>I've dammed the emotions to keep my lanterns lit. I'm shaken by this longing that courses through my veins. In my mind I can't make sense of it. </segment3>
		<segment4>I can't see the sun for the daylight. I can't feel your breath for the wind. I get so used to these shadows. Are you comin back again? </segment4>
		<segment5>Do we give up this search and turn out the light?. And give up this holy ghost that rattles through the night? </segment5>
		<segment6>I can't see the sun for the daylight. I can't feel your breath for the wind. I don't wanna step from these shadows, till you're comin back again. </segment6>
		<segment7>I can't see the sun for the daylight. I can't feel your breath for the wind. I get so used to these shadows. Will you chase away these shadows, when you come back again? </segment7>
		<segment8>When you come back again? (7x)    </segment8>
