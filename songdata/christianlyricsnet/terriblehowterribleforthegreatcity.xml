		<segment1>am I a monster when I sink my teeth into her. when I don't love her. no, I don't love you. forgive me darling, but love has nothing to do with this. it has nothing to do with how I can't stop. until I get what I want from you</segment1>
		<segment2>this is what real men keep quiet. it doesn't exist if you can hide it behind your teeth. and sleep at night next to your wife. who you love too much to tell her. you don't love her at all</segment2>
		<segment3>I just feel as empty as the lungs. of those waiting in the womb. do you feel as empty as the lungs of those waiting. to come into this world. where being beautiful means being used</segment3>
		<segment4>how long will we blame the devils on our shoulders. and pose like angels on the outside. when all I am is a monster    </segment4>
