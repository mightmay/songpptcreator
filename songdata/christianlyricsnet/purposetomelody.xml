		<segment1>I remember days gone by and what it was first like. To never think that it could end. Don't know what we were thinking. And I reflect upon that night. When we would breathe for the first time. To see the hands raised high to the One we'd give our lives</segment1>
		<segment2>To this day, I wouldn't change a single thing. Except mistakes that separate. To feel again the reason in. What we give the part the role in which we live</segment2>
		<segment3>I feel like something busting. Breaking out of its own skin. I feel this child escaping outside of the heart of an old man. I feel like something ripping and tearing off this callous. Revealing me. I never want it to end. This old feeling we're feeling again</segment3>
		<segment4>Through seasons of it all, there were deserts that would fall. And there were peaks that we would climb. But in the valley's where we shined. We couldn't dream a better dream. The almighty call our name and do something with nothing. And I give purpose to this melody.     </segment4>
