		<segment1>I'd rather take a shot in the chest than take a shot in the back. At least I'll see it coming, and I'll know where I'm standing at. To get shot down by your own is such a crying shame. So watch your back no matter what side you take</segment1>
		<segment2>You got me caught in a crossfire</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm caught in a crossfire, feels like a suicide. The heat's closing in on me. When it's down to the wire, your life on the line. Will You save me from this chaos surrounding me?</segment3>
		<segment4>You call yourself a soldier, but you've never put your toe to the line. Cause when the banner flies, you're too afraid to ride. You hang me out to dry, you never rendezvous. Eyes in the back of my head, they'll be watching you</segment4>
		<segment5>I would take death before I deny You. I would cheat death just to stand by You. I would fear death if I couldn't see You. I would take death before I deny You. Death before deny.     </segment5>
