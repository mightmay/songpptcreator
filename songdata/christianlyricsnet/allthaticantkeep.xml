		<segment1>All my thoughts start to gain speed, at several thousand feet. Of all the things I see. Of what my life even means. I've gathered all the things, things that I can't keep. </segment1>
		<segment2>Well, I want to give. this world motion that. could carry on when I'm gone. I want to see, I want to love. (I want to believe.). I want to stand up strong. when fire comes. And I want to be the man. I'm meant to be and give away. all that I can't keep. </segment2>
		<segment3>When it rains late in the spring, the pavement and the rain, something moves in me. And it won't leave me alone, to what I'm living for. To what I'm living for. </segment3>
		<segment4>Well, I want to give. this world motion that. could carry on when I'm gone. I want to see, I want to love. I want to believe. I want to stand up strong. when fire comes. And I want to be the man. I'm meant to be, and run when I can't see, and give away all that I can't keep.</segment4>
		<segment5>All the waves inside of me. are moving me to face the day. and give away what I can't keep. All these things that I can't keep.</segment5>
		<segment6>I want to see, I want to bleed. I want to love and find a way. Believe the things that moved in me, I still believe.</segment6>
		<segment7>What moved in me. I still believe. What moved in me, I'll find a way.    </segment7>
