		<segment1>(Verse 1). Brilliant bright, our salvation. Took the fall to hold us up. All the weight of our condition. Lifted away from us</segment1>
		<segment2>Blessed love, falling under. Sacredness taking hold. Split the air, the sound of thunder. Heaven begins to unfold</segment2>
		<segment3>(Pre-Chorus). And the nearness of there. Feels more near to here</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus 1). We can feel the breath of the angels. See the walls bend and shake. The skies in a tremble. Let the day wait</segment4>
		<segment5>To sing the songs of the heavens. See the dawn starts to break. The bonds start to loose so. Feel the earth shake</segment5>
		<segment6>(Verse 2). Darkest night brought redemption</segment6>
		<segment7>Inner sense, divine embrace. In the light of all creation. Heaven and earth start to twist</segment7>
		<segment8>(Pre-Chorus). And the nearness of there. Feels more near to here</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus 2). We can feel the breath of the angels. See the walls bend and shake. The skies in a tremble. Feel the ground break</segment9>
		<segment10>We hear the songs of the heavens. See the world come awake. The bonds start to loose so. Feel the earth shake</segment10>
		<segment11>(Bridge). Blood of a Savior. Pushed back the fall. Love of a Healer. Have overcome</segment11>
