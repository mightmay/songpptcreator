		<segment1>When you see the stars. Shooting 'cross the sky. Do you make a wish. Before it leaves your eyes?. Starlight, starbright. Is it tonight. That I make my flight? </segment1>
		<segment2>When you see the clouds. Shining bright and clear. Then you know the King. Of love is drawing near. Starlight, starbright. Is it tonight. That I make my flight? </segment2>
		<segment3>Am I gonna fly away. Through the clouds today. See the One that I love. Face to face. 'Cause I know that You. You know that I love You. More and more and more everyday </segment3>
		<segment4>But this time, this'll be the last time. That you're gonna see Him. Coming in the clouds. 'Cause the Cornerstone is coming. Come to build His house. Are you ready to go? </segment4>
		<segment5>(repeat)     </segment5>
