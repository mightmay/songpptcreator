		<segment1>I will dance. I will sing. To be mad. For my King. Nothing Lord. Is hindering. This passion in my soul</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: And I'll become. Even more undignified than this. Some may say. It's foolishness. But I'll become. Even more undignified than this. Leave my pride. By my side. And I'll become. Even more undignified than this. Some may say. It's foolishness. But I'll become. Even more undignified than this. Than this</segment2>
		<segment3>La, la, la, la, la, HEY!. La, la, la, la, la. La, la, la, la, la, HEY!. La, la, la, la, la</segment3>
		<segment4>It's all for You my Lord!    </segment4>
