		<segment1>We were walking downtown, my favorite part of town. Through the night we were waiting for a sign, maybe rendered in the darkened sky. Drawn by imaginary lines connecting radiant points of light. You showed up with your hair down and I might not sleep tonight. Lift your gaze from the pavement, from the streets that we've crossed a thousand times before. Dry your eyes there are birds singing on lampposts. they don't know what all your crying is for. I'm sure that I've never seen Christmas-lights this bright before.     </segment1>
