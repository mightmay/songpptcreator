		<segment1>The romance lives on inside. Here I am again. Put this ring around your finger. Can you trust me?. I've hurt so many. I am real this time. I've said I love you. Will you trust me?. Deceived and broken. so many hearts. I'm scared of failing. Failing you, my dear. I know I'm weak. I know I'm broken. You're beauty is in my heart. You're beauty keeps me walking on. I will hold you forever my love. This promise is real. Deceived and broken. So many hearts. It's in the past now. This love is real. I know I've said it before but this time it's real. Forget the past, it's gone. Believe me when I say that you're the one. That you're the one now. Forget the past, it's gone </segment1>
