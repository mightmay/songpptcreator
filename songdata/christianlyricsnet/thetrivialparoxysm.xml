		<segment1>So it begins. And I am surrounded by my enemies. Darkness seems like my closest friend. Suffering and waiting for you. Each breath feels like my last. But that won't stop me. I've seen the way it finds. I won't give up. Carry on til then. And though I'm incapable of sustaining myself even for a moment. I will outlive time. Carry on    </segment1>
