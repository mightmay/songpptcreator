		<segment1>In all that I have found. Your evidence abounds. I've always sensed Your fingerprints. If I just look around</segment1>
		<segment2>And yet this grand display. Will all soon pass away. So I hold on to the mighty truth. That Your love is here to stay</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. The love of the Lord endures. The love of the Lord endures. If there's one thing I can be sure. It's that the love of the Lord endures</segment3>
		<segment4>Life has let me down. In wealth, joy can't be found. I've searched for peace in all of these. But I have always found</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>When I stumble. When I fall. When I'm walking ten feet tall. Your love is there day after day. Even at the worst extreme. Or after I have been redeemed. Your love is there. And it won't let me go</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>Forever, forever    </segment8>
