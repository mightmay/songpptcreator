		<segment1>Is anyone awake? Anyone at all?. Siren song is calling me, it's getting louder now. Compromise is here, I know it's all a lie. I need to hear the melody of Your tune </segment1>
		<segment2>So take me home but keep me feeling lonely. when everyone is around. You're trying to show me how to hear Your song. down here by the water. Far away from the lights I see that I can't live two lives </segment2>
		<segment3>Everywhere I go I carry with me. this ceiling that divides us - it's coming in between. When conversation turns into a monologue. I need to just be silent here and listen for Your tune </segment3>
		<segment4>Night time lends its ear to the sound of my disappointment. When the ideal fades I don't want to complain. I just want to hear You sing.    </segment4>
