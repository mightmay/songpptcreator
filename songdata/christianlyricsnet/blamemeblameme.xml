		<segment1>And we could ride all night. To the place of a blinking light. Wishing traffic was faster. Traffic was faster. Keeping safe distance. But courting disaster. We could dance all night. To the sounds of a starting fight. Hoping change would come around. Change would come around. Amazing division. How sweet the sound </segment1>
		<segment2>Blame Me! Blame Me! Blame Me!. For mistakes you've made. But you can't own. Hate Me! Hate Me! Hate Me!. For every honest word. That you postpone. Leave me out of this. Lights on sinking ships. Are gleaming! gleaming! gleaming!. For mistakes you've made. But you can't own </segment2>
		<segment3>And we could stare all day. At problems that will go away. Silence is pounding. Silence is pounding. You're wearing me down. These corners, they're rounding. We could scream all night. You know there's love still left inside. Stop saying you're sorry. All of these words feel so very empty </segment3>
		<segment4>Blame Me! Blame Me! Blame Me!. For mistakes you've made. But you can't own. Hate Me! Hate Me! Hate Me!. For every honest word. That you postpone. Lights on sinking ships. Are gleaming! gleaming! gleaming!. For mistakes you've made. But you can't own </segment4>
		<segment5>Torturing ourselves. We must be into the abuse. If you're the rope that ties us together. Then please make me a new sad speech. Or leave and beg me just to stay. Used to run to my arms. But now I'm pulling away. Come and go as you please. I'm like a part time lover. With well worn knees. Well come on.     </segment5>
