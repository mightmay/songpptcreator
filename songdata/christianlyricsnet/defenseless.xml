		<segment1>I need to look confident so I don't feel ashamed. I put a strong face on so they won't see my mistakes. I work to earn their praise as I go about my day. I need them to need me. So I feel I have a place</segment1>
		<segment2>Here I am defenseless. Abba, Father I have nothing left. Only in my weakness will I find you. Find You. Only in my weakness</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't want to wait on You. I'm afraid You'll never show. Lord, I know you love me. But I still feel so alone. I'll do anything to turn my thoughts off. To hush this silence. I don't want to be reminded of my loneliness</segment3>
		<segment4>Here I am defenseless. Abba, Father I have nothing left. Only in my weakness will I find you. Find You. Only in my weakness</segment4>
		<segment5>Find You. Find You</segment5>
		<segment6>Here I am defenseless. Abba, Father I have nothing left. Only in my weakness will I find you. Find You. Only in my weakness</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm laying down. I'm letting go. I'm laying down. I'm letting go    </segment7>
