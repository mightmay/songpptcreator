		<segment1>Pour out your water. That I might take a sip. Your love consumes me. Every drip. It is like Honey. On my lips. Pour out your water. That I might take a sip</segment1>
		<segment2>Your words. are a lamp unto my feet. when I walk down these. Dark and Lonely streets. You are all I need</segment2>
		<segment3>Pour out your mercy. and clear this busy mind. your love is like eden. a slice of apple pie. It is like sugar on my toung. So pour out your mercy. clear my busy mind</segment3>
		<segment4>Your words. are a lamp unto my feet. when I walk down these. Dark and Lonely streets. You are all I need     </segment4>
