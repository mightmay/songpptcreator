		<segment1>Verse 1: The Lord of Host. He's Strong and Mighty in Battle. He's in control, there's nothing. He can't handle. Just as His presence alone, everything no like Him got to move. For He is Holy, exalted and He's worthy. Great is the Lord and His glory is far above the Heavens. I fear and tremble for the Lord is terrible and all powerful. The wicked melt, (like wax) the darkness fades away. For the Lord is Great and He's worthy to be praised</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: All Hail the King of Glory. All Hail the King of Glory. All Hail the King of Glory. All Hail the King. All Hail the King of Glory. All Hail the King of Glory. All Hail the King, the King of Glory</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: No one is greater, greater than the King. He's Alpha &amp; Omega and everything between. A very present help in the time of trouble. He's my refuge and my fortress I will trust Him. Now let all His people, in all the earth, respect His presence. Give Him praise and give Him worship. The King is here and He reigns in majesty. He gets all the glory for He alone is worthy</segment3>
		<segment4>All Hail the King of Glory. All Hail the King of Glory. All Hail the King of Glory. Holy, Holy, All Hail.. the King of Glory. Worthy, Worthy, All Hail.. The King of Glory. Worthy, Worthy, All Hail.. The King of Glory. Jesus, Jesus, All hail.. the King of Glory. Jesus, Jesus, All hail.. the King of Glory. Halle-lujah All Hail.. the King of Glory. Halle-lujah All Hail.. the King of Glory. The King of Glory (repeat_. All Hail the King of Glory</segment4>
