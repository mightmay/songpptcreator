		<segment1>How I love these roads. Every far and lonely highway, Through basin and range. And a desert that never ends-. A sky so wide. You can feel your heart turn quiet, And then I listen. For the voices of my friends </segment1>
		<segment2>One rides in the summer wind beside me, One flies with the stars. That set the wild night on fire, One runs close and steady as a river, I could drive for miles. Carried by that choir. </segment2>
		<segment3>From the hills of my hometown, To the Arizona canyons, From Chinle to Sky City. To the gorge of the Rio Grande-. The high and winding way. From Chimayo to Las Trampas, The long road bends. To the sweet sound of my friends. </segment3>
		<segment4>One's up where the clouds brush the mountains, One rushes down a stream. Past the bright columbine -. I could drive for miles. Just thinking about them, How I love the road. And these true friends of mine. </segment4>
		<segment5>One rides in the summer wind beside me, One flies with the stars. That set the wild night on fire, One runs close and steady as a river. I could drive for miles. Carried by that choir.    </segment5>
