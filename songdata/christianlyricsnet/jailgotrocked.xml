		<segment1>Warden threw Paul and Silas down in jail. The prisoners around 'em thought their plans had failed. It started somethin' when the boys began to sing. It shook the earth a lot and let the jailbirds spring. In the stocks -- everybody was shocked. Every door in each cell was unlocked. When the Macedonian jail got rocked. Silas started praisin' and it cracked some stone. Little do they know it was a sign of what's to come. A rumblin' noise it hit the boys and smashed those chains. It broke the Richter scale -- it was a powerful thing. CHORUS. From the throne of Heaven came a thundering. Tore right through the jail rather effortlessly. They should've used a seismograph but honestly. They wanted to but it was 51 AD. CHORUS. Macedonia prison in the time of Rome. Was more like California when it all was done. The warden said, &quot;Hey buddy, could you please explain?. Can you tell me what to do so I'll get saved? Lets talk!&quot;. CHORUS. &quot;If you just believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Warden, you can now repent and change your life. Would you like forgiveness?&quot; And he said, &quot;Yes, yes!. &quot;You gotta stick around, I'm gonna get my kids! Lets talk!&quot;. CHORUS.     </segment1>
