		<segment1>And noe I sit in thought as the plot of my days commences, and I'm left with fences. Put off the thoughts of my end so long to race. to chase after the trend so fleeting. Hours pass unsettled, unresolved my passions. I scrape to win a new day to waste. Misaligned priorities parallel my desires. I hide my eyes to avoid embrace. I smell the stench, unavoidable approach comes against. And yet I'm left asking the question. Denied a way to defend the thoughts. That this side equates with what awaits</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm ripping right through the masses, sacrifice into ashes. Giving up what was past tense, raising up like Lazarus. I laugh at the strongman who thought he had control. A hold on my eternity-eternal is Christ empowers me. Like the faith that builds my strength. Is like your dreams that fade away. The battlefiels we soldiers play. I dance with life beyond the grave. And Jah knows that I will never rest my head. No time for us to sleep. We concentrate on the son until our eyes bleed. Salvation carries a cost, we must prevail. Death creeps like the breeze, but have no fear, watch me inhale</segment2>
		<segment3>Temporary bliss, the depths await my burial as the hours seem as seconds. The end of your bliss is coming --face the path and sip the last. Embrace ends-every day a new day to die. Diestime-the former life is past. Blindside-I know what awaits my fate. Hastebreath-unavoidable ceasing of days. Today is a good day to die.     </segment3>
