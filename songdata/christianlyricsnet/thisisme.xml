		<segment1>Everyday I wake up late. Since I quit my day job I have been sane. But responsiblilites sure do remain, but i'll just let them wait.</segment1>
		<segment2>Because I don't know what I am doing now, and I wont try to act like it cuz i sure dont know how. And i'll admit that I don't know, just where i'm going on this long and winding road. that's taking me to what till be my home.</segment2>
		<segment3>So stare and see that this is me, and I will be just what I need to believe. that something is what i'm gonna be. And what you do is what you do and what I do needs to be true. The things I do maybe need to be thought through, but just remember what's right forme, might be not right for you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Staring at this mirror and I'm wondering who you are. Right now is a time for searching and I just wish i had a car. to drive a long distance and just think about the war, and now life's got so much more.</segment4>
		<segment5>Because I don't know what i am doing now, and I wont try to act like it cuz i sure dont know how. And i'll admit that I don't know, just where i'm going on this long and winding road. that's taking me to what till be my home.</segment5>
		<segment6>So stare and see that this is me, and I will be just what I need to believe. that something is what I'm gonna be. And what you do is what you do, and what I do needs to be true. The things i do maybe need to be thought through.. But I know what I want to dok and I want it to be true. And yeah I'd be the first to say that of cource i'll listen to you, but remember what's right for me, might be not right for you    </segment6>
