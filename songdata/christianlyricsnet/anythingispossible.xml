		<segment1>Anything is possible. In Him all things are possible. All you do is keep the faith. don't give up 'cause it's never too late</segment1>
		<segment2>Anything is possible. In Him all things are possible. You can have whatever you say. Cast your fears away</segment2>
		<segment3>There is a way. That you can have everything. that you've always dreamed of. There is a way. Just keep your feet on the ground. while you reach for the heavens. There is a way. It may take a little time. but never stray from the vision. Just keep the faith. You can't give up now</segment3>
		<segment4>repeat chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>There is a way. It may be hard for you now, but it's gonna get better. Your life will change. I've seen it done in the past, so never say never. Where is your faith. You can speak to the mountain. and it will be moved. That is the way. To receive all He has for you</segment5>
