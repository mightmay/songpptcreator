		<segment1>Looking back what can I say?. There's been things done the wrong way. I have tried. Sometimes it's hard. All the time I've wasted didn't get me far. I try to live my life right, but it seems so hard. Why have I not used your help?. Now I see your sacrifice for me. Now I know your watching over me. Now I know I'll never be alone. I hope you're not ashamed of me. I haven't been the best. I hope I'm not the worst. Help me live my life for you. I can't do it on my own. I need your help. If you're not tired of me, I really need your help. Now I see your sacrifice for me. Now I know your watching over me. Now I see the greatness of your love. Now I know I'll never be alone. I'm tired of wasting all this time. Help me live my life. I can't do it all alone. Please stay by my side.     </segment1>
