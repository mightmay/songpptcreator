		<segment4>though your sins were as scarlet. they will be as white as snow. though they were red, red as crimson. they will be like wool. when everything is beautiful</segment4>
		<segment5>verse 2:</segment5>
		<segment6>. everything i tried to hide, all the game I've been playing. every secret every lie, all the shame I've been claiming. come and whisper in my ear, say the words i long to hear</segment6>
		<segment7>chorus:</segment7>
