		<segment1>You're the least of my problems, I won't give you the time. You're the least of my worries you're not worth your weight. I'll bet everything I have that you'll be there. To have what you call fun - but I don't care. Small town! small minds!. This means you!. Small town! small minds!. You don't have a clue    </segment1>
