		<segment1>Everybody falls sometimes. Gotta find the strength to rise. From the ashes and make a new beginning. Anyone can feel the ache. You think its more than you can take. But you are stronger, stronger than you know. Dont you give up now. The sun will soon be shining. You gotta face the clouds. To find the silver lining</segment1>
		<segment2>Ive seen dreams that move the mountains. Hope that doesnt ever end. Even when the sky is falling. And Ive seen miracles just happen. Silent prayers get answered. Broken hearts become brand new. Thats what faith can do</segment2>
		<segment3>It doesnt matter what youve heard. Impossible is not a word. Its just a reason for someone not to try. Everybodys scared to death. When they decide to take that step. Out on the water. Itll be alright. Life is so much more. Than just what your eyes are seeing. You will find your way. If you keep believing</segment3>
		<segment4>Ive seen dreams that move the mountains. Hope that doesnt ever end. Even when the sky is falling. And Ive seen miracles just happen. Silent prayers get answered. Broken hearts become brand new. Thats what faith can do</segment4>
		<segment5>Overcome the odds. You do have a chance. (Thats what faith can do). When the world says you cant. Itll tell you that you can!</segment5>
		<segment6>Ive seen dreams that move the mountains. Hope that doesnt ever end. Even when the sky is falling. And Ive seen miracles just happen. Silent prayers get answered. Broken hearts become brand new. Thats what faith can do. Even if you fall sometimes. You will have the strength to rise    </segment6>
