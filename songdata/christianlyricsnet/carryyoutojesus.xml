		<segment1>I will not pretend to feel the pain youre going through. I know I cannot comprehend the hurt youve known. And I used to think it mattered if I understood. But now I just dont know</segment1>
		<segment2>Well, Ill admit sometimes I still wish I knew what to say. And I keep looking for a way to fix it all. But we know were at the mercy of Gods higher ways. And our ways are so small</segment2>
		<segment3>But I will carry you to Jesus. He is everything you need. I will carry you to Jesus on my knees</segment3>
		<segment4>Its such a privilege for me to give this gift to you. All Id ever hope youd give me in return. Is to know that youll be there to do the same for me. When the tables turn</segment4>
		<segment5>And if you need to cry go on and I, I will cry along with you, yeah. Ive given you what I have but still I know the best thing I can do. Is just pray for you</segment5>
		<segment6>Ill carry you. Ill take you to Jesus on my knees     </segment6>
