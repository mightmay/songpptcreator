		<segment1>Another case of I wish I wouldnt have. Another promise not to let Him down again. Fighting battles in a war I thought was over. The old man of sin died a long time ago. But left behind a sinful nature deep within. So if I want to win this fight. Theres a part of me that must die. But Im not gonna cry</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause Im dying to live. Live for Jesus. Dying to give myself to Him. And the life that He gives will be mine. If I am dying to live. Dying to live. Live for Jesus. I want to give myself to him. Gonna give up from now on Im dying to live</segment2>
		<segment3>Giving up what I cant keep anyway. To gain something that I know Ill never lose. Trading in the temporary for the eternal. And though its settled Im reminded everyday. To live or die to self its up to me to choose. So if I want to win the fight theres a part of me. That must die. Well Ive said my goodbyes</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause Im dying to live. Live for Jesus. Dying to give myself to Him. And the life that He gives will be mine. If I am dying to live. Dying to live. Live for Jesus. I want to give myself to him. Gonna give up from now on Im dying to live </segment4>
