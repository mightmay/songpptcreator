		<segment1>I never said I'd prove it, I only said I'd show it. I gave you my all, but you wanted more. Lost on the inside, filling up the score.</segment1>
		<segment2>I remember playing that one. It's stuck in my head. Over and Over. I took and you bled.</segment2>
		<segment3>I never said I'd prove it, I only said I'd show it. I gave you my all, but you wanted more. Lost on the inside, filling up the score.</segment3>
		<segment4>I am impatient. Misunderstood. What ever it is, I've got what it cured. To your arms I run. My own life, it crumbles. No longer am I damned. No longer do I stumble.</segment4>
		<segment5>I remember playing that one. It's stuck in my head. Over and Over. I took and you bled.    </segment5>
