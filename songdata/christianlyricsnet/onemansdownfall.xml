		<segment1>walking down that road you feel times weight it's too hard to look straight you simply want what you cannot have but in the present all you see is what man has longed in history the road is long slow is the progress i can't help but realize you're full of lame excuses but how many times have they worked buying you time when your time is rendered useless you're all maxed out the well's sucked dry true colors coming out in the test of time look ahead there's another turnoff one man's downfall another's glory check your mirrors cause they tell the story one man's downfall another's glory when you made that mistake a lifetime paying for a turnoff taken and again the choice is yours.     </segment1>
