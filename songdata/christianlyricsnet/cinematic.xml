		<segment1>The other night I had a dream. It unfolded to the silver screen. A tragic fire, some tears were shed. I woke to find our hero dead. And wonder, What if this was me?</segment1>
		<segment2>If my life was cinematic. With a soundtrack so dramatic. Youd be the hero and You would save me. And it would have the sweetest ending</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to live in such a way. That when Im gone my friends would say. That if my life was turned to film. Id be standing on a mountain shouting victory in the end. But in my heart I know its only true. If Im supporting actor and the Oscar goes to You</segment3>
		<segment4>If my life was cinematic. With a soundtrack so dramatic. Youd be the hero and You would save me. And it would have the sweetest ending</segment4>
		<segment5>I dont want to let You down. I want to make you proud. If anyone is watching me. I want to make it count for something</segment5>
		<segment6>What if it ended here?. What if the credits rolled now?. What would the critics say?. Would it be the biggest let down?</segment6>
		<segment7>If my life was cinematic. With a soundtrack so dramatic. Youd be the hero and You would save me. And it would have the sweetest ending    </segment7>
