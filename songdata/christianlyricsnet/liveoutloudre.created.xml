Imagine thisI get a phone call from Regis. He says, &quot;Do you want to be a millionaire?&quot;. They put me on the show and I win with two lifelines to spare. Now picture thisI act like nothing ever happened. And bury all the money in a coffee can. Well, Ive been given more than Regis ever gave away. I was a dead man who was called to come out of my grave. And I think its time for makin some noise</segment1>
		<segment2>Wake the neighbors, get the word out. Come oncrank up the musicclimb a mountain and shout. This is life weve been given made to be lived out. So la la la la live out loud. Live out loud, yeah</segment2>
		<segment3>Think about thistry to keep a bird from singing. After its soared up in the sky. Give the sun a cloudless day and tell it not to shine. Now think about thisif we really have been given. The gift of a life that will never end. And if we have been filled with living hope were gonna overflow. And if Gods love is burning in our hearts were gonna glow. Theres just no way to keep it in</segment3>
		<segment4>Everybody, come on. La la lala la la la. La la la live out loud. I want to hear everybody sing. La la lala la la la. La la la live out loud, loud, loud</segment4>
		<segment5>Every corner of creation is a living declaration. Come join the song we were made to sing
