		<segment1>Praise to the father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Our God and our King to Him we will sing. In His great mercy He has given us life. Now we can be called the children of God. Great is the love that the Father has given us. He has delivered us, He has delivered us</segment1>
		<segment2>Children of God sing your song and rejoice. For the love that He has given us all, children of God. By the blood of His son we have been redeemed and we can be called. Children of God, Children of God. A mystery is revealed to the universe. The Father above has proved His love. Now we are free from the judgment that we deserve. And so we are called the children of God. We are the saints, we are the children. Weve been redeemed, weve been forgiven. We are the sons and the daughters of our God    </segment2>
