		<segment1>So this is how it goes. Well I, I would have never known. And if it ends today. Well I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I think we're taking this too far. Don't you know that it's not this hard?. Well it's not this hard. But if you take what's yours and I take mine. Must we go there?. Please not this time. No, not this time.</segment2>
		<segment3>Well this is not your fault. But if I'm without you. Then I will feel so small. And if you have to go. Well always know that you shine brighter than anyone does.</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I think we're taking this too far. Don't you know that it's not this hard?. Well it's not this hard. But if you take what's yours and I take mine. Must we go there?. Please not this time. No, not this time.</segment4>
		<segment5>If you run away now, Will you come back around?. And if you ran away, I'd still wave goodbye. Watching you shine bright.</segment5>
		<segment6>Now I think we're taking this too far. Don't you know that it's not this hard?. Well it's not this hard. But if you take what's yours and I take mine. Must we go there?. Please not this time. No, not this time.</segment6>
		<segment7>I'll wave goodbye (You shine bright). Watching you shine bright (You shine bright). I'll wave goodbye tonight (You shine bright)    </segment7>
