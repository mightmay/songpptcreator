		<segment1>Taken up out of the world. Shaken up with just a word. Turned around so suddenly. I'm alive eternally. Something invisible. Has become so beautiful. I know I am born again. Laughing and stumbling</segment1>
		<segment2>Draw me after You - let me run with You. Show me all Your. Kingdom come</segment2>
		<segment3>My heart is where my treasure lies. My great reward is in Your eyes. My every breath belongs to You. You are my treasure</segment3>
		<segment4>Take the world up out of me. Put the fruit back on the tree. I give everything to be. What only You want me to be. The treasure that You've become. Is shining brighter than the sun. Feels like I am born again. Stumbling    </segment4>
