		<segment1>picked up the paper and read the news (can you believe what is happening). people hopeless and begging for food (and the whole world's just standin' still). I want to practice what I preach (to put love into action). right now the world within our reach (right here's where we start to run)</segment1>
		<segment2>do you feel what I feel?. I dare you to come..</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). we're goin' worldwide. to every creature that's breathin'. we're goin' worldwide. 'til this story is heard. we're goin' worldwide. and no one can stop us. we're goin' worldwide. to the ends of the earth</segment3>
		<segment4>tonight the walls are tumblin' down (tonight there's no time for sleepin'). I will not rest 'til the trumpet sounds (I will not falter - I will run)</segment4>
		<segment5>do you feel what I feel? (do you feel what I feel?). I dare you to come..</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)    </segment6>
