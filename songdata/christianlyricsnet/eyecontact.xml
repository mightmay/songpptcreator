		<segment1>I still see you washing your hands. Things aren't like that. Trust me, understand. The blood will make you clean. The blood will make you clean. But your eyes are down. Please look at me. But your eyes are down. Please look at me. I still see you washing your hands. Things aren't like that. Trust me, understand. The blood will make you clean. The blood will make you clean. But your eyes are down. Please look at me. But your eyes are down. Please look at me. And every time you walk away the sadness follows.. And every time you walk away the sadness follows..you!. I still see you washing your hands. (Look at me!). Things aren't like that. Trust me, understand. The blood will make you clean. (Look at me!). The blood will make you clean. But your eyes are down. Please look at me. But your eyes are down. Please look at me. I still see you!. The blood..the blood will make you clean.    </segment1>
