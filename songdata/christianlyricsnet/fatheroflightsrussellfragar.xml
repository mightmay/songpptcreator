		<segment1>I'm changed I'm not the same. The Father called me by my name. He called me through His Son. The Father's holy righteous One. We are the first fruits. The children of the King</segment1>
		<segment2>Praise to the Father of lights. In Him there's day there is no night. Every good gift comes from above. A certain sign of the Father's love. He made me in His image. And I'm wonderfully made. He saved me through His only Son. And I'm wonderfully saved    </segment2>
