		<segment1>We pray for blessings. We pray for peace. Comfort for family, protection while we sleep. We pray for healing, for prosperity. We pray for Your mighty hand to ease our suffering. All the while, You hear each spoken need. Yet love us way too much to give us lesser things</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause what if Your blessings come through raindrops. What if Your healing comes through tears. What if a thousand sleepless nights. Are what it takes to know Youre near. What if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise</segment2>
		<segment3>We pray for wisdom. Your voice to hear. And we cry in anger when we cannot feel You near. We doubt Your goodness, we doubt Your love. As if every promise from Your Word is not enough. All the while, You hear each desperate plea. And long that we'd have faith to believe</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause what if Your blessings come through raindrops. What if Your healing comes through tears. What if a thousand sleepless nights. Are what it takes to know Youre near. And what if trials of this life are Your mercies in disguise</segment4>
		<segment5>When friends betray us. When darkness seems to win. We know the pain reminds this heart. That this is not, this is not our home. It's not our home</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause what if Your blessings come through raindrops. What if Your healing comes through tears. And what if a thousand sleepless nights. Are what it takes to know Youre near. What if my greatest disappointments. Or the aching of this life. Is the revealing of a greater thirst this world cant satisfy. And what if trials of this life. The rain, the storms, the hardest nights. Are Your mercies in disguise    </segment6>
