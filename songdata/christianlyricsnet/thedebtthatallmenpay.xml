		<segment1>I see you drowning. Ive come to hold you down.</segment1>
		<segment2>This is the cycle that I will lock you into. Without air youll breathe anything I give to you. So self-absorbed you fail to see yourself. Ive got my hold on you and Im not letting go.</segment2>
		<segment3>Im the puppeteer, and you have lost control. Im the puppeteer, and you have lost control. Oh, marionette, how you move when I tell you to move. Oh, how beautiful the look of conformity wears on you. Hell has met its match.</segment3>
		<segment4>Repent oh wicked one, false encounters dont fool me. Repent oh wicked one, I said coward are you weak. Who is your god now as your burned in this eternal fire, you cant change the damage youve done. And as your burned in this eternal fire, you will take away the lives youve won.</segment4>
		<segment5>So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God. So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God. All out of hope, Im a broken man. Where will I go?. (So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.). All out of hope, Im a broken man. Where will I go?. (So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.). All out of hope, Im a broken man. Where will I go?. (So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.). All out of hope, Im a broken man. Where will I go?. (So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.)</segment5>
		<segment6>As you walk towards the fire, as you make your final choice. Look up to the light, look up to eternal life.     </segment6>
