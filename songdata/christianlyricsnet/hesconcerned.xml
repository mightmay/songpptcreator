		<segment1>God is just a prayer away. All you need to do is call. He will hear your faintest cry. He's concerned about you.</segment1>
		<segment2>So while your tears are flowing through. Your time of mourning. He is here to lift your heavy heart. Because he's in love with you.</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: He knows. He cares. He sees. He's there. He'll carry you. He's concerned about you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Weeping may endure for a night. But the morning will bring joy. He won't give you more than you can bear. He's concerned about you</segment4>
		<segment5>He loves you, oh yes. He loves you, ooh ooh, He loves you. (I know he does, he really does). He's concerned about you.</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: He knows. He cares. He sees. He's there. He'll carry you. He's concerned about you</segment6>
		<segment7>He knows and. He cares. He sees. He's right there. He'll carry you. He's concerned about you. He's concerned about you. He's concerned about you.    </segment7>
