		<segment1>- verse 1 -. How could i fail to understand, You were not a &quot;righteous man?. You were something different. Something more like I AM. But i am so unworthy. So undeserving. Im just so dirty. Still You came down for me. You walked upon this dirty ground for me. You wore thorns on Your brow for me.</segment1>
		<segment2>- chorus -. what am I supposed to say, when i dont understand?. Your way is not my way. You are a God, and i am a man.</segment2>
		<segment3>- verse 2 -. how could my pride make me forget, im not the One who was sent. i am someone different. someone more like a man. but You are, You are so holy, surrounded by glory. Youre just so worthy. but still, i nail You down for me. i throw You on this dirty ground for me. i push thorns on Your brow for me.</segment3>
		<segment4>- chorus -.     </segment4>
