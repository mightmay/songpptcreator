		<segment1>Light of the world. Are you still here?. And are we illuminating?. When love becomes a delicate display. So weak, dissolved by anything </segment1>
		<segment2>Love lies here waiting all alone. Can a king be a king. Weighed down? </segment2>
		<segment3>Our hearts, a bubble maker's dream. Moved on by winds of everything. As we deny that love is still the king. Not as weak as we make him out to be </segment3>
		<segment4>Love lies here waiting all alone. Can a king be a king. Weighed down? </segment4>
		<segment5>Weighed down. Weighed down. Weighed down. Weighed down     </segment5>
