		<segment1>I need a witness, today I become a man. Tonight I will end this. Enduring, inhaling, waiting on this tide to come in. These waves keep tormenting, crashing down on everything I have left. Barely able to withstand the pressure of lifes cascading tests. With passion I pursue. Eager to conquer I still push on. With passion I pursue. Well Im an open book, still pushing on. Im just waiting on that splash of fresh air. Something to ease lifes heavy load. That relinquishing last breath. Just to know that I made it past another day. Just to know that I made it there unscathed</segment1>
		<segment2>An empty barren carcass, armed with a mind. With ambition for victory, I confide. To encourage, invoking all thats inside. (repeat)</segment2>
		<segment3>I prevail over every wicked bitter thing you've said. We, we prevail, mere champions among men</segment3>
		<segment4>Finally I can breathe again. My lungs no longer filled with disbelief. This lighthouse still guiding me home. I can breathe again</segment4>
		<segment5>WE WITHSTOOD, WE DEFEATED, WE HELD OUR GROUND</segment5>
		<segment6>No longer choking on failure's thick heavy scent, WE MOVE ON. Tired but still prepared, eyes ahead, no turning back. I prevail over every wicked bitter thing you've said. We, we prevail, mere champions among men    </segment6>
