		<segment1>
Straight from the ghetto streets of Harlem,. came two brothers Willis and Arnold,. black goldfish swims in the bowl,. he's three feet high, four with the afro.. Stealing cookies from the jar,. droppin' water balloons on cars.. I hope Mrs. Garret won't see,. just play sick for Mohammed Ali.. the Gooch is coming, to steal milk money.</segment1>
		<segment2>Arnold, and Willis, and Mr. Drumond,. and don't forget Kimberly.. They just cancelled Dukes of Hazard,. Different Strokes is all I want to see.</segment2>
		<segment3>Way up high in the penthouse apartment,. making us laugh its Willis and Arnold.. Mr. Drumond's got the dough,. they get to ride in a limo</segment3>
		<segment4>Different Strokes, its almost time.. We just watch 'cause Kimberly's fine.. Half hour long it never fills us, when he says,. &quot;What you talkin' 'bout Willis?&quot;.. Write the cable company,. different strokes all the time.</segment4>
		<segment5>Mr. Drumond, a man of the means,. loves two black brothers,. they've only got the blue jeans.
