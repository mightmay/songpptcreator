		<segment2>You hide your soul. To keep the hurt inside. All alone your tears call out into the night. Is He theredoes He care</segment2>
		<segment3>Yes, I know your name. Ever prayer you pray. Im the one who brought you to this place. The voice who sings to you. The hand that clings to you. Oh my child, Ive always known your name. Known your name</segment3>
		<segment4>I hold you close to me, close to heart. And this kind of love will find you. Anywhere you are. Never fear, I am here    </segment4>
