		<segment1>Find myself with my mic in a tight spot. There the type to pick a fight in the light or dark. Sceneries turn mean they and mimic me. Many men is thieves epidemically. Calling names out whos gonna settle it They use fists ignorant to break our fellowship. Those thugs at the parties never get chicks. Under developed kids dropping out a English. Bunch of idiots living insignificant. Caught in anything theyd kill a king. No worries man be Christness got me off the crutches living righteous. And I might just. Hang with the likes of these common thieves, prostitutes you can say you saw me </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. If Im a live, Im a live for my God. And if Im a die Im a die for the cause. Dont matter got peace in my mind. Day after day, let the love shine.     </segment2>
