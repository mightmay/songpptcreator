		<segment1>Let no one caught in sin remain. Inside the lie of inward shame. But fix our eyes upon the cross. And run to Him who showed great love. And bled for us. Freely You've bled for us</segment1>
		<segment2>Christ is risen from the dead. Trampling over death by death. Come awake, come awake. Come and rise up from the grave. Christ is risen from the dead. We are one with Him again. Come awake, come awake. Come and rise up from the grave</segment2>
		<segment3>Beneath the weight of all our sin. You bowed to none but heaven's will. No scheme of hell, no scoffer's crown. No burden great can hold You down. In strength You reign. Forever let Your church proclaim</segment3>
		<segment4>O death, where is your sting?. O hell, where is your victory?. O church, come stand in the light. The glory of God has defeated the night</segment4>
		<segment5>O death, where is your sting?. O hell, where is your victory?. O church, come stand in the light. Our God is not dead. He's alive! He's alive!    </segment5>
