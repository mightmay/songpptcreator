		<segment1>Getting started with a new song for our friends. Something that can help us we can always make amends. It keeps on getting better than it ever was before. It keeps on getting better Jah keeps opening up doors. This song is for y'all people that are with us to the end. The Father, Son, the Holy Ghost, our family and our friends. We love you and appreciate everything that you've done. I hope you think that it's not over 'cause we've only just begun</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>Reaching out and walking with the ones I love is the only thing I ever wanted to do</segment3>
		<segment4>We're packin' up our bags and we're heading through your town. We're gonna get those speakers pumpin' make sure you get down. We're gonna do it all just like we did it once before. We're gonna keep on going 'cause God's opening up doors. This song is for y'all people that are with us to the end. The Father, Son, the Holy Ghost, our family and our friends. We love you and appreciate everything that you've done. I hope you think that it's not over 'cause we've only just begun</segment4>
		<segment5>I love you for everything you are and what you've given me. I love you for everything you are and what you've given me    </segment5>
