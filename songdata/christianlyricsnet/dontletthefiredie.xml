		<segment1>I can still feel the prayers you prayed for me all those years. And I see now more than ever what a differrence they have made. I can still hear your words spoken from a heart of deep concern. Saying keep your eyes on Jesus and love Him more than anything. I've watched the wind blow hard against you. And I've seen your faith get weakened by the pain. And I want you to know that I'll be praying for you to hold on</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't let the fire die. The flame has been dimmed by the tears that you've cried. But I can still see the spark of His love in your eyes. So don't let the fire don't let the fire die</segment2>
		<segment3>This heavy weight you carry around. Of letting yourself and everybody down. Is pouring water on the passion that used to burn so bright. I know you have your reasons for resentment. And I know it's more than I can understand. So just let me say that I will be praying for you. To let it all go</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't let the fire die. The flame has been dimmed by the tears that you've cried. But I can still see the spark of His love in your eyes. So don't let the fire don't let the fire die</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm not praying for the fire to burn the way it did before. Cause I believe the one who started this flame in your heart. He wants to give you more. So dont let the fire die     </segment5>
