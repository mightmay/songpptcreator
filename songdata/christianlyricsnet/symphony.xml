		<segment1>Im in the mood for a breakdown. A slowing down of all the things in my mind. That keep on trying to figure out how to pin you down</segment1>
		<segment2>In desperate need of a shakedown. A blowing down of all the ways that I try. To talk you into a corner until you look like me</segment2>
		<segment3>But when I finally see what you see. Theres a symphony. I hear a symphony</segment3>
		<segment4>Words cannot define. What it means to be. In your symphony. In your symphony</segment4>
		<segment5>A long awaited let down. A burning through thats calling me back to you. With a beautiful melody of all you love</segment5>
		<segment6>Its welling deep inside of me, Its springing out, the song that Im meant to sing. So teach me the harmony to all you love</segment6>
		<segment7>Hearts in unison. Im drawn into your love. Hearts in unison. I understand your love</segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
