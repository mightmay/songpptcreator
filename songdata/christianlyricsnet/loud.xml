		<segment1>I put it all on the line when I talk to you. Cuz if I keep it underground, it can't get through. I want for you to see the very best in me. My eyes are open wide and now I'm breathing. I've finally broken free the fire burns in me</segment1>
		<segment2>You can try and turn me down. But I was born to be this loud. How can I be quiet now. When I believe it and I want it</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm not gonna wait till I'm out of time. Please forgive me if it seems like I'm out of line. I hope that you believe, I'm not your enemy. I'm not the least bit concerned with my own way. But I cannot ignore the things I'm living for</segment3>
		<segment4>You can try and turn me down. But I was born to be this loud. How can I be quiet now. When I believe it and I want it</segment4>
