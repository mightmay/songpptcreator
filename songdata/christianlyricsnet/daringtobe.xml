		<segment1>I've had enough of the same old. Tired ordinary world. Telling my heart that I'm nothin'. But an ordinary girl. So sick and tired of falling for that lie every time. I've got a desire just to find out if there's more. And it starts tonight </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: I'm waving goodbye to my pretty little life. Taking your hand and crossing that line. Daring to leave the old me. Shout it out loud, I'm not ashamed. Diving in now, and so not afraid. Hello to all that You see. And everything You made me. I'm daring to be </segment2>
		<segment3>Perfectly safe and complacent. Those are words Your love's replaced. With fearless and brave, and courageous. Yeah, that's who I am today </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS: I'm waving goodbye to my pretty little life. Taking your hand and crossing that line </segment4>
		<segment5>Daring to leave the old me. Shout it out loud, I'm not ashamed. Diving in now, and so not afraid. Hello to all that You see. And everything You made me. I'm daring to be </segment5>
		<segment6>BRIDGE: Can you hear it?. Calling every heart to come alive. Pulling us deeper. To the life that we were meant to find. And it starts tonight </segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS: I'm waving goodbye to my pretty little life. Taking your hand and crossing that line. Daring to leave the old me. Shout it out loud, I'm not ashamed. Diving in now, and so not afraid. Hello to all that You see. And everything You made me. I'm daring to be    </segment7>
