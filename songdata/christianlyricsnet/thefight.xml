		<segment1>Would you go to war for me, baby. Would you cry for the weak. And die for the peace of men. Oh how can we know. You and I both know. So let's make this boatload of excuses burn and sing </segment1>
		<segment2>One day it all comes down to this. You can sink or swim. You can hit or miss. One day it all comes down. One day we all go down </segment2>
		<segment3>I'll take my heart back. And set the people free. I'll leave the dead to die. And take who's coming with me </segment3>
		<segment4>Step back for all the world to see. Your life means all the world to me. I'll take your pain and suffering. I'm such a sucker sometimes. Sometimes we don't know. So plug up those bullet holes. Oh you feel so close, don't let go until I say </segment4>
		<segment5>One day we'll drink to this and say. &quot;Remember when we died?. We went out in flames.&quot;. One day we'll drink to this and say. &quot;Remember when we died?. We went out!&quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll take my heart back. And set the people free. I'll leave the dead to die. And take who's coming with me. I'll take my heart back. And set the people free. I'll leave the dead to die. There will be blood in the streets.</segment6>
		<segment7>I'll take my heart back. And set the people free. I'll leave the dead to die. And take who's coming. And take who's coming with me!.     </segment7>
