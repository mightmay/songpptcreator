		<segment1>I've lived this day a thousand times it won't go away. And all I can see are the eyes of people I will never be. And it makes me ill the way. You love me still</segment1>
		<segment2>I can't decide if You're the missing piece buried in my mind. Immersed in sand I try to reach try to take Your hand. And it makes me ill the way You love me still</segment2>
		<segment3>I think back to the days I was around. And it brings me down to a place I've never been. I think back on a picture of a child and dream awhile. All the more I miss Your perfect ever shaking heart</segment3>
		<segment4>Solace came with a drop of blood and a taste of shame. When You took my turn You struck a match and You let it burn. And it makes me ill the way you love me still</segment4>
		<segment5>I think back to the days I was around. And it brings me down to a place I've never been. I think back on a picture of a child and dream awhile. All the more I miss Your perfect ever shaking heart.     </segment5>
