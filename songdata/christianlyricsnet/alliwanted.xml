		<segment1>Think of me when you're out, when you're out there. I'll beg you nice from my knees. And when the world treats you way too fairly. Well, it's a shame I'm a dream</segment1>
		<segment2>All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you</segment2>
		<segment3>I think I'll pace my apartment a few times. And fall asleep on the couch. And wake up early to black and white reruns. That escaped from the mouth, oh, oh</segment3>
		<segment4>All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you</segment4>
		<segment5>I could follow you to the beginning. Just to relive the start. And maybe then we'll remember to slow down. And all of our favorite parts</segment5>
		<segment6>All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you. All I wanted was you.     </segment6>
