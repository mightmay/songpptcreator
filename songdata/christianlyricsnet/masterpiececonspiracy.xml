		<segment1>Evil eyes behind their smiles. You swallow it up when sincerity lies. Lock me up, label me dangerous files. Fear of the unknown, so scared of my style. Alert the press and address the states of emergency. We the crew you love to hate. First mistake, you were never ready. Dance with the dead, better be ten times more deadly. This is me, Im always the same. Virus in the system, crash the mainframe. Uprise, now fall in line. Roll with the pack or get left behind </segment1>
		<segment2>chorus: Its a Masterpiece Conspiracy. Id rather hear it from you than be lied to. Call it what it is like the heathens do. Red lights of betrayal, deceived again. Exposed by the light, true colors ascend. Take down the regime, break the trend. Bumrushed by your peers and your so-called friends. Keep your people tight, watch your enemies close. Trust what you know, soon enough theyll choke. Where were you when we started this thing?. You werent around, this aint yours to claim. Youll never take whats been given to us. Wipe that smile off your face and that look of disgust. Uprise, now fall in line. Roll with the pack, or get left behind </segment2>

		<segment4>bridge: Liar, deceiver, betrayer, back stabber </segment4>
