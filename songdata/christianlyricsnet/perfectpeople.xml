		<segment1>Never let 'em see you when you're breaking. Never let 'em see you when you fall. That's how we live and that's how we try. Tell the world you've got it all together. Never let them see what's underneath. Cover it up with a crooked smile. But it only lasts for a little while</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. There's no such thing as perfect people. There's no such thing as a perfect life. So come as you are, broken and scarred. Lift up your heart and be amazed. And be changed by a perfect God</segment2>
		<segment3>Suddenly it's like a weight is lifted. When you hear the words that you are loved. He knows where you are and where you've been. And you never have to go there again</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>Who lived and died to give new life. To heal our imperfections. So look up and see love. Let grace be enough</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]</segment6>
		<segment7>By a perfect God [5x]</segment7>
		<segment8>Be changed by a perfect God. Be changed    </segment8>
