		<segment1>I've tried my best to hear out the masses, I've heard it all, from A to Z. I've read it all, been to all of the classes, And still I'm tryin' but I just can't see through the smoke.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I don't want it, this confusion, I don't want a false solution. Give me something to hold on to, I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.</segment2>
		<segment3>I know it's hard to be yourself when. you're not sure just who that is. All I wanted was satisfaction, but all I got was empty fists. Can you hear me?</segment3>
		<segment4>And I don't want it, this confusion, I don't want a false solution. Give me something to hold on to, I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.</segment4>
		<segment5>All I wanted was honesty, and that was something only you give. It took forever just to realize that I had to give myself away, so I could see your face and learn how to live. I can't erase your mark, you may take every thing else away.</segment5>
		<segment6>And I don't want it, this confusion, I don't want a false solution. Give me something to hold on to, I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.</segment6>
		<segment7>I want what you have 'cause you have what I need.     </segment7>
