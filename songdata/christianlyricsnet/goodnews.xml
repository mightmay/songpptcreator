		<segment1>The path we chose to walk on puts us. At a crossroad in our lives. But as long as I stand beside you. I know you'll never leave my side</segment1>
		<segment2>And it's you who makes the love shine in my life. And it's you who brings a tear to my eyes. And it's you who picks me up when I fall. And it's you..</segment2>
		<segment3>When I think of you I see a beauty that. Cannot be described by words. Then I sit and my mind goes and wanders. When I see those thoughts of you and. Love comes shining through. When I think of you all I want to do. Is share the goodnews.     </segment3>
