		<segment1>This door has been shut for days. And it's all too familiar. Can't I just crack a window. Can't I just shake it off?. I'm sure I've tasted this before. Everything is out of reach. And I just want to see outside. The air has been getting thin. I feel like cutting it open tonight. And falling on the floor. There's nothing left unused in here. There's nothing left to say. I haven't talked in days. and I'm really not too sure. What I sound like anymore. My vision has gone and my mouth is full of sores. I feel like dripping it dry tonight. Over and over again. It's time to open up the door    </segment1>
