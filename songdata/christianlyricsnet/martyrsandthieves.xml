		<segment1>There's a place in the darkness that I used to cling to. It presses harsh hope against time. In the absence of martyrs there's a presence of thieves. Who only want to rob you blind. They steal away any sense of peace. Though I'm a king I'm a king on my knees. And I know they are wrong when they say I am strong. As the darkness covers me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus-</segment2>
		<segment3>So turn on the light and reveal all the glory. I am not afraid. To bare all my weakness knowing in meekness. I have a kingdom to gain. Where there is peace and love in the light, in the light. Oh I am not afraid. To let Your light shine bright in my life, in my life. Oh I.. am, I..</segment3>
		<segment4>There are ghosts from my past who've owned more of my soul. Than I thought I had given away. They linger in closets and under my bed. And in pictures less proudly displayed. A great fool in my life I have been. Have squandered till pallid and thin. Hung my head in shame and refused to take blame. For the darkness I know I've let win</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Can you hear me? (repeat 6x)</segment6>
		<segment7>Well I've never been much for the baring of soul. In the presence of any man. I'd rather keep to myself all safe and secure. In the arms of a sinner I am. Could it be that my worth should depend. By the crimson stained grace on a hand. And like a lamp on a hill Lord I pray in Your will. To reveal all of You that I can</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)</segment8>
		<segment9>There's a place in the darkness that I used to cling to. It presses harsh hope against time..</segment9>
