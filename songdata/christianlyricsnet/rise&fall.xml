		<segment1>Our defenses open. Our motives are shot. This hush of the heart seems too much to keep. It's gathered here and wakening me. It's stealing with fear that's reaching in. And pulling out with every beat. Resounding loud and clear, but only to me. In this confiding pulse. I'll find a way to keep it all confined. It's reminding me and always surrounding me. Past pictures will keep me. From being the man I could be. Burn out and I'll burn now. I'll carry this burden of memory. A name that lingers on a blank face. Can never fill a heart that's sinking fast. And hurting to feel. It's falling so fast now. To never rise again. We all burn out. We all rise and fall. We all burn now    </segment1>
