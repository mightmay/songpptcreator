		<segment1>Why, for what do we strive that will bring, bring us closer. No human deed will show us approved. For two thousand years we've chocked on our efforts. Only to lay down and die. Things change. And things stay the same. Through all these trials. I cannot compose myself. Till there is a time. That no heaviness. Fills my heart. I cannot compose myself. So in all this there must arise a plan. A strategy to subdue the schemes. For generation upon generation God retained a silence. That shattered the hears of men. And for a season, all else, all else failed. Because I'm different. There is no other name. Given among men whereby. They might be saved in all these years. When men crawled the earth. Choking on his tears. No composure nor completion reigned. No self-righteous cleansing. Leaning on the strength of self or another man. No human effort can bring holiness. Or even the strength to stand. There is no explanation for this reasoning. The only thing in life that is constant is Jesus.     </segment1>
