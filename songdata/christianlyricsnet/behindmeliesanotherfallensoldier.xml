		<segment1>I want to bring You all that is in my heart. I want to bring You my everything. But I've failed You so many times. How can I stand here before You. When I begin to steal what only belongs to You. I am able to bring You nothing that isn't already Yours. I am so ashamed of what I ever called my own. Take what I have, take these broken remains. What can I give You that You don't already deserve. You laid down Your life when I refused to give mine    </segment1>
