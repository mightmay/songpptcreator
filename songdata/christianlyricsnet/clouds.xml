		<segment1>The clouds are coming in again. This always happens to me. And I am caught between. Im caught between Your love. And this world thats against me. I know that Youre not that far away. Hello, hello. Im not alone. You make daylight from grey. Hello, hello. Youre always lifting me above the clouds. Troubles on the way today. Why does this happen to me. You see. That Im left mixed up. Mixed up between Your love. And this world thats against me. You are the face of love. You are the face of love to me. Im living here above the clouds.     </segment1>
