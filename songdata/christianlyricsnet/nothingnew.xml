		<segment1>Ahh, Give me time to watch this go. I will pack all my dreams and I'll go home. Ahh, Once again I'm nothing new. Quick to speak, slow to listen and quick to lose. I'm fine, just lies to keep you from the truth. Fit in, belong, what's wrong? Is there something I can do?. There is, my friend. Please help me this through. I still don't know why You forgive. I guess there's hope, the reason I still live. And when they hear this song they'll right it off because of faith, not because of things I do or say.</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm fine, just lies to keep you from the truth. Fit in, belong, what's wrong? Is there something I can do?. There is, my friend, these words will stick like glue.</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord take my life, cuz it's better off with You. I slip. I fall. By now it's nothing new. Lord help me see cuz You've got a better view. Take what's left and make it something new.</segment3>
		<segment4>Just because I never learned to give up. Challenge my beliefs. I will choose to stand up. Overcoming fears, Compromising never. Til' the very end, We will be together.    </segment4>
