		<segment1>I'm sick and tired on the world tellin' me. How to live my life. What beer I should drink to make me feel alright. The standards dropping the streets need mopping. The worlds tryin' to change the rules. They've forgotten just how we begun. Humanism taken ist toll</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. We'll know who's right in the end. Every knee shall bow. We'll know who's right in the end. Every tongue confess</segment2>
		<segment3>So be a man and make up your mind. How to live your life. What standard have you set. To make you feel alright. The church is rising, no compromising. Holiness is cool. Men laugh, in the end they'll die. Evolutionists will pay the toll</segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus -</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm sick and tired of the world tellin' me. How to live my life. What beer I should drink to make me feel alright. The standards dropping the streets need mopping. The worlds tryin' to change the rules. They've forgotten just how we begun. Humanism has taken its toll</segment5>
		<segment6>- Chorus -    </segment6>
