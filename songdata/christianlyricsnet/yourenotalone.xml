		<segment1>When I look at you. I see your soul. So fragile and beautiful. I know I have made. So many mistakes. I can't deny I'll take the blame</segment1>
		<segment2>I wish I could heal. That look in your eyes. If you won't feel too compromised. So I get down. Down on my knees. And I hear You say. These words to me</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: You're not alone / You're not alone. Even though you feel so far from home. You're not alone / You're not alone. And if you just stop and look around. You're not the only one</segment3>
		<segment4>The kind of love. That you choose to give. Is the only thing that matters right now. Don't try to judge. Just try to forgive. Cause we all have mistakes we live with</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>Are you feeling separated from love. And the way you thought this life should be. Just open your heart. Hear these words. That were said to me. And say to me</segment6>
		<segment7>You're not alone / You're not alone. And if you just stop and look around. You're not alone / You're not alone. Even though you feel so far from home. You're not alone / You're not alone. And if you just stop and look around</segment7>
		<segment8>You're not alone..     </segment8>
