		<segment1>Bob Hartman. Acts 17:27</segment1>
		<segment2>Living water - I am thirsty and dry. Bread of heaven - only You satisfy. I am waiting for Your comfort and peace. Come and fill me, let this emptiness cease</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). I will seek You. I will find You. I will follow what I know is true. I will seek You. Like I used to. I will worship You</segment3>
		<segment4>You are holy, You are a wonder to me. In creation I see Your majesty</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Speak to me and I will listen. (Give me the call and point the way). Lead me on and I will follow. (Hearing Your Word I will obey)</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)    </segment7>
