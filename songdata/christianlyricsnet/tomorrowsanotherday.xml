		<segment1>I don't want to let my life fly by. Do you ever stop, stop to wonder why?</segment1>
		<segment2>And time flies by. When everything is ok. It just turns out that life ain't that way. Big decisions overwhelm me and I know nothing's free</segment2>
		<segment3>When I don't think of, think about much. People die and we don't know why. I could use some understanding. Human contact, sign that contract</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't want to let my life fly by. Did you ever stop to wonder why-ever. stop to wonder, wonder why?</segment4>
		<segment5>And time stands still when no one understands you. When you don't quite understand yourself. But just know this that God is faithful. Even if you don't have faith yourself</segment5>
		<segment6>There's nothing quite like being sure of. What's inside your heart. It's mostly simple but not so easy. To know just where to start</segment6>
		<segment7>Today didn't have to be this way. Tomorrow is another day. Another chance to make things right. A chance to make sense of last night</segment7>
		<segment8>A chance to fully live your life. I don't want to, I don't want to, you don't want to    </segment8>
