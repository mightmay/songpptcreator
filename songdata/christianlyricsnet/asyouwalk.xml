		<segment1>Just one last cigarette and fly. Coincidences made sorrow rule over your soul. I'm standing with my wings around you. I cry</segment1>
		<segment2>So try to show you're a man. You're nobody's toy. There is nothing that separates a man from a boy</segment2>
		<segment3>Thought so dark you got lost in there. Lost your way home and now it's getting late. I long to greet you when you come home. But don't you leave earth in this state</segment3>
		<segment4>No don't you leave earth in this state. I'm the soft whisper of peace in your ear. As all of this creates. No night vision in this forest of darkness. And I feel what you feel inside. And as your skin got burned mine did too when they lied</segment4>
		<segment5>And you know I'm pulling you closer    </segment5>
