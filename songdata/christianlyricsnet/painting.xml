		<segment1>The world you painted was new. The colors were so alive. Took a lie and made it true. A final touch and then right into the painting you dive </segment1>
		<segment2>It's ok if you break. You'll see colors again. This is more than you can take. You'll see colors again. It's your life that's at stake. You'll see colors again. Don't you think it's my time, anytime soon </segment2>
		<segment3>Whenever did it all happen. That one color after another seems to fade. Now the sky is carved with a coalpen. It's all gray despite the effort you made </segment3>
		<segment4>How do you like your god now. Now that he is you. Does he feel dead somehow. And where does that leave you </segment4>
		<segment5>It's ok if you break. You'll see colors again. This is more than you can take. You'll see colors again. It's your life that's at stake. You'll see colors again. Don't you think it's my time, anytime soon    </segment5>
