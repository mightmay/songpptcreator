		<segment1>Holy is a tough word. In the vocab of man. To separate ourselves. From the jaws of sin. Wise is the man. That fears the great I AM</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm called to serve my God. I'm called to serve my Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>Should I rouse myself to this. Unsullied walking with the feet. Unsullied talking with the tongue. Unsullied thinking with the mind. The destined end of man. Is not happiness nor health</segment3>
		<segment4>But holiness with God. But holiness with God</segment4>
		<segment5>When God begins to check. Do not confer with flesh. But cleanse yourself at once</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm declaring the claim. I'm declaring the claim. The Father has on me. I'm declaring the claim. I'm declaring the claim    </segment6>
