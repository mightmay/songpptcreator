		<segment1>King or cripple what have I become?. Beneath these kingly robes there lies a fragile man. What made me a king can sometimes cripple. All that you give can sometimes rob my innocence</segment1>
		<segment2>Why do you let us walk upon a cliff so steep. When deep below the sea there lies a bed of gold. And if this should be our battle place. Don't let me fall, don't let us fall</segment2>
		<segment3>Keep me, keep me, keep me, keep me</segment3>
		<segment4>I love to hold the hand of one who healed the blind. And saw the leper run into your arms of love. King or cripple, they were the same to you. You took the broken man and you treat him like a king    </segment4>
