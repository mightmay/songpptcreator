		<segment1>You might sleep, but you'll never dream. Onward! Progress! Or so it seems. You might laugh, but you'll never smile. Come on in and waste away awhile. </segment1>
		<segment2>When dreams of rings of flowers fade and blur. Giving way to that familiar ill. come over and part your soft white curtains. Where I'm waiting for you still. If you'd unlatch the window, If you'd let me lay there on your floor. If you'd give me another chance, If you'd forget the pain I caused before. No use in saying how I'm sorry. So I'm trying not to speak. I'll sing in silence, lay beside you. With my face there on your cheek. My stomach swears there's comfort there. In the warmth of the blankets on your bed. My stomach's always been a liar-. I'll believe it's lies again.     </segment2>
