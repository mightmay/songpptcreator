		<segment1>[In your light we see light. Psalm 36:9]. in your light we see the light. in your touch we learn to touch. in your life we are alive. in your love we learn to love</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. all that I know of true. begins and ends in you. let everything I do. begin and end in you</segment2>
		<segment3>in your peace we find our peace. in your strength we learn to stand. in your arms we find release. in your hands we are your hands    </segment3>
