		<segment1>Every bit of history. And every single breath we breathe. Has led us here and brought us to our knees. From carrying the curse we bear. And praying that HeÂ’s heard our prayers. To set us free. Oh, set us free</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause we could never get back home with broken hearts. So Home has come to meet us where we are</segment2>
		<segment3>So sing, God is with us. Sing, He has come to save us. Sing, He will never leave us. Glory in the highest, everybody sing. To the One who is our King. He has come to bring redemption to us. God is with us. Glory in the highest, everybody sing</segment3>
		<segment4>We have found our hope again. In the Son of God and Son of Man. This Savior King is changing all we know. By carrying the curse we bear. For everybody everywhere. He lived and died and brought us life. And we will rise to meet Him in the sky</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus, Jesus, our Emmanuel. God is with us now</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause we could never get back home with broken hearts. So Home has come to us    </segment6>
