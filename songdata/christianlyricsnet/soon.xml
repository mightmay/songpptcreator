		<segment1>Soon and very soon. My King is coming. Robed in righteousness and crowned with love. When I see Him. I shall be made like Him. Soon and very soon</segment1>
		<segment2>Soon and very soon. Ill be going. To the place He has prepared for me. There my sin erased. My shame forgotten. Soon and very soon</segment2>
		<segment3>I will be with the One I love. With unveiled face Ill see Him. There my soul will be satisfied. Soon and very soon</segment3>
		<segment4>Soon and very soon. See the procession. The angels and the elders 'round the throne. At His feet Ill lay my crowns My worship. Soon and very soon</segment4>
		<segment5>I will be with the One I love. With unveiled face Ill see Him. There my soul will be satisfied. Soon and very soon</segment5>
		<segment6>Though I have not seen Him. My heart knows Him well. Jesus Christ the Lamb. The Lord of heaven</segment6>
		<segment7>I will be with the One I love. With unveiled face Ill see Him. There my soul will be satisfied. Soon and very soon. Soon and very soon     </segment7>
