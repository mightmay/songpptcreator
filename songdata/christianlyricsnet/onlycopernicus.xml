		<segment1>telescope, I see you. have a vision for me. nights spent in solitude. of discovery. I don't know. if I have the courage to speak. of what i've discovered</segment1>
		<segment2>only copernicus. measurements of magnificence. only copernicus. instruments of intelligence. only copernicus. symmetry of astronomy. only copernicus. blasphemy and heresy</segment2>
		<segment3>instruments, I see you. have a number for me. my words sync with your words. as I state my beliefs. I don't know. if I have the courage to speak. of what i've discovered    </segment3>
