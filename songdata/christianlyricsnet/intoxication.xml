		<segment1>Verse 1: I will not let them cure my disease. They will never put my mind at ease. I dont think that they can comprehend. The beginning of a life is at its end. Label this as pure insanity. Trying to keep me from society. Looking for a truth that they can bend. Hearing for a faith that won't defend</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Your intoxication. Pushes me over the edge. Your intoxication. Keeps messing with my head</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Searching everyday for just a taste. The thirst is getting stronger as I wait. Numbing all my senses. I will take my chances. Knowing at the end will be my fate. Drunken with my curiosity. Giving up my mediocrity. I will not go back. Seeing what they lack. Living by a system of deceit    </segment3>
