		<segment1>Every morning there's a warning that you follow. It's getting harder you know. To fill the moments of the morning. They're so hollow. Fill up on empty and go</segment1>
		<segment2>And every morning there's a brokenness you swallow. You try to let go. Of every warning that your wanting, want to follow?. Your signs are starting to show</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: I can see it in your eyes. You were made to overcome. I can see it in your eyes. You were made to rise above. I can see it in your eyes. So take these wings and fly</segment3>
		<segment4>And for tomorrow there's a bottom of a bottle. It's getting harder you know. To dry the problem at the bottom of a bottle. Before it's out of control</segment4>
		<segment5>(CHORUS)</segment5>
		<segment6>And every morning there's a warning that you follow. It's getting harder you know</segment6>
		<segment7>(CHORUS)    </segment7>
