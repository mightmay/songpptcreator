		<segment1>It's crowded in worship today. As she slips in trying to fade into the faces. The girls teasing laughter is carrying farther than they know. Farther than they know</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: But if we are the body. Why aren't His arms reaching?. Why aren't His hands healing?. Why aren't His words teaching?. And if we are the body. Why aren't His feet going?. Why is His love not showing them there is a way?. There is a way</segment2>
		<segment3>A traveler is far away from home. He sheds his coat and quietly sinks into the back row. The weight of their judgmental glances. Tells him that his chances are better out on the road</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus paid much too high a price. For us to pick and choose who should come. And we are the body of Christ</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus is the way    </segment5>
