		<segment1>I am a thief, I am a murderer. Walking up this lonely hill. What have I done? I don't remember. No one knows just how I feel. and I know that my time is coming soon. It's been so long. Oh, such a long time. Since I've lived with peace and rest. Now I am here, my destination. guess things work for the best. and I know that my time is coming soon. Who is this man? This man beside me. They call the King of the Jews. They don't believe that He's the Messiah. But, somehow I know it's true. And they laugh at Him in mockery, and beat Him till he bleeds. They nail Him to the rugged cross, and raise Him, they raise Him up next to me. My time has come, I'm slowly fading. I deserve what I receive. Jesus when You are in Your kingdom. Could You please remember me. and He looks at me still holding on. the tears fall from His eyes. He says I tell the truth. Today, you will live with Me in paradise. and I know that my time is coming soon. and I know paradise is coming soon.    </segment1>
