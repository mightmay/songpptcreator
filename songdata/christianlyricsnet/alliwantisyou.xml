		<segment1>I've waited all my life to be here face to face. I never knew that I could feel this kind of grace. The way You show me that Your blood has washed me clean, Could never be erased; it lives inside of me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Take me to that secret place, Where I can only see Your Face, And nothing else will ever feel this way. You take away my guilty stains, The things I've done that I can't change, It's only by the Power of Your name.</segment2>
		<segment3>I stand here in this place, See the Glory on Your Face, Taken by the wonder of Your name. I'm desperate for Your touch, Never needed it so much, Cause all I want is You.</segment3>
		<segment4>When all the things around me have fallen to the ground. I'm always thankful for the love in You I've found.    </segment4>
