		<segment1>Inside of me I can see the hope of glory. Years ago He came knocking on my door. Inside of me I can hear a simple question. Just whose glory am I hoping for. Make it disappear. Everything I built with my hands. Make it disappear</segment1>
		<segment2>Kick it over like a castle of sand. 'Til nothing stands. Inside of me I can feel the ghost of freedom. Busy trying to clear a place of rest. He listens well so here's my request. Let my kingdom fall. Every castle, every wall. Let my kingdom fall.    </segment2>
