		<segment1>And here we go again. With all the things we said. And not a minute spent. To think that we'd regret. So we just take it back, These words and hold our breath. Forget the things we swore we meant</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll write you just to let you know that I'm alright. Can't say I'm sad to see you go. Cause I'm not. (No, I'm not). Well, I'm not.</segment2>
		<segment3>And here we go again. With all the things we did. And now I'm wondering. Just who would I have been. To be the one attached. At all times to your hip?. Forget the things we swore we meant.</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll write you just to let you know that I'm alright. Can't say I'm sad to see you go. Cause I'm not. (No, I'm not). Well, I'm not. (No, I'm not). Oh (No, I'm not)</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll write you to, to let you know that I'm alright. Can't say I'm sad to see you go. Cause I'm not. (No, I'm not). Well, I'm not. (No, I'm not). I'm not, I'm not.</segment5>
		<segment6>And here we go again. With all the things we said. And not a minute spent. To think that we'd regret. So we just take it back.. (No, I'm not). So we just take it back.. (I'm not). So we just take it back..    </segment6>
