		<segment1>The corporate beast has got me. I've fallen in the trap. This beast it feeds on me. I'm never coming back.</segment1>
		<segment2>You've sucked the truth out of me. Abolished honesty. I can't escape, it's got me. Independence dying slowly.</segment2>
		<segment3>Welcome to the Machine. Welcome to the Machine. It's eating me alive. Welcome to the Machine. Welcome to the Machine. Sell out your life or die.</segment3>
		<segment4>In pursuit of your polished altars, you dream in presidents. Sell your god, sell your faith, and market prices rising fast.</segment4>
		<segment5>I never asked for this. My intentions were pure. I never meant to enlist in the corporate music war.</segment5>
		<segment6>Welcome to the Machine. Welcome to the Machine. It's eating me alive. Welcome to the Machine. Welcome to the Machine. Sell out your life or die.</segment6>
		<segment7>Your world is painted mint green. You believe green is everything.</segment7>
		<segment8>This machine has taken me away. This machine has got me.</segment8>
		<segment9>The corporate beast has got me. I've fallen in the trap. This beast it feeds on me. I'm never coming back.</segment9>
		<segment10>Welcome to the Machine. Welcome to the Machine. It's eating me alive. Welcome to the Machine. Welcome to the Machine. Sell out your life or die.    </segment10>
