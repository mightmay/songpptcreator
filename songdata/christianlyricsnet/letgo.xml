		<segment1>Yeah I trust in You. I remember times You led me. This time it's bigger now. And I'm afraid You'll let me down</segment1>
		<segment2>But how can I be certain?. Will You prove Yourself again?</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. 'Cause I'm about to let go. And live what I believe. I can't do a thing now. But trust that You'll catch me. When I let go. When I let go</segment3>
		<segment4>What is this doubt in me. Convincing me to fear the unknown. When all along You've shown. Your plans are better than my own</segment4>
		<segment5>And I know I won't make it. If I do this all alone    </segment5>
