		<segment1>vs1. put your head upon my shoulder. lay the hammer at your side. storms inside this tiny artist. dream in marble, shapes and light</segment1>
		<segment2>forging through to whats becoming. so much wearing at your heart. though the knife and chisel break you. there will be a work of art</segment2>
		<segment3>ch. you are throwing yourself at the stone. cause you see the shape and the form of his face. what your hands cannot break. and david waits</segment3>
		<segment4>vs2. speaking words over the darkness. like the artist of the earth. in the image, daughter, father. your creation your rebirth</segment4>
		<segment5>ch</segment5>
		<segment6>bridge. on the other side of brokenness. the way your heart connects to his. both must be free for the beauty to be revealed.     </segment6>
