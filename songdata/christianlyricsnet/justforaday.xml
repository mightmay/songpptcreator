		<segment1>When I think of all the things you've done for me. It brings a smile to my face. And so I close my eyes to suddenly see. Memories of my sweetest days, sweetest days. But I never said thank you, I never really tried. And when I think about it I just wanna cry. There are so many things that I wanna say. I would do anything to see you</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Just for a dayshoop. Just for a dayshoop. I know I love you, I tell myself. I just didn't know how to say it</segment2>
		<segment3>But I wonder if you hear me, when I pray at night. Sometimes I forget that you're by my side. Did you know that you were the reason I live my life. Lord, I would do anything to see you</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Just for a dayjust for a dayjust for a day. Anythinganything    </segment5>
