		<segment1>(Against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood. Against principalities. Against powers. Against the rulers of darkness of this age. Against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places)</segment1>
		<segment2>Anvils fall from your lips. Like shrapnel bits from these metal fists. Pounding my back without mercy with. An arsenal of foul curses. Attitude without gratitude is like pulverizing my chest. you dream to take me down..</segment2>
		<segment3>So heres your goodbye kiss</segment3>
		<segment4>Devastator. Complicator. Bringer of pain. Why wont you fly away?</segment4>
		<segment5>(Therefore take up the whole armor of God. that you may be able to withstand in the evil day. and having done all to stand. with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one)</segment5>
		<segment6>Now you jumped the fence. As enemies, they transform to friends. Spitting your venom at my back, and. Asleep in the dragons lair. Loyaltys not your currency, how soon you do forget. You think youve found your wings. But youll never fly again</segment6>
		<segment7>Fly away. Disappear, and just disappear and just. Fly away. Erasing me from your memory..    </segment7>
