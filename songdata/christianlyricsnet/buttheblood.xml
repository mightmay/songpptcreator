		<segment1>Born alone and left to dye. Rejected, often criticized. Hid behind the childhood lies. Everything has changed since the Blood. Since the Blood. Since the Blood. Oh, the Blood</segment1>
		<segment2>Born alone and left to dye. Rejected, often criticized. Hid behind the childhood lies. Everything has changed since the Blood. (Falling on us). Since the Blood (Gave me purpose). Since the Blood (It says you're for us). Since the Blood (who can be against us)</segment2>
		<segment3>Hopeless fallen from the air. Reaching but no one is there. Screaming, quiet, no one cares. I might as well have died. But the Blood (Falling on us). But the Blood (Gave me purpose). But the Blood (it says you're for us). Oh, the Blood (who can be against us)</segment3>
		<segment4>[Choir:]. Oh, the cleansing power. That takes the guilt away. The Lamb was sacrificed now we. No longer fear the grave. No more condemnation. The debt of man is paid</segment4>
		<segment5>By the Blood. But for the Blood [Repeat]</segment5>
		<segment6>Now we are never alone. Your Blood, it makes us strong. Now there is power to move on. Never, we are never alone. [Repeat]    </segment6>
