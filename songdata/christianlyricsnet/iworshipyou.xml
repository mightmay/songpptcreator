		<segment1>I've been walking with a big grin. singing with my eyes closed. liftin' up my hands. I've been lost in the moment. sendin' up praises. now I think I understand</segment1>
		<segment2>When I open up and let it flow. I feel your touch and then I know.</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I can never live without it. and I'm never gonna doubt it. everyday is new. yeah. there's nothing any better. I'll be singing it forever. I worship You</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm standing on the edge now. looking to a new place. goin' deeper still. the feeling is electric. the Power and the Glory. just move me where You will</segment4>
		<segment5>cuz you take this song and make it fly. into my soul and that is why</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>I just wanna dive into your grace. I wanna feel your presence, seek your face. I just wanna be where you are</segment7>
		<segment8>I can never live without it. and I'm never gonna doubt it. everyday is new yea</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus 2x)    </segment9>
