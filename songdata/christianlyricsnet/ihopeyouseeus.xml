		<segment1>Instead of fear. Instead of blinded eyes. Instead of shame. Instead of all my lies. Instead of an orphan without a name. I hope you see Jesus </segment1>
		<segment2>Instead of anger. Instead of unbelief. Instead of weakness in the heart of me. Instead of a wounded soul that sometimes loses faith. I hope you see Jesus </segment2>
		<segment3>I hope you see Jesus. I hope you see Jesus. Standing in my place. Bearing all my shame. I hope you see Jesus </segment3>
		<segment4>Instead of voices in a faceless crowd. Instead of prophets crying out from behind the shroud. Instead of fingers pointing out the blame. I hope you see Jesus </segment4>
		<segment5>I hope you see Jesus </segment5>
		<segment6>I hope you see Jesus. Standing in my place. Bearing all my shame. I hope you see Jesus </segment6>
		<segment7>I hope you see love. I hope you see love. I hope you see love </segment7>
		<segment8>Oh My God, when you look at us. A broken people who have turned from love. Instead of the words we throw and the wars we wage. I hope you forgive us. I hope you see Jesus. I hope you see Jesus. I hope you see Jesus. Standing in our place. Bearing all our shame. I hope you see Jesus. Standing in my place. Bearing all my shame. I hope you see Jesus    </segment8>
