		<segment1>I will survive through all this strife, and as the day grows older, so do I, and as the ashes fall, and cover your eyes, and stitching your mind closed. This war enflames, have you chosen your side, I have chosen God. I, fight this with, I fight this with God on my side. forever and you just shun Him to make your life seem guilt free. And I cry for you, and I cry for you. He gave his life for you. He gave his life for you    </segment1>
