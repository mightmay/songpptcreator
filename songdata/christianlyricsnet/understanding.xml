		<segment1>Does not wisdom cry out?. Does not understanding raise her voice?. There is a reason. I know there is a reason. I dig and I keep digging. Haven't I found you yet?. What could have driven you to this?. I want to understand you. But I can't, and I still search. And I want to find some reasons. And I want to find some answers. And when I find some answers, new questions will arise. Why do people do what they do?. Why can't people just see you?. This world is full of so many lies. Satan owns the lie and we are all being fooled. We're all being fooled. Save us. Save us from this world of hate.     </segment1>
