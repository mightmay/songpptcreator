		<segment1>MEEKNESS AND MAJESTY, Manhood and Deity, In perfect harmony, The Man who is God. Lord of eternity. Dwells in humanity, Kneels in humility. And washes our feet.</segment1>
		<segment2>O what a mystery, Meekness and majesty. Bow down and worship. For this is your God, This is your God.</segment2>
		<segment3>Father's pure radiance, Perfect in innocence, Yet learns obedience. To death on a cross. Suffering to give us life, Conquering through sacrifice, And as they crucify. Prays: 'Father forgive.'</segment3>
		<segment4>Wisdom unsearchable, God the invisible, Love indestructible. In frailty appears. Lord of infinity, Stooping so tenderly, Lifts our humanity. To the heights of His throne.</segment4>
