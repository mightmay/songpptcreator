		<segment1>I can't say, that everything' ok, Cause I can see the tears your crying. And I can't promise to take the pain away. But you can you know i won't stop trying.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I'll be an angel by your side, I will get you through the night. I'll be the strength you can provide on your own. Cause when your down and out of time, and you think you've lost the fight. Let me be the angel, the angel by your side.</segment2>
		<segment3>I know it feels like your running out of faith, Cause its so hard to keep believing, oh. But if I can bring, a smile back to your face. for a moment, you'll forget all about it, oh.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: I'll be an angel by your side, I will get you through the night. I'll be the strength you can provide on your own. Cause when your down and out of time, and you think you've lost the fight. Let me be the angel, the angel by your side.</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: Cause this won't be the last time. you'll need a little hope. But I wanna be the first to let you know.</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: I'll be an angel by your side, I will get you through the night. I'll be the strength you can provide on your own. Cause when your down and out of time, and you think you've lost the fight. Let me be the angel, the angel by your side.</segment6>
		<segment7>Let me be the angel, the angel by your side, ooohh.</segment7>
