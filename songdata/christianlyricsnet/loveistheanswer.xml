		<segment1>Name your price. A ticket to paradise. I can't stay here any more. And I've looked high and low. . Lord I've been from shore to shore. And if there's a short cut. I'd have found it. But there's no easy way around it. . Light of the world shine on me. Love is the answer. Shine on us all set us free. Love is the answer. . Who knows why. Someday we all must die. We're all homeless boys and girls. And we're never ever heard. . It's such a lonely lonely world. People turn their heads. And walk on by. Tell me is it worth just another try?. . Light of the world shine on me. Love is the answer. Shine on us all set us free. Love is the answer. . We gotta love one another. When you feel afraid. When you've lost your way. Hey when you're all alone. (Love one another). When you're far from far from home. (Love one another). . When you're down and out. (Love one another). All your hope's run out. (Love one another). . I said you need a friend. (Love one another). When you're near the end love. We got to love. . Light of the world shine on me. Love is the answer. Shine on us all set us free. Love is the answer. . Light of the world shine on me. Love is the answer. Shine on us all set us free. Love is the answer. . Light of the world shine on me. Love is the answer. Shine on us all set us free. Love is the answer    </segment1>
