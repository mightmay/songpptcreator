		<segment1>I wake to see the sun rise from her slumber. I hear the birds sing their songs of love. A knowing smile warms my face, I remember. To be thankful, its a beautiful day. My lost and lonely heart was calling. Out to find the way</segment1>
		<segment2>Then I found You, wonderful You. Like a dream You came, let me live again. Oh, now theres You, glorious You. I need forever to know You way</segment2>
		<segment3>There was a time when peace of mind just eluded me. And the sun was always clouded from my view. But You opened up my heart to see a new day. Now this fire within me needs to praise. I once was lost, but then You found me. Im in Your arms to stay</segment3>
		<segment4>How I love You, wonderful You. Like a dream You came, let me live again. Oh, now theres You, beautiful You. I need forever to know You way</segment4>
		<segment5>Take my hand. Show me the Word. Change my heart. Oh, let it be true</segment5>
		<segment6>Take my hand. Show me the Word. Change my heart. Oh, let it be true</segment6>
		<segment7>My lost and lonely heart was calling. Out to find the way. Oh, I once was lost, and then You found me. Im in Your arms to stay</segment7>
		<segment8>Now Ive got You, wonderful You. Like a dream You came, let me live again. Oh, now theres You, glorious You. I need forever to know You way</segment8>
		<segment9>How I love You, wonderful You. Like a dream You came, let me live again. Oh, I love You, beautiful You. I need forever to know You way    </segment9>
