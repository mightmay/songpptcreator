		<segment2>Gina works the diner all day. Working for her man, she brings home her pay. For love - For love. She says  we've got to hold on to what we've got.  it doesn't make a diffrence if we make it or not. we've got each other . and that's a lot For love - we'll give it a shot</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Whooah, we're half way there. Livin' on a prayer. Take my hand we'll make it. I swear. Livin' on a prayer</segment3>
		<segment4>Tommy's got his six string hock. Now he's holding in what he used. to make it talk. so tough, it's so tough</segment4>
		<segment5>Gina dreams of running away. when she cries in the night. Tommy whispers baby it's okay, someday. We've got to hold on to what we've got. 'cause it doesn't make a difference. if we make it or not. We've got each other and that's a lot. For love - we'll give it a shot</segment5>
