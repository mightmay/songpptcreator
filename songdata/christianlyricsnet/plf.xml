		<segment1>(verse 1). They say times are tough and so is he. Sometimes it's rough just to be alive. They say he never had opportunity. To prove his worth or just to be a man. So we'll just give him one more chance. We'll just give him one more chance. We'll just give him one more chance. And they say:</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Poor little fellow, they say. Poor little man, they say. Poor little fellow, they say. Poor little man. But I don't think so. Cause' you've got something, Something you'll never know, OH,OH</segment2>
		<segment3>(verse 2). I remember, a friend of mine, like a brother. But you always fell behind. Well I grew up and I watched you try. I held out my hand time after time. But then you kicked me in the face. You just kicked me in the face. You just kicked me in the face. And they say:</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>(bridge). Hey Mr. Nothing your calling is waiting. But your head's in the clouds and you're fading away. Away, Away</segment5>
		<segment6>(verse 3). I watched you find the truth, then you let it go. Then you picked it up. Whichever wind that blows. You're a Wanna Be of all you see. But they laugh at you. You're a walking comedy. And then you kicked me in the face. You just kicked me in the face. Go on and kick me in the face. And they say:</segment6>
		<segment7>(chorus)    </segment7>
