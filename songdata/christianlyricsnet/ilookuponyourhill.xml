		<segment1>I look upon Your hill. Your broken body hanging still. Your blood drips down. Your face and brow. You broght me life through death. No greater Love than this</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Surely He's borne our grief. Carried our sorrow. Though we've gone astray. It's by His stripes and wounds. We were healed. On that glorious day.</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh Lord, You've worn the crown. I've placed uponYour head. Oh Lord, I've pierced Your hands. Yet Your blood declares my innocence</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
