		<segment1>mixed up month. and too soon to be over me and you. with your sudden stop today. driving the last of us away. and the girl in rearview tries. i can only see her eyes. she's bracing for the crash. and i wonder who's at fault. as i'm screeching to a halt. but too late. words much too curt. do they smart?. does it hurt?. the pavement sweats beneath. slighting my efforts to relieve you. of the years it takes. but i only locked the brakes. and the girl in rearview tries. i can only see her eyes. she's bracing for the crash. and i wonder who's at fault. as i'm screeching to a halt. but too late. words much too curt. and you were inert. does it smart?. does it hurt?    </segment1>
