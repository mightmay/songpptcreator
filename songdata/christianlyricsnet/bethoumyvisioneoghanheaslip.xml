		<segment1>Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;. Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art. Thou my best Thought, by day or by night, Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.</segment1>
		<segment2>Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;. I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;. Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;. Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.</segment2>
		<segment3>Be Thou my battle Shield, Sword for the fight;. Be Thou my Dignity, Thou my Delight;. Thou my souls Shelter, Thou my high Tower: Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.</segment3>
		<segment4>Riches I heed not, nor mans empty praise, Thou mine Inheritance, now and always: Thou and Thou only, first in my heart, High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.</segment4>
		<segment5>High King of Heaven, my victory won, May I reach Heavens joys, O bright Heavens Sun!. Heart of my own heart, whatever befall, Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.    </segment5>
