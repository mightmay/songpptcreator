		<segment1>Oh, Mama, I've been cleared of my crimes and I'm not under the law. Law has been put an end to by somethin' that is so far above it all. Oh, Mama, I can hear you a-sighin', you're so scared it's all a joke. Examine Romans 10 for a while and then you'll know I can't be wrong. The Jesus love I knew about has finally found me. Made lemonade from my mistakes, the sweet from the soury. 10 verse 4 in Romans says disobedience ends with faith. In the Son of Man. Oh, Mama, I've believed on the Lamb of God, the High Priest of My Faith. God says that HeÂ’s forever alive so it's for sure He'll keep me saved. Dear Mama, back in Hebrews you will find it, in verse 7:24. Amen, I'm comin' out from the shadows and I don't have scary thoughts. They've taken off the noose around me, I will be found clean. The reservations had been made with Jesus on Calvary. Everyone has gone astray, but you can repent today. If you want it man. Oh, Mama, I've been cleared of my crimes and I'm not under the law. Amen, I'm comin' out from the shadows and I don't have scary thoughts. Hey, check this out, removed the doubts, the Bible astounds me. I read Galatians chapter 3:24 and zowie!. Twenty-four and -five explain, disobedience ends with grace. If you want it, man. Want it, man? </segment1>
