		<segment1>Tell me where our time went. And if it was time well spent. Just don't let me fall asleep. Feeling empty again</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause I fear I might break. and I fear I can't take it. Tonight I'll lie awake feeling empty</segment2>
		<segment3>I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you. I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you</segment3>
		<segment4>Now that I'm losing hope. And there's nothing else to show. For all of the days that we spent. Carried away from home</segment4>
		<segment5>Some things I'll never know. And I had to let them go. I'm sitting all alone feeling empty</segment5>
		<segment6>I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you. I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you</segment6>
		<segment7>Without you</segment7>
		<segment8>Some things I'll never know. And I had to let them go. Some things I'll never know. And I had to let them go. I'm sitting all alone feeling empty</segment8>
		<segment9>I can feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. We're better off without you</segment9>
		<segment10>Feel the pressure. It's getting closer now. You're better off without me    </segment10>
