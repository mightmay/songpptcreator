		<segment1>Wonderful is what I perceived, This life would be,  pain and problem free, But over time, I found reality. And through it all I see, That You're the Only One who gets me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I may be misunderstoood 'cause I wouldn't ever fake it. You're the Only One who understands my pain. You get me, You get me. It doesn't matter what they do, what they think, what they say, At the end of the day, I'm okay anyway. 'Cause Lord, You get me.</segment2>
		<segment3>No more tears; it's a silent night. You've broken down all fear, 'Cause You invaded all of me. You know me better than I know myself. The key to my security. There is no one else who gets me.</segment3>
		<segment4>I may be misunderstoood 'cause I wouldn't ever fake it. You're the Only One who understands my pain. You get me, You get me. It doesn't matter what they do, what they think, what they say, At the end of the day, I'm okay anyway. 'Cause Lord, You get me. Lord, You get me.</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't care what the world may say. I hear You call me by name, And I'll reach for You, reach for You. There is nothing that I'd rather do, Than just worship You, Lord. I'm gonna worship You, worship You.</segment5>
		<segment6>(I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay)*repeats again throughout the rest of the song</segment6>
		<segment7>I may be misunderstoood 'cause I wouldn't ever fake it. You're the Only One who understands my pain.(You're the Only One, You're the only One on second time around). You get me, You get me. It doesn't matter what they do, what they think, what they say, At the end of the day, I'm okay anyway. 'Cause Lord, You get me. Lord, You get me.  (2x)</segment7>
		<segment8>You understand me, so completely. When no gets me, Lord, You get me.(2x)    </segment8>
