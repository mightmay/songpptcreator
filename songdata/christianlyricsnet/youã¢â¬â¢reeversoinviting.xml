		<segment1>The time has come for you. To sit this one out. To fit inside your mold. Would be to sell myself short</segment1>
		<segment2>This ground we tread upon. We turn the pages left to right. Is now filling up to our necks. We see everything</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, my story's growing and growing, it is. On my last request. Don't make me feel so contradicted. There's no room for cheating and being yourself. Failure leaves such a bitter taster in their mouth</segment3>
		<segment4>And on the last hour. We write so many new chapters again. And on the outside. Where there are no surprises</segment4>
		<segment5>This ground we tread upon. We turn the pages the pages left to right. Is now filling up to our necks. We see everything</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, it's getting longer and longer c'mon. To see it through their eyes. Would bring me so much closer. You can't do this night after night after night. Failure leaves such a bitter taster in my mouth</segment6>
		<segment7>Taste and see, I swear I know what's good. Be still and know that they won't. Lie to you. Every single time. You're facing lies</segment7>
		<segment8>(This ground we tread upon. We turn the pages left to right. Is now filling up to our necks. We see everything) x2</segment8>
		<segment9>(I know why you never take your eyes off me. I've used my lungs for everything but breathing)x2</segment9>
		<segment10>(I find myself dried up in this conversation. So pull me out, pull me aside)x2.     </segment10>
