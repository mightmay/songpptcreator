		<segment1>Bound to learn the hard way. This is the human condition. There is nothing that can be said. To stop us from making mistakes. When I look to myself as a source of ending pain. No matter how many times before I've failed</segment1>
		<segment2>It seems our problems solve themselves. When we look beyond us to those truly in hell</segment2>
		<segment3>The more I focus on myself. Then the more helpless that I become. So why not erase this point of view?. My suffering is trivial. Compared to those who know real agony</segment3>
		<segment4>It seems our problems solve themselves. When we look beyond us to those truly in hell. It seems our problems solve themselves. When we look beyond our suffering</segment4>
		<segment5>My trials seem insignificant now</segment5>
		<segment6>Why won't we look beyond us?. Why won't we look beyond our despair?. It seems our problems solve themselves. When we look to those truly in hell</segment6>
		<segment7>Personal redemption cannot change the world. Unless we lay down our lives for those who still suffer     </segment7>
