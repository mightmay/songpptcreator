		<segment1>I dream it's snowing outside. And it seems it'll never be that time</segment1>
		<segment2>Can't decide to open my eyes. Or to wait 'til light. Don't want to decide to open my eyes. Or to wait 'til light. Tattoed spies, evil lies. That are tied to fright. Don't want to decide to open my eyes. Or to wait 'til light</segment2>
		<segment3>Someday I'll see that no one was there. One day I'll know that I was immature</segment3>
		<segment4>And still there's a fright. And it seems I'll have to sleep with the light</segment4>
		<segment5>Leaving the lights on..    </segment5>
