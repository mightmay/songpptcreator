		<segment1>Im not the same. I have been changed. By the power of Christ. The truth in my life. I cant explain. The difference Hes made. Old things have gone something new has begun</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. This is the day of my salvation. I will rejoice with a song of praise. This is the day of my salvation. I will rejoice in Christ, my salvation</segment2>
		<segment3>Im not the same. I have been changed. The hope that Ive found. Has turned me around. I finally feel. Forgiveness thats real. This thankful heart gets a brand new start</segment3>
		<segment4>[Bridge:]. Come, let us be glad. Come, let us rejoice    </segment4>
