		<segment1>He will be there. Through the hurricane. Through the pouring rain. He will be there. Through the longest night. Everything's gonna be alright. The storm is gonna end. And the sun's gonna rise again</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. Keep on shining. Let Love light up the darkest sky. And you'll be flying. Rise above all the hardest times. So hold on (Hold On). Be strong (Be Strong). Come on (Come on, come on). Keep on shining</segment2>
		<segment3>Nothing can stop. The way He feels. 'Cause His Love's so real. No mountain top. Will ever be too high. 'Cause with Jesus by your side. There's nothing you can't do. You're gonna make it through</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>You know in your soul. You know in your heart. He will always be your only. Guiding star</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]    </segment6>
