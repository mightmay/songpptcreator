		<segment1>I saw this child who never smiled. I told him that's no way to live your life. I saw him kneel down on his knees. As he said please, please, please. It's as if I could see inside his mind. And it reminded me of mine. And it became clear that he belonged here. And he promised me he'd try</segment1>
		<segment2>If only you could have been there. With me and my brother John. We tried so hard not to carry on. But if we're so optimistic well that one he was around. Let me know if you see him around. Let me know if you see him downtown</segment2>
		<segment3>I know there is something better than this. I know there is. There's gotta be. I know there is something better than thisI know there is. There's gotta be</segment3>
		<segment4>I know there. Is a place where I can just hang out. With the friends who I brang out. We can have some laughs smile and drink and have a good time. With all the people we get. Who I could never forget. La la, la la la la la la. Lotsa things that I would like to say. To you in your troubled state. But it's so hard when you're so good at keeping it to yourself. And wait till the sun comes up in the morning. If you come back we'll find a place for you.     </segment4>
