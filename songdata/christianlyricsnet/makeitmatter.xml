		<segment1>Pack my bags and my regrets. Every second that I've wasted. Chasing after. My pursuit of happiness. Has only left me searching. There must be more</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. Take my life and lift me up to the sky. Take my dreams and help me to fly. On the wings of possibility. Come rewrite my history. (till it's) only you I'm chasing after. Take this life and make it matter</segment2>
		<segment3>Help me give more than I take. Let me see into somebody else's heartache. And be the difference love can make. My heart is finally finding. That there is more</segment3>
		<segment4>Only one life to live. Only one love to give. Only one life, only one love. So make it, make it matter</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus].     </segment5>
