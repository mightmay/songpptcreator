		<segment1>By the power of Jesus name. Strongholds break. He's our fortress and our strength. God, we will trust in You</segment1>
		<segment2>Heaven moves and darkness quakes. When we pray. He is strong and He will save. God, we will trust in You</segment2>
		<segment3>Greater is He that lives in us. Than he that is in the world. There is no power strong enough to fear. He is our firm foundation. And our hope has been secured. Greater is He that lives in us. Than he that is in the world</segment3>
		<segment4>Here and now we will proclaim it. Our God saves. Standing firm, we shout our praises. God, we will trust in You. Pressing on to take the promise. We will praise. Nothing here can ever harm us. God we will trust in you</segment4>
		<segment5>Take heart. Our God. Has overcome the world    </segment5>
