		<segment1>Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice. That heartsick look in your eyes. You hide it very well, but I've got the same disguise. I know from all you see around you. You feel worth a very small price. So plain and ordinary, but there's a pearl inside. And if you look in the mirror in the light of the truth. You'll see there's really nothing you could say or do. To make you worth more to the One who made you</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Your are a treasure. Worth more than anything under the sun or the moon. God's greatest treasure. Is the treasure of you. The rich man treasures gold and silver. The wise man, his knowledge of truth. Some will hold to memories and some will cling to youth. But the one who carved out the oceans. And painted the stars in the sky. You are His prized creation, the apple of His eye. There's no one else in the world who could take your place. Just the thought of you brings a smile to His face. God loves you with amazing grace</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE. So take a look in the mirror in the light of the truth. Oh, yes it's true. See there's nothing more you can say or do. God loves the way He created you</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>From the T to the R to the E to the A to the S to the U to the R to the E. God made everything and everything He made. More than anything He treasures you and me. Check in in the mirror in the light of the truth. There is nothing you will ever say and nothing you will do. The will ever make God care more than He does for the treasure. God's treasure is you. .     </segment6>
