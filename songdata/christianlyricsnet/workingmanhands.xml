		<segment1>I guess silence is not an option at this stage. I've been comfortable too long now, turn the page. I see shadows all around me. But to me it's proof of Your light. . Show yourself to me, so I can show you to them. Give me what it takes to let me go.. There's a world out there that's dyin'. . Father please forgive them. For they know not what they do. Father won't You show me how. To have working man hands.. . You said if you love me you'll obey me, I've wondered why. You gave Your life for those around me, so should I. God forbid that I should stand before You. On that day, with unblemished hands. . Show yourself to me, so I can show you to them. Give me what it takes to let me go.. There's a world out there that's dyin'    </segment1>
