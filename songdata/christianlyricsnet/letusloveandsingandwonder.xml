		<segment1>Let us love and sing and wonder. Let us praise the Savior's name. He has hushed the law's loud thunder. He has quenched Mt. Sinai's flame</segment1>
		<segment2>Let us love the Lord who bought us. Pitied us when enemies. Called us by His grace and taught us. Gave us ears and gave us eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>He has washed us with His blood. He has washed us with His blood. He has washed us with His blood. He presents our souls to God</segment3>
		<segment4>Let us wonder grace and justice. Join and point to mercy's store. When through grace in Christ our trust is. Justice smiles and asks no more</segment4>
		<segment5>He who washed us with his blood. He who washed us with his blood. He who washed us with his blood. Has secured our way to God</segment5>
		<segment6>Let us praise and join the chorus. Of the saints enthroned on high. Here they trusted him before us. Now their praises fill the sky</segment6>
		<segment7>He has washed us with his blood. He has washed us with his blood. He has washed us with his blood. He has washed us with his blood. He will bring us home to God</segment7>
		<segment8>Based on a hymn by John Newton (1725-1807)    </segment8>
