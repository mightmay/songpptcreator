		<segment1>Hard times the throw is off line. pictures of black and grey. Soft minds backed up by hard drives. standing in single file. Anything to pass the test. You'll pass the test</segment1>
		<segment2>Like screaming in the air. a sound for all who care. The siren rings in vain. when lightning hits the ground. To all who stand around. a shock of ignorance</segment2>
		<segment3>Black lines can turn to battlefields. when they are drawn in pen. Stop signs like human apathy. can cause a fatal crash. The feeling hard to tell a word. can break the spell</segment3>
		<segment4>Like screaming in the air. a sound for all who care. The siren rings in vain. when lightning hits the ground. To all who stand around. a shock of ignorance</segment4>
		<segment5>The feeling heart to swell. A word can break the spell. Hard times the throw is off line. pictures of black and grey</segment5>
		<segment6>Like screaming in the air. a sound for all who care. The siren rings in vain. when lightning hits the ground. To all who stand around. a shock of ignorance</segment6>
		<segment7>Like screaming in the air. a sound for all who care. The siren rings in vain. when lightning hits the ground. To all who stand around. a shock of ignorance    </segment7>
