		<segment1>I'll tame this lion of flesh before the night is over. My love will not let me rest until my mind is sober. Reputations from my past chained so tight. You break free you break fast on my decision tonight. Formerly known as nothing and and no one. Formerly known as lost. I've been sold to lies I've been told by former generations. Who tell me what's worth having a hold on for cheap sensationss. But you ask me at this moment who I say I am. A new creation they don't have to understand. I will not be bound by what they tell me I can be. I will not stay silent I will speak my liberty    </segment1>
