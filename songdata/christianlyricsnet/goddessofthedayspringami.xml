		<segment1>I have found. Gears under the water. Crossed the streets of Acheron. To the docks that tilted up. Towards the lines. And now I'm. In and out of sleep. Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?. Still I run my hands over your dress. I have found seas under the floorboards. I have stood above the wooden planks. Crossed the wandering walls to find. None of there wars!. Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?. Still I run my hands over your dress. Some of us have seen. The Golden Arrows poised. Arc across the courts. Turns us pale. Have you forgotten me for flowers in your hair?. Still I run my hands over your dress. And our character will never forget what has happened to that city, Pushed down like a strain of sick to the muddy banks..    </segment1>
