		<segment1>So many faces, lost in a sea of envy. Imagine the traces, left by the tears I've cried. Tortured and tempted, never once giving in. Homeless and humble, lacking the will to fight. Empty and aching, walking this path I've chosen. Never mistaking just what this choice will cost me. I stumble and stagger, losing my sense of balance. Broken and beaten, bruised beyond recognition. High above You can see me dancing in the empty night. High above You can reach me. Sraw me up into Your light. Empty and aching, walking this path I've chosen. Never mistaking, just what this choice will cost me. Father forgive them for they know not what they do. Now it is finished I commit my soul to You.     </segment1>
