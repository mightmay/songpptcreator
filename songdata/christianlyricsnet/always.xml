		<segment1>Ill never find the words to say. How beautiful you are, my son. And everyday that this life brings. You have to know how much youre loved </segment1>
		<segment2>Even when Im far away. I will dream of you tonight. I will pray to God to bless your life. Always, always. As you grow and start to change. I will love you just the same. Always, always </segment2>
		<segment3>And when you feel like giving up. I will walk you through the pain. And when you feel like lifes too much. Remember Jesus is your strength </segment3>
		<segment4>Always </segment4>
		<segment5>There will come a day when Ill explain. All the mistakes your dad has made. I hope you see that it was Christ. And only Him that rescued me </segment5>
		<segment6>Even when I fell away.     </segment6>
