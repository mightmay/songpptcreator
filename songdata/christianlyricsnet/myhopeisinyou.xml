		<segment1>I meet with You. And my soul sings out. As Your word throws doubt far away. I sing to You. And my heart cries holy. Hallelujah, Father, You're near </segment1>
		<segment2>My hope is in You, Lord. All the day long. I won't be shaken by drought or storm. A peace that passes understanding is my song. And I sing. My hope is in You alone</segment2>
		<segment3>I wait for You. And my soul finds rest. In my selfishness You show me grace. I worship You. And my heart cries glory. Hallelujah, Father, You're here </segment3>
		<segment4>I will wait on You. You are my refuge    </segment4>
