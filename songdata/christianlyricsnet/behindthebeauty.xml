		<segment1>Does the sunrise somehow give you hope, Does a newborn baby stir something in your soul, And can a melody of a symphony inspire you, Inspire you.</segment1>
		<segment2>Look around, look around, Tell me can you see, All the wonder in the world, Is reason to believe, There is something more, A love we can't ignore, Behind the beauty.</segment2>
		<segment3>Yeah..</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh can you remember your first kiss, Were you nervous and clumsy or was it perfect and innocent, Sometimes the smallest things. Can cause our hearts to sing the loudest, The loudest. Look around, look around, Tell me can you see, All the wonder in the world, Is reason to believe, There is something more, A love we can't ignore, Behind the beauty.</segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah.. Yeah..</segment5>
		<segment6>(Just look.. Around.. rpt)</segment6>
		<segment7>There's a God who made us, There's a God who loves us, And He's speaking to us, to us, There's a God who made us, There's a God who loves us, And He's speaking to us, And it's beautiful.</segment7>
		<segment8>Look around, look around, Tell me can you see, All the wonder in the world, Is reason to believe, There is something more, A love we can't ignore, Yeah there is so much more, A God we can't ignore, Behind the beauty.    </segment8>
