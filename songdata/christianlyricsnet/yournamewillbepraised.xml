		<segment1>From the rising sun. To the end of the day. Your name will be praised, Jesus. Your name will be praised</segment1>
		<segment2>From the prophets of old. To the mouths of babes. Your name will be praised, Jesus. Your name will be praised</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. Glory to You, exalted One. Who gave Your life away. Glory to You, our Risen King. Jesus, Your name will be praised. Your name will be praised</segment3>
		<segment4>For the gift of new life. For your mercy each day. Your name will be praised, Jesus. Your name will be praised</segment4>
		<segment5>Through the darkest of nights. When we cant find our way. We will walk by faith not sight, Lord. Your name will be praised</segment5>
		<segment6>For who You are. For what Youve done. For what Youve yet to do. This song we raise. This day we proclaim, all glory to you?.     </segment6>
