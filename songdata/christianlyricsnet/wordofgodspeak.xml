		<segment1>I'm finding myself at a loss for words. And the funny thing is it's okay. The last thing I need is to be heard. But to hear what You would say</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). Word of God speak. Would You pour down like rain. Washing my eyes to see. Your majesty. To be still and know. That You're in this place. Please let me stay and rest. In Your holiness. Word of God speak</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm finding myself in the midst of You. Beyond the music, beyond the noise. All that I need is to be with You. And in the quiet hear Your voice</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus 2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm finding myself at a loss for words. And the funny thing is it's okay    </segment5>
