		<segment1>i believed in you daddy. but lately it's so hard to keep the faith. i am too rational. to stroll upon the waters. i relied on you. but tonight's rush hour in the sky. i lost your frequency. in a cacophony of prayers. cling to me and i'll cling to you. take me to your greatest height. can you make anything of this. and are you even listening. can you take anymore of this. can i still be forgiven    </segment1>
