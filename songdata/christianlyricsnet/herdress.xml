		<segment1>Theres a kind of way who love it when I fall, loves it when I bleed, loves to take control. Must she look that way, take me to the ground, I become the ground, we become the ground. Her dress becomes my thoughts. Her thoughts become a plot. Her touch becomes my fate. Can mercy find a way?. Can mercy find a way?</segment1>
		<segment2>Find me. An empty me. Well I like you that way. But I cannot stay, Find me. A broken me. Well I like her that way, but I will not stay</segment2>
		<segment3>Theres a certain pain that separates the call, Loves to see me bleed, loves to take control, Must she look that way, take me to the ground, I become the ground, we become the ground. Her dress becomes my thoughts. Her thoughts become a plot. Her touch becomes my fate. Can mercy find a way?. Can mercy find a way?</segment3>
		<segment4>Find me. An empty me. Well I like you that way but I cannot stay, Find me. A broken me. Well I like her that way but I will not stay.</segment4>
		<segment5>Free. Theres a kind of way who love it when I fall. Loves it when I bleed, loves to take control    </segment5>
