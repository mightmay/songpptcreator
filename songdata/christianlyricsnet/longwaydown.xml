		<segment1>Oh, here you are there's nothing left to say. You're not supposed to be that way. Did they push you out. Did they throw you away. Touch me now and I don't care. When you take me I'm not there. Almost human but I'll never be the same. Long way down I don't think I'll make it on my own. Long way down I don't want to live in here alone. Long way down I don't think I'll make it on my own. Never put you down I never pushed you away. You're not supposed to be that way. And anything you want there's nothing I could say. Is there anything to feel. Is it pain that makes you real. Cut me off before it kills me. Long way down I don't think I'll make it on my own. Long way down I don't want to live in here alone. Long way down I don't think I'll make it on my own. I never put you down I never pushed you away. Take another piece of me. Give my mind a new disease. And the black and white world never fades to gray. Long way down I don't think I'll make it on my own. Long way down I don't want to live in here alone. Long way down I don't think I'll make it on my own </segment1>
