		<segment1>You've made the mystery of life quite clear to me. The sparkling truth revealed is so satisfying. This treasure of life that You bring gives me this passion to sing. I need You, I run into Your arms</segment1>
		<segment2>Hope of the world, oh I come to You. Light in the darkness. You're shining Your heart in me</segment2>
		<segment3>I promise, promise, to eternity. I'll live and die to know You, to love You. For I've found what I've been looking for</segment3>
		<segment4>I sense You've known all along this need in me to belong. Your wings of grace completely swept me away. True love is possible I know, just look at me, does it show?. I long for the day that I see You face to face</segment4>
		<segment5>Hope of the world, oh I come to You. Light in the darkness. You're shining Your heart in me</segment5>
