		<segment1>i would give everything. to give nothing more. i would give everything. to give nothing more </segment1>
		<segment2>walk outside you're standing in the rain. eyes collide we both know i'm to blame. see me cry feel like judas for awhile. absolution i'm feeling so tired </segment2>
		<segment3>bygones by you took away the blame. this humanity haunts me. everyday i feel ashamed </segment3>
		<segment4>how long till everything is new. how long till our bodies are renewed. how long till we see you face to face. how long till we reach that perfect place    </segment4>
