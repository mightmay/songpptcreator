		<segment1>Verse 1. I once was fatherless, a stranger with no hope;. Your kindness wakened me, Awakened me, from my sleep.</segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 2. Your love it beckons deeply, A call to come and die. By grace now I will come. And take this life, take your life. </segment2>
		<segment3>Pre-chorus. Sin has lost its power, death has lost its sting. From the grave you've risen. VICTORIOUSLY! </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Into marvelous light I'm running, Out of darkness, out of shame. By the cross you are the truth, You are the life, you are the way.</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 3. My dead heart now is beating, My deepest stains now clean. Your breath fills up my lungs. Now I'm free. Now I'm free! </segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. Lift my hands and spin around, See the light that I have found. Oh the marvelous light. Marvelous light     </segment6>
