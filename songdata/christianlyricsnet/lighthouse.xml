		<segment1>Bouncing like a buoy. Drifting on the water. Singletary solitude man begins to holler. He says, &quot;Man overboard&quot;. I jump ship on the trip. It was a worldwide cruise. Trading riches for some fishes. I've got nothing more to lose. I'm a man overboard. I'm a man overboard </segment1>
		<segment2>If it wasn't for the lighthouse. Where would my life be. On a ship bound for no where. On an unforgiving sea. I thank God. For the light </segment2>
		<segment3>Legs and arms are burning. Swim against the tide. Keep an eye above the water. So I can see the light. I'm a man overboard. I dream about the Savior. I dream about the shore. I feel the sand. You take my hand. And we will walk forevermore. I'm a man overboard. I'm a man overboard </segment3>
		<segment4>If it wasn't for the lighthouse. Where would my life be. On a ship bound for nowhere. On an unforgiving sea. I thank God for the lighthouse. I thank God for the light </segment4>
		<segment5>If it wasn't for the lighthouse. Where would my life be. On a ship bound for nowhere. On an unforgiving sea. I thank God. If it wasn't for the lighthouse. Where would my life be. On a ship bound for nowhere on an unforgiving sea. I thank God for the lighthouse. I thank God for the light    </segment5>
