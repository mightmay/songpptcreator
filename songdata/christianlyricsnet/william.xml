		<segment1>My life's been torn apart, stripped down and going nowhere. I don't know where to start, and where to go from there. It gets tough to follow you where I get scared. That I might take a spill me in faith. We agure a lot. If I will will it be Your will or will it not. God I need You, here I need You now to help me through. I think it's clear You know just how to do what You're gonna do. I am feeling quite content. I will reign in Your testiment. Sure of what I see blind of, my guidence is Your everlasting love. God I need You, here I need You now to help me through. I think it's clear You know just how to do what You're gonna do. Yeah Yeah Yeah.    </segment1>
