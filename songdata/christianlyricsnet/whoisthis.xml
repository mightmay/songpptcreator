		<segment2>Who is this that beckons me. To come close. Beauty beyond words. surrounds me when You're near. You're the Lover of my soul. Draw me unto You. Draw me unto You</segment2>
		<segment3>We will run, we will fly. We will be together. We will laugh, we will cry. We will be together</segment3>
		<segment4>Who is this that wipes the tears. From my eyes. Just one glimpse of. You steals my heart away. You're the Lover of my soul. Draw me unto You. Draw me unto You    </segment4>
