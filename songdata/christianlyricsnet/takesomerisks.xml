		<segment1>Feeling like a ghost in this town. Try to save my place, my head down. trudging on, moving keeps me warm</segment1>
		<segment2>I thought loneliness would beat fear. but they make friends and bring them all here. satisfied, they won't leave tonight</segment2>
		<segment3>everyone gets over this. they move along, they take some risks. all i want comes easily to everyone surrounding me</segment3>
		<segment4>You say I won't be blamed again now. You promise me. I try to cover all the bases. I try but I could not succeed. It's on your face, nothing fell in place</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, I'm just trying to let you know. I could never see it your way. I could never let go. Oh, I could never let go    </segment5>
