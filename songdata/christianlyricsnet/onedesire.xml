		<segment1>You gave it all for me. My soul desire, my everything. And all I am is devoted to You</segment1>
		<segment2>How could I fail to see. You are the love that rescued me. And all I am is devoted to You</segment2>
		<segment3> </segment3>
		<segment4>And oh, how could I not be moved. Lord here with You. So have Your way in me. Cause Lord, there is just one thing. That I will seek</segment4>
		<segment5>This is my cry. My one desire. Is to be where You are, Lord. Now and forever. It's more than a song. My one desire. Is to be with You. Is to be with You, Jesus    </segment5>
