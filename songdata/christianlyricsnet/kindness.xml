		<segment1>Open up the skies of mercy. Rain down your cleansing flood. Healing waters rise around us. Hear our cries, Lord Let 'em rise</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: It's Your kindness Lord that leads us to repentance. Your favor, Lord, is our desire. It's Your beauty, Lord, that makes us stand in silence. Your love, Your love is better than life</segment2>
		<segment3>We can feel Your mercy falling. You are turning our hearts back again. Hear our praises rise to heaven. Draw us near, Lord, meet us here</segment3>
