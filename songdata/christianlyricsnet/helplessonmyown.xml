		<segment1>How could I get by without you?. Why was I depending on myself to get me through?. I really don't deserve a second chance. I know you'll give it to me, all I have to do is ask. Without your mercy I am nothing. Humble me and help me understand your love has always been unending, and I will always love you to the end. How could I forget who you are. and limit you to something less than who you really are?. Placing trust into my own strength has never brought me closer, it just keeps me far away. It seems like every time I try to do things on my own. You let me know that you've got something better for me. In my hardest times I look to you to take control, you're always there. I know that you're right beside me.    </segment1>
