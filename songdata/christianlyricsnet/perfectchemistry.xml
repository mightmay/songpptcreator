		<segment1>I havent reached perfection. But is that what she needs?. I havent reached the wisdom that she should always heed. And I am just a man. I havent died for her, but I would. Ill do whatever I have to</segment1>
		<segment2>I may not be her perfect chemistry, But, if I can love her like You do, thats all she needs</segment2>
		<segment3>I havent found the remedy to every tear shell cry. But Ill try to be the one whos by her side</segment3>
