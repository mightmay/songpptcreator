		<segment1>There's one thing that I ask. Just one thing I seek. To delight myself in you. To live all my days. Announcing your fame. To delight myself in you, in you</segment1>
		<segment2>I just want to sing to you. I just want to life my voice in praise. I just want to worship you. I just want to shout aloud your name. I just want to stand her ein your glory, Lord. And dance in Heaven's light. I just want to sing to you</segment2>
		<segment3>I've only one prayer. And only one plea. To delight myself in you. To spend all my life. Revealing your might. To delight myself in you, in you</segment3>
		<segment4>I lift my eyes to you. I fall on my face. I lift my soul to you. I give all the praise.     </segment4>
