		<segment1>just one of those days the birds were chirping and life was good just another day in the hood and everything was great just one of those days just an average friday night in oc it was concert night so we headed on our way killing time we walked around and grabbed a bite looking forward to the night not knowing what lurked ahead of us pressing forward we set up all our gear not knowing what was near and that's when things got out of control out of control coming out of the blue a skin thought it would be ok to re-arrange my face to look more like his oh it felt so good your warm embrace indenting my face i wish you all could know the touch it's like running a race on fluffy shoes or jumping on your bed i wish for a minute i could be you i would own the universe with one punch i would rule and make this world out of control out of control.     </segment1>
