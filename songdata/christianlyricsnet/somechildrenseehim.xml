		<segment1>Some children see him. Lily white. The baby Jesus. Born this night. Some children see him. Lily white. With tresses soft. And fair</segment1>
		<segment2>Some children see him. Bronzed and brown. The lord of heav'n. To earth come down. Some children see him. Bronzed and brown. With dark and heavy hair</segment2>
		<segment3>Some children see him. Almond-eyed. This savior whom. We kneel beside. Some children see him. Almond-eyed. With skin of yellow hue. Some children see him. Dark as they. Sweet Mary's son. To whom we pray. Some children see him. Dark as they. And, ah. They love him, too</segment3>
		<segment4>The children. In each. Diff'rent place. Will see. The baby Jesus' face. Like theirs. But bright. With heav'nly grace. And filled. With holy light</segment4>
		<segment5>O lay aside. Each earthly thing. And with thy heart. As offering. Come worship now. The infant King. 'Tis love. That's born tonight    </segment5>
