		<segment1>you have always been the best part of me</segment1>
		<segment2>with my uncovered eyes. loose from lenses absorbing light. your hand is wrapped in mine. the sun set for the last time</segment2>
		<segment3>carpet stains from coffee cups. thrown to stop from hurting so much. paralyzed I thought I would fail you somehow. and let you down. but you saved me from death    </segment3>
