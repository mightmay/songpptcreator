		<segment1>Its not everything it seems - the world and its dreams. Slipping like water through my hands tonight. All the things I thought would fill me up inside. Left me empty here - and now I know why</segment1>
		<segment2>All along I was looking for something else. Youre something else. All along I was looking for something more. Youre so much more. I finally found what I could never see before. Youve always been the one that I was looking for </segment2>
		<segment3>All of my castles in the sand - washed away again. And Im left back where I began tonight. The only thing that can ever fill me up. Has been right in front of me all the time</segment3>
		<segment4>bridge: I wont miss you - I wont miss you this time. I say I want you - yeah I want you in my life    </segment4>
