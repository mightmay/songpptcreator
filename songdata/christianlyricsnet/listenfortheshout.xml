		<segment1>Can you feel His power flowin' through your heart - yeah. have you ever wondered if you are apart. signs and times are changin' the world is rearranging. mankind is actin' playing with the flesh</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again. Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again. Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again. Listen for the shout, He's comin' back again</segment2>
		<segment3>Raise your eyes and look around. and pick yourself up off the ground. you can make it and you can win. you have the power through Him. be delighted in the Lord. and He will give you your hearts desire. for when He spoke the world began. it appeared at His command</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>our sins have gone as far away. as what the east is from the west. the wealth and riches of the land. would not even fill His hand. so raise your voice and praise His name. your life will never be the same. I thank the Lord I'm born again. and soon I'll see Him come again</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
