		<segment1>A screaming man falls to his knees. His broken heart, inflicts the pain. He's withdrawn, no one knows his name. One mistake, now he's lost in shame</segment1>
		<segment2>Amidst the pain, you're not alone. Though you can't see through the haze. His eyes of love are staring down. And He feels your troubled heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Yes it's true, that someone cares. Your perfect friend, never leaving you. Strength is gone and you're feeling cold. You will know the truth that He told</segment3>
		<segment4>Amidst the pain, you're not alone. Though you can't see through the haze. His eyes of love are staring down. And He feels your troubled heart</segment4>
		<segment5>By Your grace You repair the broken pieces within. Somehow You take a man and make something more out of him</segment5>
		<segment6>Amidst the pain, you're not alone. Though you can't see through the haze. His eyes of love are staring down. And He feels your troubled heart    </segment6>
