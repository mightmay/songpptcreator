		<segment1>Love comes and it goes. Never stays inside me. Where it can grow. 'Cause I've got a break in my heart. If you could sing a broken hearted song. You know that I'd sing along. 'Cause I've got a break In my heart</segment1>
		<segment2>And everything I try to do. Just falls along the wayside. It turns to dust. It never blooms it never lives. It only dies</segment2>
		<segment3>Where is the mender of broken dreams. Has he given up on me. 'Cause I've got a break in my heart. Who can sing a song of love. And make it stay inside of me. 'Cause I've got a break in my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>And everything I try to do. Just falls along the wayside. It turns to dust. It never blooms it never lives. It only dies</segment4>
		<segment5>Love sang me this song. Now he flows forever through every song. 'Cause I've got a break in my heart. Love is the mender of broken dreams. Now he's able to live through me. 'Cause I've got a break in my heart</segment5>
		<segment6>Now everything I try to do. Just turn to hope when you sing through. The song is love it never hides. It always lives - it never dies</segment6>
		<segment7>Love comes and it goes    </segment7>
