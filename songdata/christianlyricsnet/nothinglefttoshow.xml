		<segment1>Life is just a lineup, tell me when my time's up. Too much on my mind today. There's so much left that I would like to say. When I start to climb up will you pull my line up. Or am I just in the way. I think about it every single day. I think about it every single day</segment1>
		<segment2>Fix us cause we keep falling apart, just keep falling apart. We're tired of being alone. Fix me cause I keep falling apart, just keep falling apart. Would someone find me</segment2>
		<segment3>Life is just a lineup, tell me when my time's up. Too much on my mind today. There's so much left that I would like to say. When I start to climb up will you pull my line up. Or am I just in the way. I think about it every single day. I think about it every single day</segment3>
		<segment4>Fix us cause we keep falling apart, just keep falling apart. We're tired of being alone. Fix me cause I keep falling apart, just keep falling apart. Would someone find me</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I feel like something's goin' on..     </segment5>
