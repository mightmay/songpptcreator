		<segment1>A promise from a. Cardboard box so. Commonly thrown on. The street how easily we. Break apart but we never. Seem to stay that. Way there's something. Inside those jars. Of clay!(2cor.4:16). Outwardly we're wasting. Away inside we're. Renewed day by day it's. Always him it's never me. He is truth why can't you. See? there's something. Inside those jars of clay.    </segment1>
