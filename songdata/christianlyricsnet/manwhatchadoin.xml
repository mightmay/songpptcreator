		<segment1>I heard this guy say once:</segment1>
		<segment2>If I had the money than I'd, Buy all the happiness that money could buy, I'd have 10 stretch limos like a movie star, And a room in my house just for my guitar. And if I had money than I'd, Only wear Sean John, Eat my cereal with Grey Poupon, In a swimming pool about one mile long, With speakers underwater, Playing this song</segment2>
		<segment3>Man, whatcha doin?. Don't ya know that, money can't. Buy you love? It can't make you happy, Happy like, havin' someone to laugh with. Man whatcha doin?. Don't cha know that, money can't make it right, You need to love yourself my man, Before you love somebody else</segment3>
		<segment4>Man, sit down, and listen to me for a second, I'm not tryin' to be the sound of a broken record, But every day you live your life, thinkin' this is. All there is, your cheatin' yourself outta. Somethin' special.. no doubt.. </segment4>
		<segment5>He said:</segment5>
		<segment6>If I had the money than I'd, Buy all the happiness that money could buy, I'd have 10 stretch limos like a movie star, And a room in my house just for my guitar. And if I had money than I'd, Only wear Sean John, Eat my cereal with Louie Vuitton, In a swimming pool about one mile long, With speakers underwater, Playing this song</segment6>
		<segment7>Man, whatcha doin?. Don't ya know that, money can't. Buy you love? It can't make you happy, Happy like, havin' someone to laugh with. Man whatcha doin?. Don't cha know that, money can't make it right, You need to love yourself my man, Before you love somebody else    </segment7>
