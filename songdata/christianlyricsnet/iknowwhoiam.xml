		<segment1>I try so hard but I always fall short. . So I've Faced the truth of my weakness. . There's nothing good that I can bring forth, but I stand in the strength of Your presence. . I've wasted time always trying to face hings alone, but I wait here now and I lay it all down. . . I Know Who I Am and I know I'm not able to stand on my own. . I can't live all alone. . So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out. . And I fall down, I fall down for you. . And I fall down. . . In times f brokenness always You show the depth of love that You bring me. . I'm kneeling down in Your presence I know. . Your source of life I'm receiving. . I place myself in Your arms that will always lead me. . And I won't let go caue there's nowhere else to go. . . I don't know why the things I want to do I always ran from now, . Because I know apart from You there's nothing I can do where life will become new. . And I know who I am and I know I'm not able to stand on my own. . I can't live all alone. . So I'm taking my hands and I'm reaching them out, and I know that I'll take everything that's in me. . And I fall down, I fall down for you. And I fall down for you.      </segment1>
