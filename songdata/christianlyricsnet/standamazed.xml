		<segment1>I don't really know how long forever is. But that's how long I'm gonna give my life. Everything I face that tries to tear me down. No I won't back away from the sacrifice</segment1>
		<segment2>I won't forget what your love means to me. You're always there to light my way</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: When all the lights go down and the world is quiet, no one is around. I wanna be the same man that I served you then like I serve you now. Let my convictions never change. Oh let my knee for you remain. As real as the moment I was saved. So I will always stand amazed</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes my heart desires such selfish things. When the moment comes help me to trust. Something better that you have for me. If I could just hold on to you enough. I won't forget what your love means to me. You're always there to light my way</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>You will be my strength when I am weak. When I wanna give in and not turn the other cheek. Oh let this be the prayer that I speak. That I speak</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus     </segment7>
