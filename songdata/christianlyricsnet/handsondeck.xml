		<segment1>All hands on deck don't abandon the ship. You'll never know what it could have been. All hands on deck my ship is sinking. Don't let me go, Don't let me drown</segment1>
		<segment2>A step to the right to your own rhythm. cause what comes next is up to you. I need a miracle to save me from this. I need the angels to all pray for me. I can't believe you</segment2>
		<segment3>Another day another worry. Breaks right through. And indecision bleeds me dry. She's turning pages I'm not making for her. She's in pictures without me in mind. I can't believe you</segment3>
		<segment4>The long walks on Moon Light beach. The promises you could not keep. They're so contagious, You're so contagious. For all the world we did not see. For all the smiles you gave to me. They're so contagious, So very fake</segment4>
		<segment5>And Goodbye to you, Goodbye to you. And Goodbye to you, Goodbye to you</segment5>
		<segment6>    </segment6>
