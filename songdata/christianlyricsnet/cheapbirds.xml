		<segment1>You do not need to fear tomorrow. Would you still remember please. That God must keep track of sparrows. And there's so many ravens GodÂ’s got to feed. But if God takes care of bluebirds. He'll bless you and me the same. Cause I'm not cheap like a bird now. And I'm born for better things. And I'm worth more than odd change. And I'm worth more than I think. The Lord knows everything. I find faith from listenin' to Jesus -- yeah, yeah. When nervous feelings I can't shake. So please don't take this for granted. Cause the Lord knows all your needs. But this Bible states here in Luke 12. He'll get food for me today. Cause I'm not cheap like a bird now. And I'm born for better things. And I'm worth more than odd change. And I'm worth more than I think. The Lord knows everything. The Lord helps me -- find the way. Oh, night and day. The Lord provides -- for cheap birds, yeah    </segment1>
