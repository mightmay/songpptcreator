		<segment1>In this life with these, with these eyes of mine, I seek your face. In this night, in the darkened night, I seek your face. And I'm lost in a moment. I don't know which way to go, fearing the future that's in front of me. Lost in a moment, I stand at the edge and stare stoned by the silence in my mind. Where is the faith, where is the confidence I used to know?. It's nowhere in sight, lost with the dreams of my youth. In this life with these, with these eyes of mine I seek your face.     </segment1>
