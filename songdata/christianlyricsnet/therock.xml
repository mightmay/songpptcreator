		<segment1>Every time I come back to this rock, You've reminded me that I am not alone, That I will never be alone. And when I turn to see that the tides have changed, That people change, and I am not the same, No I will never be the same.</segment1>
		<segment2>Hey did you know, that you fed my soul, The day that you opened up to me. And I just couldn't be still, and tie down my will, I just wanted to run with you, with you.</segment2>
		<segment3>And I thank my God every time I remember you. And I thank my God every time I remember you.</segment3>
		<segment4>And when I start to think about you and me and how we came to be, I start to think about time and how we made it through fine. And then I turn to see that the times have changed, That people change and I am not the same, No I will never be the same.</segment4>
		<segment5>Hey did you know, that you fed my soul, The day that you opened up to me. And I just couldn't be still and tie down my will, I just wanted to run with you, with you.</segment5>
		<segment6>And I thank my God every time I remember you. And I thank my God every time I remember you. I remember you, yes I remember you.</segment6>
		<segment7>Yes I thank my God every time I remember you. And I thank my God every time I remember you. And I thank my God every time I remember you. And I thank my God every time I remember you. I remember you, yes I remember you. I remember you, I remember you.</segment7>
		<segment8>Ever since you stepped foot on this rock, You know it doesn't really matter how you came, We will never be the same.    </segment8>
