		<segment1>Sometimes His eyes were gentle. And filled with laughter. And sometimes they cried. Sometimes there was a fire. Of holy anger. In Jesus eyes. But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless. That saw through the fault to the need. Are the same eyes that look down from heaven. Into the deepest part of you and me</segment1>
		<segment2>His eyes are always upon us. His eyes never close in sleep. And no matter where you go. You will always be in His eyes, in His eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes His voice comes calling. Like rolling thunder. Or like driving rain. And sometimes His voice is quiet. And we start to wonder. If He knows our pain. But He who spoke peace to the water. Cares more for our hearts than the waves. And the voice that once said, Youre forgiven. Still says, Youre forgiven, today</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometime I look above me when starts are shining. And I feel so small. How could the God of heaven and all creation. Know Im hear at all. But then in the silence He whispers. My child, I created you too. And youre my most precious creation. I even gave my Son for you</segment4>
		<segment5>And His eyes are always upon us. His eyes never close in sleep. And no matter where you go. You will always be. You will always be in His eyes. No matter where you go. You will always be in His eyes. Sometimes His eyes were gentle. And filled with laughter.     </segment5>
