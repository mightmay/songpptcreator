		<segment1>I see frustration upon your face. Tired eyes. Won't you just rest with me. I'll make you complete again. I saw the beauty in your soul. The way you are. Can't you just see the moon smiling at you tonight. And what will define you?</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm overjoyed yeah. Overjoyed to be with you. Overcame doubts. Overcame and fell for you</segment2>
		<segment3>I see two roads ahead of you. One is wide, the other is narrow and long. Which is the one you'll choose?. Together we're walking side by side. I will fall and you will rescue me. through all my darkest times. And what will define you?</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause I want to know you. I want to give you all I can. I want to know you. I want to someday understand</segment4>
		<segment5>And its all for you. Yeah, who you going to be, who you going to be?. Always there through the rough times. And you're always there when no one else cares, no one else cares. Always there</segment5>
