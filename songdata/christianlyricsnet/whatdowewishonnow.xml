		<segment1>So many words, so many lies. Funny now there's nothing left to say. We had our share of days in the sun. But we let the clouds get in the way. Who knew how high we could climb. Til we got to the top and we saw how far we could fall?. Now that you're gone, it's all I can do. To keep from losing it all Tell me, what do we wish on now</segment1>
		<segment2>Now that our star has fallen from the sky?. Where did we go so wrong in this love. And how do I kiss you goodbye?. Letters and cards, pictures of you. I never thought they would look so old. Must have been fools, we had it all. But it fell apart when our love grew cold. Standing with you in the rain. Only now in the end can we drop</segment2>
		<segment3>our guard and be real Wishing you well, watching you go. I don't know how I should feel. Cause lately my heart keeps telling me to run to you. I still can't believe that you're gone. But, baby, my mind keeps telling me that we are through. And telling my heart to move on    </segment3>
