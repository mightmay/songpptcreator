		<segment1>'ll ring your doorbell. Until you let me in. And I can no longer tell. Where 'you' end and 'I' begin</segment1>
		<segment2>Grape on the vine. We've been alone a long time. Grape on the vine. Why not be crushed to make wine?</segment2>
		<segment3>Pay no attention to me. Dancing with my girl. We have every intention to be. Failures in this world</segment3>
		<segment4>Grape on the vine. We've been alone a long time. Grape on the vine. Why not be crushed to make wine?</segment4>
		<segment5>Six of my closest friends. Will dig up the ground. All my accomplishments. Gently lowered down</segment5>
		<segment6>Grape on the vine. We've been alone a long time. Grape on the vine. Why not be crushed to make wine?</segment6>
		<segment7>(All is the same to the souls of those so much resigned)</segment7>
		<segment8>The son of the widow. You raised from the dead. Where did his soul go. When he died again?    </segment8>
