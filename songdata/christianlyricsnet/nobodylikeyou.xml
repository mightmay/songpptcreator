		<segment1>I'd like to take just a minute or two. To let you know what I think about you. I've seen so much in this short lifetime of mine. But I've never seen nothing like you</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, there's nobody like you. There's just nobody loves me like you do. You know how many places. I've searched for true love. But there?s just nobody like. There?s just nobody. There?s just nobody. There?s just nobody like you</segment2>
		<segment3>It's so good to walk now in the light of your grace. When the darkness is falling and I feel so out of place. I just turn to you and I find you're all that I need. As long as I know you?re still standing by me    </segment3>
