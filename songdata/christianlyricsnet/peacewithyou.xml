		<segment1>Chorus: It's nice to be at peace with You. It's fine with me to be close to You</segment1>
		<segment2>My eyes are fixed on You, oh Lord. I see You, I see You. My hands are clean. My heart is pure. You washed me, thank You</segment2>
		<segment3>I used to be attracted to. The things of this world. And I used to be at war with You. Now I'm fighting on Your side</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>My love for You is unashamed. I love You, I love You. My guilt is gone, I'm free to fly. Inside, inside</segment5>
		<segment6>I used to be entangled by. The things of this world. And I used to seem so far from You. Now I feel You by my side    </segment6>
