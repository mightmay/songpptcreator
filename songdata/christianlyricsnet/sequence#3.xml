		<segment1>I never truly lived until I died with You. I never truly lived until I died with You</segment1>
		<segment2>You came and changed my life. You came to save my life. You turned Your ear and You heard me (Psalm 116:1,2). Why cant I feel what I believe?</segment2>
		<segment3>Veni sancte Spirtus. Veni sancte Spirtus?</segment3>
		<segment4>You came and changed my life. You came and saved my life. What can I sing to give you my heart. To give up the things that tear us apart</segment4>
		<segment5>Who am I that You died for me. Touched my lips and let me sing. Simple words for simple truth. I never lived till I died with. You</segment5>
		<segment6>I almost forgot. Youre my one, Youre my one good thing (Psalm 16:2). Youre my reason, My reason to sing</segment6>
