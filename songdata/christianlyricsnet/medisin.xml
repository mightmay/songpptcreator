		<segment1>What great risk to truly live, We could die alone. Self proclaimed meaning of bliss, Is getting what we're owed. It's always getting what we're owed.</segment1>
		<segment2>I am like a machine, All that I really need is medicine, And then I'll fall fast asleep. In my dream like state, I'll pretend I'm unscathed. But when i wake my resilience fades. When I wake up my resilience fades.</segment2>
		<segment3>How long? How long?. How long, long?. I know there's more to life than slavery, I'm tired of dying. I know there's more to life than drinking, The soul sick medicine.</segment3>
		<segment4>. Oh no, no. I'll never listen or do what I'm told. At 24 you'd think I'd hold my speech, Instead of mix you a cocktail, Some truth and some slander, And never practice what i preach, And never practice what i preach.</segment4>
		<segment5>How long? How long?. How long, long?. I know there's more to life than slavery, I'm tired of dying. I know there's more to life than drinking, The soul sick medicine.</segment5>
		<segment6>I know there's more to life than slavery, I'm tired of dying. I know there's more to life than drinking, The soul sick medicine.    </segment6>
