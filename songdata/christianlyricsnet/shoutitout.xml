		<segment1>THIS IS THE TIME, THIS IS THE PLACE. WITH OUTSTRECTHED ARMS WE SEEK YOUR FACE. WE SURRENDER ALL TO YOU, SURRENDER ALL TO YOU. SHOUT IT OUT, SHOUT IT OUT WE WILL LIFT YOUR NAME. SHOUT IT OUT, SHOUT IT OUT, YOUR LOVE STILL REMAINS THE SAME, WE'RE SINGING. LET IT OUT, LET IT OUT, WE WILL SING YOUR PRAISE. LET IT OUT, LET IT OUT, COZ WE CANT CONTAIN THE WAY WE FEEL ABOUT YOU. WE ONCE WERE LOST AND OUT OF PLACE, BUT BY YOUR BLOOD OUR SINS ERASED. GLORY TO THE LORD ON HIGH, FOREVER KING OF MINE. GLORY TO THE LORD ON HIGH, FOREVER KING OF LIGHTS. GLORY TO THE LORD ON HIGH, FOREVER GLORIFIED. GLORY TO THE LORD ON HIGH, FOREVER GLORIFIED.    </segment1>
