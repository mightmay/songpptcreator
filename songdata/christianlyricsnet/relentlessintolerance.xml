		<segment1>These eyes, they will gaze and reflect. And gauge every thought I reject. No sway of stance in changing times. Just a narrow mind commanding respect. We stand on the words of the wise. And languish every call to despise. We know the hollow wound of their lies </segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-chorus]. No reformed edition. Never losing vision. Now into forever. Only getting better. Ways of now, spiral down. How much more we allow </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Keeping sight of the vow we made. Holding fast to the hope. So when we stand in the line of wrath. The true and righteous will know </segment3>
		<segment4>The foundation that we used to uphold. Now regarded as the madness of old. Every alteration made to the standard of truth. Is a nail in the coffin we hold. We embody everything they despise. Because they see us through degenerated eyes. So when they cast you down as intolerant filth. Stand firm, never bow to the lies </segment4>
		<segment5>[Pre-chorus] </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>See the scorn inside my eyes </segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus] </segment8>
		<segment9>. .     </segment9>
