		<segment1>Sometimes You're barely touching my fingers. You leave me hanging on for days and. I don't know if I can be Your son. I don't know if I can be Your son</segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes I lie asleep Your shelter. So tightly You embrace my heart and. I don't know if I can bear this loe. I don't know if I can bear this love</segment2>
		<segment3>You promised paradise that day. I took Your hand You took my pain away. Whatever I feel You're still the same. The only name above all names</segment3>
		<segment4>Won't You be my only one. Won't You be my only one. Won't You be my only one. Won't You be my only one</segment4>
		<segment5>You turned my scars into medals. You turned my tears into wine. And I don't know if I can drink this cup. I don't know if I can drink this cup</segment5>
		<segment6>Before the foundation of the world. And way beyond the end to come. You're shining brighter than the sun. You'll always be the only one    </segment6>
