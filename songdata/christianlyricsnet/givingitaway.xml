		<segment1>By the way you brought me here, it makes believe the best is yet to come and I don't want to leave. Forgive my hesitation but I'm learning to trust in you. Help me to dream these dreams because I don't have a clue.</segment1>
		<segment2>If you'de be honest and say what you mean. you know I would promise I'de do anything. because I know that without you I'm giving it away.</segment2>
		<segment3>If this what you wanted?. Cause I'm willing to change. Now that I'm certain, there's so much more to gain. You've introduced me to the moment. but I'm looking to stay for good. You asked me to stay forever. Well, you know that I would, I would do anything.</segment3>
		<segment4>The nights are forever and maybe I'm wrong, but it feels like I'm so lost without you. So I step towards the heat, it's the way I can see, and it makes me believe that it's you.</segment4>
		<segment5>By the way you brought me here. it makes me believe the best is yet to come. and I don't want to leave, I won't, but anyway..</segment5>
		<segment6>The nights are forever, I can't get to sleep cause I know there's a reason. I'm in this too deep. and I'm not sure that without you, I'm giving it away. Yeah.</segment6>
		<segment7>Giving it away..     </segment7>
