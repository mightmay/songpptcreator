		<segment1>What if I'm not the same?. What if I never let go of the blame?. What if you drag me back again?. What if I won't let you just pretend</segment1>
		<segment2>I erase this memory. I escape this gravity. Is that how I used to be?. Is that the price of my identity?</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm standing on the outside. I'm looking in on what you can't hide. I'm dying on the inside. 'Cause now I can see your lies from the outside</segment3>
		<segment4>What if I'm still ashamed?. What if I can't let go of the pain?. What if I have something to lose?. What if I've got nothing left to prove?</segment4>
		<segment5>I replace this life you stole. I embrace the world I know. What if you were always wrong?. What if I said I knew it all along?</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm not you. I will never be you. I won't let you pull me through    </segment6>
