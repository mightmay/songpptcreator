		<segment1>Oh what I would do to have. The kind of faith it takes. To climb out of this boat I'm in. Onto the crashing waves</segment1>
		<segment2>To step out of my comfort zone. Into the realm of the unknown where Jesus is. And He's holding out His hand</segment2>
		<segment3>But the waves are calling out my name. And they laugh at me. Reminding me of all the times. I've tried before and failed. The waves they keep on telling me. Time and time again. &quot;Boy, you'll never win!&quot;. &quot;You'll never win!&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: But the voice of truth tells me a different story. The voice of truth says, &quot;Do not be afraid!&quot;. The voice of truth says, &quot;This is for My glory&quot;. Out of all the voices calling out to me. I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh what I would do to have. The kind of strength it takes to stand before a giant. With just a sling and a stone. Surrounded by the sound of a thousand warriors. Shaking in their armor. Wishing they'd have had the strength to stand</segment5>
		<segment6>But the giant's calling out my name. And he laughs at me. Reminding me of all the times. I've tried before and failed. The giant keeps on telling me. Time and time again. &quot;Boy you'll never win!&quot;. &quot;You'll never win!&quot;</segment6>
		<segment7>But the stone was just the right size. To put the giant on the ground. And the waves they don't seem so high. From on top of them lookin' down. I will soar with the wings of eagles. When  I stop and listen to the sound of Jesus. Singing over me</segment7>
		<segment8>I will choose to listen and believe the voice of truth    </segment8>
