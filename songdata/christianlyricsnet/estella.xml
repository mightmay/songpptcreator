		<segment1>Estella steps in silence. Her every movement caught. Encased in gilded memory. Here it comes again. Anticipation racing through me. Thrilling with emotion. You still me</segment1>
		<segment2>Estella, Estella you. You're missing all you see. I'm missing you. Estella, Estella you dream. You're missing all you see. I'm missing you</segment2>
		<segment3>Estella moves in shadows. Her every whisper caught. Exhale and draw it in again. When everything gets lost. In the twilight, I'll be waiting. You keep me guessing. You enigma, you dream</segment3>
		<segment4>Estella, Estella you. You're missing all you see. I'm missing you. Estella, Estella you dream. You're missing all you see. I'm missing you, my sweet</segment4>
		<segment5>Wide-eyed, weak-kneed. Stare me through my soul. You pierce me. I know we need. Nothing short of holding nothing back. Come down to me. And I'll show you. You mean worlds to me. You do</segment5>
		<segment6>Fare thee well, my love. The last time in a whisper. She whispered back. Fare thee well, my love. Believe me when I say. I love you madly, deeply, always</segment6>
		<segment7>Estella, Estella you. You're missing all you see. I'm missing you. Estella, Estella you dream. You're missing all you see. I'm missing you.     </segment7>
