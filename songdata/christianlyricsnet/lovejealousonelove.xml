		<segment1>this is me at my darkest. looking down from my tower to heaven. my reputation is what I am on the scale. in the eyes of mankind. the more I get beneath me, the higher, and more out of reach. teacher, which of us will be the greatest</segment1>
		<segment2>we will wear compassion. we will wear it on our chests. and sing with love at our throats. like a child, it's all I know</segment2>
		<segment3>Father, hide our hearts in you. lest we steal them back. and lay them at the feet of men. I know now that glory has not a place. near my hands or any man    </segment3>
