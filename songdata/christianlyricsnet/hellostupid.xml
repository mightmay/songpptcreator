		<segment1>I think I'm going to lose my mind. If I screw up just one more time. But as long as you're with me. I'll be alright. Seems like I get dumber everyday. Don't you wish that I'd just go away. Sometimes I don't know why. But I know you're always there. I hope it never seems that I do not care for you. You know it's true. I'll always be running after you and. When you call me out I want to be there. I've always wanted. I've always wanted this. Open up my eyes. I wanna see your face. Cuz I know you'll be there. When others fade. No matter what the time. You've always been with me.     </segment1>
