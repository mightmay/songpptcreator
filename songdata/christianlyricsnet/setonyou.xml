		<segment1>Just try to follow me. Cause I got something that I wanna say. And I know it sounds crazy. But I'm gonna tell you anyway. When I close my eyes lately I'm so far from sleep</segment1>
		<segment2>As I lie mostly awake. You're always on my mind for as long as a night takes. Through the dark I toss and turn with you it's all I can do. I've got my heart set on you</segment2>
		<segment3>We're living out our destiny. God had plans for you and me. Way before eternity began. Sure as an age old burning fire. Your gonna see my hearts desire. Has found it's way to you. Where it belongs</segment3>
		<segment4>So as time goes by. As long as I'm with you. You'll know the reason why. Finding as I'm growing old with you. There's a love still brand-new. Cause I've got my heart set on you    </segment4>
