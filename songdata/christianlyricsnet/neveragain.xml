		<segment1>The sun was rising in the sky just like the day before. Just another normal day not knowing what's in store. Naturally you found a way to creep into my mind. You're whispering, I'm listening. How'd you get inside Listen up, I've heard about enough. That's right, I've turned my life. around Never, oh no, never again</segment1>
		<segment2>Will I fall for your schemes. Will I fall for your plan. Never, oh no, I won't give in. This game's gotta end. Cause I'm not turning back. Never again I was not a stranger. to the lies that you had told. I have been in danger of desires taking over. Everything that I believe and all I know is true. Hypnotized, compromised, all because. of you Listen up, I've heard about enough. Sick of the lies you told me</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't you know I've turned my life. around Never want to see your face. Sick of being in this place. Why can't I just live without you on my. mind You were mesmerizing, I thought. Now I see through all the lies I bought    </segment3>
