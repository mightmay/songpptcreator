		<segment1>Living on my own, thinking for myself. Castles in the sand, temporary wealth. Now the walls are falling down. Now the storms are closing in. And here I am again</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, hold me now. I need to feel You in this place. To know Youre by my side. And hear Your voice tonight. Jesus, hold me now. I long for Your embrace. Im beat and broken down. I cant find my way out. Jesus, hold me now</segment2>
		<segment3>Curse this morning sun, drags me into one more day. Of reaping what Ive sown, living with my shame. Welcome to my world, and the life that I have made. One day youre a prince, and the next day youre a slave</segment3>
		<segment4>Lord, I just looked up today. And realized how far away I am from where You are. I dont know what else to pray. Broken at Your feet I lay. The life Ive torn apart</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus, hold me now. Jesus, hold me now. Jesus, hold me now. Jesus, hold me now </segment5>
