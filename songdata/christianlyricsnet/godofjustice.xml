		<segment1>God of Justice, Saviour to all. Came to rescue the weak and the poor. Chose to serve and not be served</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, You have called us. Freely we've received. Now freely we will give</segment2>
		<segment3>We must go live to feed the hungry. Stand beside the broken. We must go. Stepping forward keep us from just singing. Move us into action. We must go</segment3>
		<segment4>To act justly everyday. Loving mercy in everyway. Walking humbly before You God</segment4>
		<segment5>You have shown us, what You require. Freely we've received. Now freely we will give</segment5>
		<segment6>. Fill us up and send us out. Fill us up and send us out. Fill us up and send us out Lord    </segment6>
