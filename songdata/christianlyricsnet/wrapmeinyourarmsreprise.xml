		<segment1>Wrap me in your arms. William McDowell. There is a God who loves me. Who wraps me in His arms. That is the place where Im changed. And thats where I belong. Take me to that place Lord. To that secret place where. I can be with you. You can make me like you. Wrap me in your arms. Wrap me in your arms. Wrap me in your arms    </segment1>
