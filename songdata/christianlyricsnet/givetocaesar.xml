		<segment1>We have lost ourselves to their game. Everyday it's always the same, I see the truth and it's slipping away. It's time we learn how to separate. We have to separate and give it away, Unlearn the prophecy that we no longer have to pray, to you. We need a fire in our hearts, we need renewal for our souls. We have lost ourselves to our game. It's time we rejoice in giving away, alive in Christ we know he's the way, we all know today is the day. We have to separate and give it away, Unlearn the prophecy that we no longer have to pray, to you. Give to Caesar what is his. Give to Jesus all you are    </segment1>
