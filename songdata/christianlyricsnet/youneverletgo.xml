		<segment1>Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, Your perfect love is casting out fear. And even when I'm caught in the middle of the storms of this life, I won't turn back, I know You are near.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I will fear no ev - il, For my God is wi - th me. And if my God is wi - th me, Whom then shall I fear? Whom then shall I fear?</segment2>
		<segment3>O no, You never let go through the calm and through the storm. O no, You never let go in every high and every low. O no, You never let go. Lord, You never let go of me. And I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on. A glorious light beyond all compare. And there will be an end to these troubles, But until that day comes, We'll live to know You here on the earth.</segment3>
		<segment4>Yes, I can see a light that is coming for the heart that holds on, There will be an end to these troubles, but until that day comes, Still I will praise You, Still I will praise You.    </segment4>
