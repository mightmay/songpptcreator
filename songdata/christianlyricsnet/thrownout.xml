		<segment1>Walk away from me. You don't want to hear what I have to say. Say it is a lie. But why are you so afraid of what you don't believe?. I don't want to preach at you. I just want a chance to speak my mind. Say what I have to say, I won't sell out what I believe. Hear what you want, ignoring all the facts. God's not about the labels that you attach. Homophobia and sexism is not what we are about. If only you'd understand all flasehood could be thrown out. Falsehoods could be thrown out.    </segment1>
