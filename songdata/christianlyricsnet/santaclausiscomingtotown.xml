		<segment1>Oh! You better watch out. You better not cry. You better not pout. I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town</segment1>
		<segment2>He's making a list. Checking it twice. Gonna find out who's naughty or nice. Santa Claus is coming to town!</segment2>
		<segment3>He sees you when you're sleeping. He knows when you're awake. He knows if you've been bad or good. So be good for goodness sake</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh! You better watch out. You better not cry. You better not pout. I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!    </segment4>
