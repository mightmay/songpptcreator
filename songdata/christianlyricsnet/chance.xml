		<segment1>There's really no reason for you to cry tonight, But if the tears just won't stop coming, please know, That although you've heard this too many times before. He's feeling every second of your brokenness</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't just get use to the sadness, and not bother to fight. It's like you're painting these rainbows black and white. You're giving up way too fast, Won't you give him a chance to change your mind, and heal your life.</segment2>
		<segment3>I know you want out so bad, but there's no more remedy. You've already sunk into the deepest of seas. In surrender you throw your hands up in the air. But giving in to the wrong thing, the wrong thing. There's no closing the door, when everything inside is screaming for more.     </segment3>
