		<segment1>We laughed out loud til we cried. And the tears were sweet. Midnight melted to morning. A moment faded to memory. All these days. They just slip away through our fingers. So</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Don't let go. Hold onto every moment. Always know. Hold onto every moment that You can</segment2>
		<segment3>We move on with no regrets to our destiny. Held by the hands of the Father. We share His love and He leads us through. All these days. They just slip away through our fingers. So</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Running through yesterday into tomorrow. Don't let it just drift away. Forget about tying the hands of time. Give every minute to the One who gave us today</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
