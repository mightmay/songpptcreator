		<segment1>Hold the milk, put back the sugar. They are powerless to console. WE've gathered here to sprinkle ashes. from our late friend's cereal bowl. Breakfast Clubbers, say the motto. that he taught us to repeat;. &quot;You will lose it in your gym class. if you wait 'till noon to eat.&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>Back when the Chess Club said our eggs were soft. every Monday he'd say grace and hold our juice aloft. Oh, none of us knew his checkout time would come so soon. But before his brain stopped waving, he composed this tune: </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: When the toast is burned. and all the milk has turned. and captain crunch is waving farewell. When the big one finds you. may this song remind you. that they don't serve breakfast in hell </segment3>
		<segment4>Breakfast clubbers, drop the hankies. Though to some our friend was odd, that day he bought those pine pajamas. his check was good with God. </segment4>
		<segment5>Those here without the Lord, how do you cope?. For this morning we don't mourn. like those who have no hope </segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, rise up, Fruit Loop lovers -. sing out sweet &amp; low. With spoons held high. we bid our brother, &quot;Cheerio!&quot; </segment6>
		<segment7>When the toast is burned. and all the milk has turned. and captain crunch is waving farewell. When the big one finds you. may this song remind you. that they don't serve breakfast in hell </segment7>
		<segment8>Repeat Chorus.     </segment8>
