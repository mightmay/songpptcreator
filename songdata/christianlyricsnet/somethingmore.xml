		<segment1>I've spent half my lifetime. watching time go by. And wonderin' where it went. And when I try to fall asleep at night. I lay there feeling spent. Contemplating what the next day's. Gonna hold for me. Tossing, turning. My mind is churning. thoughts won't let me be. Every morning meets me. With a list of all I have to do. And every evening greets me. With the knowledge that I'm never through. And every taste of success. Makes me vow to never fail. Feels like I just chase my tail</segment1>
		<segment2>*chorus*. There's gotta be something more. Than running circles for a living. Gotta be something better. Than just trying to survive. Gotta some more important piece. That I am missing. Gotta be something more to life</segment2>
		<segment3>If every picture tells a story. Mine must be a mystery. Cuz I lose sight of who I am. And who I am supposed to be. looking back at what I've built. and all that I've acheived. only leads me to believe. yeah</segment3>
		<segment4>*chorus*</segment4>
		<segment5>tired of these hopeless places. bored with my earthly things. so i must fill my empty spaces. with the love that heaven brings</segment5>
		<segment6>*chorus 2x    </segment6>
