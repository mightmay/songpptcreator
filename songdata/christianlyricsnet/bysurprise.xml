		<segment1>I've got a secret to tell. A midnight confession. I love the life that I lead. But it's no obsession</segment1>
		<segment2>Because I'm waiting, anticipating. Watching for Your return. You'll come and get me. You know I'm ready. Enjoyed my stay, but You'll steal me away</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Like a thief in the night. Like a runaway train. Like a first class, lightning fast hurricane. I'll keep my ear to the ground. And my eyes to the sky. I'm ready now but somehow. I know You'll take me by surprise</segment3>
		<segment4>So I'll keep spreading the word. To everybody. Until the masses have heard. About that party</segment4>
		<segment5>Because I'm waiting, anticipating. Watching for Your return. You'll come and get me. You know I'm ready. Enjoyed my stay, but You'll steal me away</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>Cause I R.S.V.P.'d on the invitation. I sent it care of the blood. That saved me the spot. With the One who will come</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS    </segment8>
