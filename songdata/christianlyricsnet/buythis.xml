		<segment1>Don't you know your chains are growing old. You've dragged them here to bury all you know. The past has fallen but the fear is holding on. And the taste of the moment or feeling all alone. What will it be chains again or free?</segment1>
		<segment2>You don't have to buy this. You don't have to be. You don't have to believe the lies of all the enemies. I know the cost to compromise. Is hard enough to see. You don't have to buy this. You have been set free</segment2>
		<segment3>Those three words are too unknown. But they've been lost in the halls of our homes. Mothers, daughters will forfeit her soul. For the taste of the moment. And the fear of being alone</segment3>
		<segment4>You don't have to buy this. You don't have to be. You don't have to believe the lies. Of all our enemies. I know the cost to compromise. Is hard enough to see. You don't have to buy this</segment4>
		<segment5>You don't have to believe the lies. That hold you blind and take you down. And leave you dry. The promises that always fail. The damage in your eyes. The countless calls to compromise. That hold you here in this disguise. The years that you've been wasting inside. You didn't have to buy</segment5>
		<segment6>No, you don't have to buy this. You don't have to be. You don't have to believe the lies. Of all our enemies. I know the cost to compromise. Is hard enough to see. But, you don't have to buy this. You have been set free. You have been set free</segment6>
		<segment7>There is still a promise. There is yet a kiss. There is still a story. It doesn't end like this    </segment7>
