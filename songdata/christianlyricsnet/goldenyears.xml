		<segment1>come with me to the summer of 49 when i saw her i told her that forever she'd be mine we shared some laughs we shared some tears we talked about our deepest fears the two of us left the world behind we packed our bags and hitched a ride scared to death we went inside our deepest fears we left behind where has time gone where has time gone run away run away i can't leave you lying there run away run away take me away from what i see run away run away i can't leave you lying there run away run away to the place where innocence is real no and now you're lying there it kills me inside to see the bride of my youth clinging to life destined to leave me time is running out causing my heart to bleed the bride of my youth clinging to life destined to leave me.     </segment1>
