		<segment1>You're looking out your window. And think &quot;He's better than me.&quot;. Now your heart starts burnin', And think &quot;My life is ending&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>Your mind is thinking, it's Jealousy. Now, turn and run away. Your mind is thinking, it's killing me. Now turn and run away. Don't try to solve a temporary problem, With a permanent solution.    </segment2>
