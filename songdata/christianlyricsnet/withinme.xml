		<segment1>When I feel the worlds against me. Left me in the cold. Thinking I've been forgotten. Out there on my own</segment1>
		<segment2>I close my eyes and in the silence. Hear a voice so clear. Reminding me Your love. Is always right here</segment2>
		<segment3>Within me then all of my doubts disappear. And there's nothing to fear, Your love's within me. You gave me strength to believe. That all that I am and all that I'll ever need is within me</segment3>
		<segment4>When my spirit's all but broken. I'm humbled to the bone. Searching for the grace. To find my way home</segment4>
		<segment5>I take a breath, a slow deep breath. And feel a sense of calm. Then the hurt in my heart is suddenly gone</segment5>
		<segment6>Within me you wiped away all my tears. There's nothing to fear, Your love's within me. It gives me the strength to believe. That all that I am and all that I'll ever need is within me    </segment6>
