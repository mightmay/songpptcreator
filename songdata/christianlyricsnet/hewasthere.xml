		<segment1>I will sing to the Lord. I will sing to the Lord. He is high above and lifted up. He is high above and lifted up</segment1>
		<segment2>He was there for me in the desert. He was there for me on the mountain top. He was there for me when there was no water. He was there for me and He gave me a drink</segment2>
		<segment3>In the desert He was there. On the mountain He was there. In the valley deep He was there. Everywhere I look my God is there    </segment3>
