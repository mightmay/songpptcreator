		<segment1>Where once the moon was just a rock spinning in the sky, Where once the stars were only tiny points of light, Now the moon looks like it's heaven's shining pearl. Now those stars, they look like windows into another world.</segment1>
		<segment2>Look what love has done to me, Look what love has done. There's poetry in all I see. Look what love has done. And my heart is dancing through each day;. My soul is running free. Look what love has done to me.</segment2>
		<segment3>Where once each breath was just a sigh of aching emptiness, Where once I hardly felt the beating in my chest, Now each breath feels like a precious kiss of life. Now inside me beat the wings of a thousand butterflies.</segment3>
		<segment4>Look what love has done to me, Look what love has done. This must be how it's meant to be. Look what love has done. And my heart is dancing through each day;. My soul is running free. Look what love has done to me.</segment4>
		<segment5>And I can't tell: was that a violin, Or did you say something?. Was that lightning striking where I stand, Or did you just reach out and take my hand?</segment5>
		<segment6>Look what love has done to me, Look what love has done. There's poetry in all I see. Look what love has done. Now my heart is dancing through each day;. My soul is running free. Look what love has done to, oh, Done to me. Look what love has done to me. Dancing through each day. Oh, to me.    </segment6>
