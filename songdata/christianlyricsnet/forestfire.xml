		<segment1>Hes not bulletproof. Dont let him fool you. His laugh is a lie. Hes dying inside. From the sticks and stones somebody threw</segment1>
		<segment2>Our tongues are like matches. Our ears are like trees. Our words are like sparks. On dry summer leaves. It doesnt take much. For the flames to rise. And turn a soul. Into a forest fire</segment2>
		<segment3>Shes not half as strong, no. As shed like to let on. She smiles, but she knows. She cant take one more blow. From the hate that shes heard for so long</segment3>
		<segment4>Our tongues are like matches. Our ears are like trees. Our words are like sparks. On dry summer leaves. It doesnt take much. For the flames to rise. And turn a soul. Into a forest fire</segment4>
		<segment5>Be careful. Be careful what you say</segment5>
		<segment6>Our tongues are like matches. Our ears are like trees. Our words are like sparks. On dry summer leaves. It doesnt take much. For the flames to rise. And turn a soul. Into a forest fire.     </segment6>
