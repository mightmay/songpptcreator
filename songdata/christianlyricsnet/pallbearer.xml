		<segment1>The darkest words, the darkest thoughts. You left me now. I'm so lost. How can this pain be taken away?. How can this be in your own name?. I swear even the dead want you alive. One last kiss as we say our goodbyes. Save us from ourselves. Save us, we need you now. Bury me with you and never let my hand go. I'll think of you forever. I'll sing melodies over your grave. Songs of remembrance. And the lives you saved. I'll think of you forever. When we meet again. Will you still have that loving skeleton?.     </segment1>
