		<segment1>We were the ones who weren't afraid. We were the broken-hearted. We were the scars that wouldn't fade away. How did we let go?. How did we forget that we don't have to hide?. We won't believe the lies again. We won't be paralyzed</segment1>
		<segment2>We can be who we are, now we are alive. We can fight, they cannot contain us. It's who we are, we are undying. We are forever. We won't hide our faces from the light. Eliminate the space between us. It's who we are, we are forever. It's who we are</segment2>
		<segment3>We were the tears that passion cried. We were the sacrificed. We were the flame that wouldn't die inside. How did we go wrong?. We will not forget, we won't get left behind. We won't give up this fight again. We won't be denied</segment3>
		<segment4>We can be who we are, now we are alive. We can fight, they cannot contain us. It's who we are, we are undying. We are forever. We won't hide our faces from the light. Eliminate the space between us. It's who we are, we are forever. It's who we are</segment4>
		<segment5>We will never die. We will never die. We will not deny. Now we are alive</segment5>
		<segment6>We can be who we are, now we are alive. We can fight, they cannot contain us. It's who we are, we are undying. We are forever. We won't hide our faces from the light. Eliminate the space between us. It's who we are, we are forever. It's who we are    </segment6>
