		<segment1>What ya sayin', don't look at me. You got a problem, totally. My hearts pumpin' adrenaline. You wanna fight. You're gonna die</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm not like that at all</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey struggle a bad fear. You'll see tomorrow I'll be near. And my pistol is firin'. You wanna go, I said no</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't even think you got me wired. You'll never know just what I mean. I am the poet and the liar. Not at all like what you think. I am the saved my beloved. Take control of every fall. I am not like that at all    </segment4>
