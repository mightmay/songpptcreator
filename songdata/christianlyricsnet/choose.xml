		<segment1>Let me be in love with what You love. Let me be most satisfied in You. Forsaking what this world has offered me. I choose to be in love with You. I will choose to be in love with You</segment1>
		<segment2>Let me know the peace that's mine in You. Let me know the joy my heart can sing. For I have nothing Lord apart from You. I choose to call on Christ in me. I will choose to call on Christ in me</segment2>
		<segment3>For in the fullness of who You are. I can rest in this place. And giving over this, my journey Lord. I see nothing but Your face</segment3>
		<segment4>Let me know that You have loved me first. Let me know the weight of my response. For You have long pursued my wandering heart. I choose to glory in Your cross. I will choose to glory in Your cross</segment4>
		<segment5>And I bow down.. Humbly, I bow down.. Humbly, I bow down.. I bow down..</segment5>
		<segment6>I bow down, I bow down. my beloved- here I am. I bow down, I bow down to You..    </segment6>
