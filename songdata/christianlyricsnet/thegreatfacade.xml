		<segment1>Lost among the rind, the wastes of space, the ones we hold so high.. Somethings different here, maybe the air, maybe a different look; a smile.</segment1>
		<segment2>..Your eyes are so..</segment2>
		<segment3>Heard this once before, one who shined. against the cold embrace. Peel away the lies, the great faade. Left with thing more..than you.</segment3>
		<segment4>..I know your eyes..</segment4>
		<segment5>Where, where do you hide your wings?. Tell me.. Where, where do you hide your wings?</segment5>
		<segment6>Lost inside this noise, so cold. Every light is listening. Open up your mouth, speak in truth. Dont let it all, slip away.. The mirror it never lies, so know. Blinded..we all become dead..</segment6>
		<segment7>Where, where do you hide your wings?. Tell me.. Where, where do you hide your wings?. Show me..</segment7>
		<segment8>Where, where do you hide your wings?. Tell me.. Where, where do you hide your wings..    </segment8>
