		<segment1>Where am I!? Where are you?. There's so much time so little to do. We're busy doing nothing cause it's vanity we prize. You can't see nothing cause you can't see through your eyes. They're covered with a film, you're blinded by yourself. You're the one to blame but you pretend it's someone else.</segment1>
		<segment2>Life could you be a little softer to me?. Life could you be more gentle to me?. Softer, softer, softer.. Softer to me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm still alive. That much is true. I've never lied, well, I guess I've told a few. There's nothing to see because I brought nothing to show. The conversation got too deep, I shrug and tell you I' don't know. This world can get so hard, this world can be so cruel, Sometimes I fall apart I feel just like a useless tool.</segment3>
		<segment4>Life could you be a little softer to me?. Life could you be more gentle to me?. Yeah I know, this is a selfish plea, Because Christ sacrificed His flesh. On the cross for me. But this world is hard, It's cruel and I wish it could be.. Softer, softer, softerÂ…. Softer to me    </segment4>
