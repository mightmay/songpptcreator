		<segment1>Landlocked eyes, jealous mind that won't stop for me now. One time find, lover's prize that won't stop for me</segment1>
		<segment2>But it's you that makes the moutains move. and sets them in their places</segment2>
		<segment3>The day breaks, the night falls, and don't I look the same as everyone?</segment3>
		<segment4>Put their hope in one more kiss. that won't stop for me now. And hide their wounds inside their hearts. and they hardly breathe</segment4>
		<segment5>the day breaks, the night falls, and don't I look the same?. But love come, and change me. so I hope in You and nothing else</segment5>
		<segment6>Stone set eyes, fixed on life that won't stop    </segment6>
