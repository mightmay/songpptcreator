		<segment1>The only thing I recall is. Those shadows coming my way. Comforting me with their searchlights. To guide me home again. We will take. We will take. That wretched heart away. And when you come to. You'll thank us. For the new you we've made</segment1>
		<segment2>So now I'm left here fading away. Far away. Far away. So now I'm left here fading away. Far away. Far away. From me</segment2>
		<segment3>So now I wait as they make me. Into someone else. If I believe what they tell me. I'm tired of being myself. Cause they take and the take. A piece of me everyday. And we will help you belong here. With this new you we've made</segment3>
		<segment4>If you you can amputate my heart. Then I will learn to smile and then. You can replace me with yourself. And I'll become the model citizen. And I will tell them all. That I had this breakthrough surgery. They give you a pill. They remove your heart. And replace it with a battery    </segment4>
