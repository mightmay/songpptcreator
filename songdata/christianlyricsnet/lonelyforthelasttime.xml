		<segment1>Driving on the road to home, a few cars back maybe three in front. I don't know, all I know is we are going way too slow. The guy in front takes a left, the others follow I am left alone. Maybe this will be the day that I'm going home. And I feel lonely for the last time. Walking on the road to home, I take three steps and I fall backward five more. I want to stop building up these walls between us. The walls of pride, the walls of pain. Break through these and make me whole again. I cannot wait to be with You Lord Jesus. And I feel lonely for the last time. See the walls, see the walls come crashing down around us. Now we..now we are together. And feel lonely for the last time.     </segment1>
