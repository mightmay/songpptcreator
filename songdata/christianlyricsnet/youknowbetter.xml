		<segment1>I saw you staring out your window. Watching the people passing by. Taking some notes on what you saw out there. So you would know how hard you need to try</segment1>
		<segment2>I heard you asking lots of questions. How in comparison you stand. Please let me warn you to be very careful. God want's our best and not our better than</segment2>
		<segment3>But you know better, better than that. You know better than, better than that. You should know better, truth is the only measure. You know better than, better than that</segment3>
		<segment4>Now just in case I've got you thinkin'. And if you're feeling like I do. Maybe it's time we open up the Holy Bible. And see exactly what He's called us to. He said the least would be the greatest. The greatest is the one who serves. We must be living by a different standard. A life that isn't graded on a curve</segment4>
		<segment5>But you know better, better than that. You know better than, better than that. You should know better, truth is the only measure. You know better than, better than that.     </segment5>
