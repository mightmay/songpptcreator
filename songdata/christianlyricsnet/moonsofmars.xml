		<segment1>You ask me the question &quot; Why?. I'll give you the answer &quot; In time. I'll give you a drawing of all. I'll paint you a picture of Jesus &quot; He's all. He is all, He is all you ever wanted, He is all</segment1>
		<segment2>What if I was stranger than angels. Cause then I would be the one</segment2>
		<segment3>Turn around &quot; And see. The waves of the ocean and of the sea. I'll show all the moons of Mars. The love of heaven and of the stars</segment3>
