		<segment1>Choose your subject and fill the frame. Leave the crime scene just as quietly as you came. You've been providing evidence. And all the puzzle pieces fit. You are who they say you are. You've framed yourself in innocence. The jury's out and they're convinced. You are who they say you are</segment1>
		<segment2>Just point and shoot. That's all you do. To help yourself feel free. Murder by photography. It's simply pathetic how photosynthetic. Your life has become. Staring at the mirror plotting your next move. Finding new ways to improve</segment2>
		<segment3>A witness claims your case is a charade. Accusations made have turned this into a game you know. Now by your rules we play. The day turns, the room adjourns. And we're stuck in the same place. Your defense is under attack. And they're not cutting any slack. You are who you say you are. Snap snap another photograph. You've been exposed and can't turn back. You are who you say you are</segment3>
		<segment4>It's simply pathetic how photosynthetic. Your life has become. Staring at the mirror plotting your next move. Finding new ways to improve. Just point and shoot. That's all you do. To help yourself feel free. Murder by photography    </segment4>
