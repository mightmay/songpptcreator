		<segment1>Pictures on a doorstep and no lack of hesitation. Need a drummer, cause I've got imagination. You know we're going places I don't wanna go. Just stand off, I'll stack your face and pretend you look good</segment1>
		<segment2>We don't wanna play because we've tracked an education. Lead us when you see we've got the motivation. You know we're going places I don't wanna go. Just stand off, I'll stack your face and pretend you look good. You know we're going places I don't wanna go. Just stand off, I'll stack your face and pretend you look good</segment2>
		<segment3>You know we're going places I don't wanna go. Just stand off, I'll stack your face and pretend you look good. You know we're going places I don't wanna go. Just stand off, I'll stack your face and pretend you look good</segment3>
		<segment4>Going places..    </segment4>
