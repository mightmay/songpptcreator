		<segment1>Basically, everything is going wrong and your only heart is gone. It is out of reach and it's grown. But you didn't breakdown. You pressed on and found out that everyone preaching God has turned of all their lights. Or they have buried their teeth inside a contradicting life. Wait: Don't gnash your teeth and waste away. Have you fallen asleep with a dagger in between your bones?. That was thoughtfully placed by your own wretched finesse. Watching, all the sparks start to fade, and everyone looses their way, the monsters that they make.. Well, don't blame the wine glass for the drunkard, dig up your bones. Watching, all the new become mundane, and the sun turns into rain. Distances don't fade, what's golden is now gray. Walk on, and you'll never walk alone</segment1>
