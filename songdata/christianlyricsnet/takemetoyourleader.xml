		<segment1>Isabelle is a belly dancer. With a kleptomaniac's restraint. Tried stealing Helena's hand basket. Made a fast getaway. But McQueen she ain't. At the courtroom Joshua judges her. Ruthlessly on account of Ruth walking. Out on him. In the Big House Isabelle is a-telling all. To the chaplain who's become her friend </segment1>
		<segment2>She said, &quot;I don't know why you care. I don't know what's out there. I don't know where or how. Just take me to your leader now. Take me to your leader now&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>Justin is adjustin' to the odor from. Theodore's Evergreen Incense. But aroma therapy don't make him any. Younger than Oliver's All Liver Supplements. His late mate Merrilee merrily said. Immortality can't be bought in a jar. This just in: Justin's had enough of cure-alls. Gonna quiz the neighbor kid with the fish on his car </segment3>
		<segment4>He said, &quot;I don't know why you care. I don't know what's out there. I don't know how it's done. Just take me to your leader, son&quot;</segment4>
		<segment5>I see you've got the joy. I've seen you livin' oi. It's real, it's free, it's fun, So take me to your leader , son </segment5>
		<segment6>They don't know why we care. They don't know what's out there. They don't know how it's done. Let's take 'em to our leader son </segment6>
		<segment7>They see we've got the joy. They see us livin' oi. It's real, It's free, It's fun, Let's take 'em to our leader son.     </segment7>
