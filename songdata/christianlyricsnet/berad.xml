		<segment1>Sometimes in a crowd we get talkin' real loud. Making fun of weird folks, turn their lives into jokes. I don't think it's fair when we start not to care. I think it's a shame, because we live in Jesus' name. We dance the night away, making fun of everybodies clothes. We drink the night away, and we pray that no one will ever know our insecurities. They make us act all big and bad. We're never sure of these. Lots of lip, and make ya' not be rad. You dance the night away, making fun of everybodies clothes. You drink the night away, and you pray that no one will ever know your insecurities. They make you act all big and bad. You're never sure of these. Lots of lip, and make ya' not be rad.    </segment1>
