		<segment1>Take this life. Forgive me for the words I spoke before they ever left my throat. My heart would rather rebel than obey. Forgive me for this life of sin I know. I need a new beginning Lord I've gone astray. Take this life make it yours. Do what's right oh Lord. You got to take this life take this life. You got to make it make it right. Take my flesh take my pride take the sins I try. To hide take my doubts take my fears. all the pain and all the tears and I fall down on my knees. Lord I'm begging ya please Lord. Take the shame take the blame it's all the same. Take this life. Make it right. Take this life. I don't want to live a life that's compromising to the King. I'd rather live for you than live for me or anything. Take this life (and all my hidden sins). Do what's right (and everything within) oh Lord. You got take this take this life. You got make it right    </segment1>
