		<segment1>Hands on the clock count the minutes, the hours. Your love has the power, stronger than time or space. You're the rock that I stand on, my anchor. To You I will give all the praise. And there's nothing that I've got to hide. With the power of God on my side</segment1>
		<segment2>Now and forever. I promise I will always love You. All my life. One thing I know for sure. We'll be together. Every day I'll love You better. More and more. Now and forever I'm Yours. Now and forever I'm Yours</segment2>
		<segment3>Lost in a dream, under stars, under moonlight, You are the one Light leading me out of the dark. You're the breath that I breathe, all that I need. Nothing will keep us apart. And I'm giving You my guarantee. That in You I will always believe..I believe</segment3>
		<segment4>All that I have I'll give to You. You know that there's nothing that I won't do. Whatever it takes, whatever it takes    </segment4>
