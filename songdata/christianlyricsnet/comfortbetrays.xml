		<segment1>You sat and watched. As I nearly destroyed myself. Never had I felt so betrayed. That you would sacrifice my life. For no more than comfort. And now your love means nothing to me. You are a coward, the antithesis of a friend. Take action before there is. No one left to defend. For I would have stood by you. Right to the gates of hell.     </segment1>
