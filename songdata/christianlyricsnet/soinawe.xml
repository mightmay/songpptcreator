		<segment4>Together we will seek You. Forever we will praise You. You are the Father of our hearts. Never ceasing to love You. Never forgetting Your truth. You are the Father of our hearts</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Here we are now. Set apart now. So in awe of You. Here we are now. Set on fire now. So in awe of You.     </segment5>
