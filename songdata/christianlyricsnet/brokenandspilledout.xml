		<segment1>VERSE 1. One day a plain village woman. Driven by love for her Lord. Recklessly poured out a valuable essence. Disregarding the scorn. And once it was broken and spilled out. A fragrance filled all the room. Like a pris'ner released from his shackles. Like a spirit set free from the tomb</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS 1. Broken and spilled out. Just for love of you Jesus. My most precious treasure. Lavished on Thee. Broken and spilled out. And poured at Your feet. In sweet abandon. Let me be spilled out. And used up for Thee</segment2>
		<segment3>VERSE 2. Lord You were God's precious treasure. His loved and His own perfect Son. Sent here to show me. The love of the Father. Just for love it was done. And though You were perfect and holy. You gave up Yourself willingly. You spared no expense for my pardon. You were used up and wasted for me </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS 2. Broken and spilled out. Just for love of me Jesus. God's most precious treasure. Lavished on me. You were broken and spilled out. And poured at my feet. In sweet abandon Lord. You were spilled out and used up for Me </segment4>
		<segment5>TAG. In sweet abandon, let me be spilled out. And used up for Thee    </segment5>
