		<segment1>Do I dare question it?. This world is ending with countless years of false doubting. Let's get up and arise. Speculation. Your dreams are long gone. Now you told me to never hold back mercy. So, this is now evolving into your own interpretation. Let's just call this fair play. Slice them off, and restore the foundation. We must begin the downfall of their branches. We are always too quick to point the finger on our closest companions. Fly away into a dream full of hope, soar above the branches and into the faraway stars.    </segment1>
