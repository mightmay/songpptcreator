		<segment1>all we've lost. is so much more. i can't believe all the things i see. so many people strung out on vanity. a lust for something more. so much more than we're given. now it's too late. me made our mistakes. can't we change the way we're living?. i don't know why. we try and try to be something more than we are not. no matter how we lie. we'll never mask what's inside. will tyou be left standing?. can you carry on this charade?. it's all we've lost    </segment1>
