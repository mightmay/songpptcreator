		<segment1>Don't even try to tell me what prayer is for. my Genie in a bottle needs to give me some more. and when this mess is over-I don't need Him anymore. I'll put my God back on temporary ignore</segment1>
		<segment2>If you will do what I need you to do. I'll find some time to praise you when this whole thing is through. If you get me out of this, Oh great Almighty. I promise I'll never do it again-well maybe</segment2>
		<segment3>I get along fine most of the time. no thought for thanks or blessings sublime. when turmoil breaks through the shell of my comfort. my lack of a prayer life abort</segment3>
		<segment4>White knucklin the rosary. I know my God by what He does for me. open only in case of emergency. white knucklin the rosary</segment4>
		<segment5>When turmoil breaks through the shell of my comfort. my lack of a prayer life abort</segment5>
		<segment6>An acrostic for prayer that I learned as a kid. praise and repentance, ask for others, yourself. but now in my lackluster state of affairs. give me what I ask for-beyond that who cares?</segment6>
		<segment7>White knucklin the rosary. I know my God by what He does for me. open only in case of emergency. white knucklin the rosary</segment7>
		<segment8>Pray without ceasing-give thanks for all things. a prayer life that's missing the joy that can bring.     </segment8>
