		<segment1>Ah!</segment1>
		<segment2>Everyone dies. Everyone loves a fight. Nothing is sound. Nothing is right side right. Evening comes, when the sun goes down in red. Nothing is cool. When will all the fighting end. When will all the fighting end</segment2>
		<segment3>Happy is a yuppie word. Nothing in the world could fail me now. It's empty as an argument. I'm running down a life that won't cash out (cash out)</segment3>
		<segment4>Everything fails. Everything runs it's course. A time and a place, for all of this loving war. Everyone buys, everyone's gotta price, and nothing is new. When will all the failures rise. When will all the failures rise, rise!</segment4>
		<segment5>Happy is a yuppie word. Nothing in the world could fail me now. It's empty as an argument. I'm running down a life that won't cash out</segment5>
		<segment6>Happy is a yuppie word. Blessed is the man who's lost it all. Happy is a yuppie word (word)</segment6>
		<segment7>Looking for an orphanage. I'm looking for a bridge I can't burn down. I don't believe the emptiness. I'm looking for the kingdom coming down. Everything is meaningless. I want more than simple cash can buy. Happy is a yuppie word. Happy is a yuppie word. Happy is a yuppie word. Happy is a yuppie</segment7>
		<segment8>Nothing is sound. Nothing is sound. Nothing is sound. Nothing is sound. Nothing is sound. Nothing is sound. Nothing is sound</segment8>
		<segment9>Happy is a yuppie word. Nothing in the world could fail me now. Happy is a yuppie word (word)</segment9>
		<segment10>So calm down, yeah!. So calm down, yeah!. So calm down, yeah!    </segment10>
