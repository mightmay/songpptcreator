		<segment1>Take me to the place where you are. Where my burdens fall down at your feet. Where your spirit comes to carry me. Take me away where I can be near you. Where the sun is bright and warms my face. where I feel alive in your embrace. God youre all Ill ever need. And to be with you. will you carry me away to your secret and your holy place?. Where Im all wrapped up in you  wrapped up in your arms. God Im wrapped up in your arms.    </segment1>
