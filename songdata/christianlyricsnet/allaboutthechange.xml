		<segment1>It's the same thing, the same dream every time. You're running in a straight line. Speeding through the light</segment1>
		<segment2>And you're stronger than you've ever been. In a place you've never seen. And everything is right</segment2>
		<segment3>And something's calling. Something's haunting you. And you want it - and you want it</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: It's all about to change. Nothing stays the same. It's getting closer every single day</segment4>
		<segment5>It's all about to change. It'll never be the same. Any day now you will start again</segment5>
		<segment6>And you wake, a stranger to your bed. But science tells your head. That nothing looks the same in the light</segment6>
		<segment7>And your day's spent looking for the dream. Is it going to come again?. Could anything be so bright?</segment7>
		<segment8>Hear it calling. All day long. And you want it - and you want it</segment8>
		<segment9>[Chorus]    </segment9>
