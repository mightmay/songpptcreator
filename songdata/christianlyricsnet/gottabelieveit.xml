		<segment1>I'm just a human on this planet for a little while. I'm a crazy believer. I'm not singing just to make you smil. I wanna tell you the truth. I'm not a superstar, ut it don't matter who you are. He's always there for you even when life's not fair. I want you to know.</segment1>
		<segment2>Everyday's not gonna go your way. You're gonna be okay. Gotta believe, just believe it. His love for you is gonna get you through. There's nothing God can't do. Gotta believe it, just believe it.</segment2>
		<segment3>We're the same you and me. We've got two hands and two feet. I think I know how you're feling. I've seen my dreams run away. Just like you I've been afraid. I belieed all the lies.</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll tell you the truth, 'cause I want you to know..</segment4>
