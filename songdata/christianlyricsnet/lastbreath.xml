		<segment1>I'm not here to reform you. Nor am I here to take you away. I've been sent with a message. And now moving off in a south-bound parade</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). If this were my last breath. I tell you where I'll be. Then I'd ask you if you'd be there with me</segment2>
		<segment3>Nobody knows how long you will be here. Still you hazard your faith. As my last day grows closer. I rest in the confidence I have been saved</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus 2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>You don't know how long. And I don't know how long    </segment5>
