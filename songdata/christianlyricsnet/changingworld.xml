		<segment1>I thought I had it all under control. I thought my fate was still in my hands. All of my plans were firmly set. By the words that I say </segment1>
		<segment2>I forgot how quickly things can change. Now my vision can not be the same </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS:]. My life is not what I thought. I'm not where I planned to be. Though something's gone. There's nothing wrong with my changing world. Though something's gone. There's nothing wrong with my changing world </segment3>
		<segment4>I need to let go of my destiny. I need to trust in things unseen. I believe in having faith. Though I yield my control </segment4>
		<segment5>I forgot how quickly things can change. Now my vision can not be the same </segment5>
		<segment6>[BRIDGE:]. I'm embracing all of my fears. I am watching them turn to delight. The very fears which were gripping my mind. Are now the hands shaping and sculpting my dreams.     </segment6>
