		<segment1>Come, ye sinners, poor and needy. Weak and wounded, sick and sore. Jesus ready, stands to save you. Full of pity, love and power</segment1>
		<segment2>I will arise and go to Jesus. He will embrace me in His arms. In the arms of my dear Savior, O, there are ten thousand charms</segment2>
		<segment3>Come, ye thirsty, come and welcome. God's free bounty glorify. True belief and true repentance. Every grace that brings you nigh</segment3>
		<segment4>Come, ye weary, heavy-laden. Lost and ruined by the fall. If you tarry 'til you're better. You will never come at all</segment4>
		<segment5>I will arise and go to Jesus. He will embrace me in His arms. In the arms of my dear Savior, O, there are ten thousand charms</segment5>
		<segment6>See Him Prostate in the garden. On the ground your Maker lies. On the bloody tree, behold him. Sinner, will this not suffice?&quot;</segment6>
		<segment7>Lo! the incarnate God ascended. Pleads the merit of his blood. Venture on him, venture wholly. Let no other trust intrude</segment7>
		<segment8>I will arise and go to Jesus. He will embrace me in His arms. In the arms of my dear Savior, O, there are ten thousand charms     </segment8>
