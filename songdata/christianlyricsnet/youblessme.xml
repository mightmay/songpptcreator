		<segment1>I messed up my little world. Broke Your heart and about lost my mind. So far from You and so far gone. But Your love was there for me to find </segment1>
		<segment2>O You just took ahold of me. And my tears were flowing freely. But Your joy came in the morning. And You blessed me. O You blessed me. You could have shunned me. But You blessed me </segment2>
		<segment3>Now when I'm running out of rope. With less of me there's more of You. I worship You my only hope. 'Cause You're dear to me and I belog to You </segment3>
		<segment4>O You just took ahold of me. And now I'm living freely. 'Cause You're joy comes in the morning. And You bless me. You bless me. You bless me </segment4>
		<segment5>Your goodness led me to repentance. I fell down on my knees. Instead of judgement You gave me mercy. Now I am living in Your presence. Your love just flows so free. And Lord You take good care of me </segment5>
		<segment6>And You bless me. You bless me. You bless me. O You bless me    </segment6>
