		<segment1>The cure for pain is in the pain, so it's there that you'll find me. Until again I forget, and again he reminds me, &quot;Hear my voice in your head, and think of me kindly.&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>Let me be, let me be. </segment2>
		<segment3>Lowered down like a casket. and buried just below her chest. &quot;Whatever I was searching for, it was never you,&quot; she says. The record ended long ago, we go on dancing nonetheless. </segment3>
		<segment4>I opened like a locket, &quot;If you're ever cold,&quot; I wrote, &quot;there's warmth inside me. I'm the pocket of an old winter coat.&quot;. But where she used to say &quot;I need you.&quot;. Now..&quot;I don't.&quot; </segment4>
		<segment5>You'd only make the softest sound, like sugar pouring into tea. Darling let your Self pour down. and dissolve into the Love. who revealed himself there quietly to me.. </segment5>
		<segment6>(Jesus have mercy on us.).     </segment6>
