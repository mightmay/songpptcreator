		<segment1>Take my life, take it all. I lay it at Your throne. I am rich, satisfied, when I am Yours alone</segment1>
		<segment2>I have learned to live to lose. I have found my home in You. And I count it all as lose it true. 'Cause I have learned to live to lose</segment2>
		<segment3>Precious One, crucified. Died to set me free. I hold nothing back from You. Who gave it all for me</segment3>
		<segment4>I have learned to live to lose. I have found my home in You. And I count it all as lose it true. 'Cause I have learned to live to lose</segment4>
		<segment5>Jeus You're the One, You're the only One for me. Jeus You're the One, You're the only One for me. Jeus You're the One, You're the only One for me. Jeus You're the One, You're the only One for me</segment5>
		<segment6>I have learned to live to lose. I have found my home in You. I count it all as lose it true. I have learned to live. Yes I have learned to live to lose. I have learned to live to lose     </segment6>
