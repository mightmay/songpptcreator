		<segment1>I am struggling to find a way to make myself attractive. to You, attractive to You. I am trying to be more deserving of the gift You gave. to me, so free</segment1>
		<segment2>It's funny how all I can be is someone completely ugly. And yet when You look at me, You don't see a wretch, You see a reflection of something beautiful</segment2>
		<segment3>I am searching for the water that can wash me clean. enough to earn Your love. I want to stop all the things that break Your heart, but. come so natural to me, naturally</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't believe you could fall in love with me    </segment4>
