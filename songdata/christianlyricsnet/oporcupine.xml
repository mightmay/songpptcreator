		<segment1>Without a queen the locust swarm. turned the ground to black. descending like a shadowy tower on a fish's back. and scattered the sticks who crawled. like snakes in the sand. as the red clay took the form of a lizard. who rushed like a moth to the flame of my open hand </segment1>
		<segment2>[while, in my little world..]. a speckled bird humbly inspired. ran across the road when it could have flown. and it made me smile. at the water's edge, Babylon. we laid down and slept. as the river wept for you, O'Zion!. the stones cry out, bells shake the sky. all creation groans.. </segment2>
		<segment3>SHHHH!!! </segment3>
		<segment4>listen to it! </segment4>
		<segment5>messes of men in farmer poverty;. not much for monks but we pretend to be. share a silent meal and a pot of chamomile. gypsies like us should be stamped in solidarity. I hold you in my fond but distant memory. while for the Mother Hen to gather me. who regretfully wrote, </segment5>
		<segment6>&quot;you have a decent ear for notes. but you can't yet appreciate harmony.&quot; </segment6>
		<segment7>O' porcupine perched low in the tree. your ees to mine: </segment7>
		<segment8>&quot;you'd be well inclined not to mess with me.&quot; </segment8>
		<segment9>at the garden's edge beneath a speechless sky. as his friends all slept. Jesus wept- and no wonder. and now you say you wanna be set free??. and wanna set me free???. well I'm told that can only come from. a union with the One who never dies.     </segment9>
