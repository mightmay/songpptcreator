		<segment1>Is it just a car or is it so much more? It's a superstar with the gas to the floor. Zero to sixty in remarkable time. Its the automobile that's top of the line. We got a k car on the road of life. We're gonna get far if the driver's Christ. Is it just a car or is it so much more? It's a superstar with the gas to the floor. In a drag race all the others fall and Brandon Ebel just gave us a call.     </segment1>
