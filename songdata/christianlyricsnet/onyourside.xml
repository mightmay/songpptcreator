		<segment1>You dont have to stay here, You cant deny. Every single heartaches, Written in your eyes. Memories that haunt you, Memories they got you. Looking for a place to hide, Oh, the anger, Reaching like a cancer, Like a paralyzing fear. Can you even hear me, When I whisper. Can you see Me through your tears?</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Cuz I Im on your side, Well win this fight, So rest to-night, Cuz love is on the rise, The darkness blinds, Im on your side. Oh, Im on your side.</segment2>
		<segment3>I know my love can shine through, Bitterness that hides you. Deep inside a world, With no hope. Letting go of history, We can start a journey. You dont have to do this alone, Youre not alone. Chorus:</segment3>
		<segment4>When you hope is lost, And the flames burn high. When your weakness fuels, What you feel inside. Oh, dont look back ,Your past is back. Youre still alive ,Youre still alive</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: Cuz I Im on your side, Well win this fight. You can rest to-night, Cuz love is on the rise. The darkness blinds, Im on your side. Oh, Im on your side.</segment5>
		<segment6>You can rest tonight. Im on your side. Repeat.    </segment6>
