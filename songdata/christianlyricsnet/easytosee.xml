		<segment1>Oh we are easy to see. We're all together Oh we are easy to see. We're all together Looking at You, we're barely believing. The way that Your face can light up an evening. All together for a glimpse of You. Trying to be still while You're moving through us</segment1>
		<segment2>Now if You are through, finished saying Your peace. Could You say it again? Because we don't want to leave. We're resting in the hollow of Your hand. And it's so much more than we can stand. Every one of us here Forever to be changed. Together Wearing Your name.    </segment2>
