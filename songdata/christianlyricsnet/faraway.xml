		<segment1>Something. Keeps on pulling me down. And i feel. Like i'm losing ground. Trying. Just to find my reasons. And losing sense of what is real</segment1>
		<segment2>Willing. To believe in something. Forgetting. To believe in me. Will i. Find my place in your mind. Or will i fall away in time</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Now i'm feeling. So far away. And now i'm hating you. Every day</segment3>
		<segment4>Waiting. Just to see the image. You follow. Down that road again. Trying. Just to find your purpose. You're fading faster every day</segment4>
		<segment5>Willing. To believe in something. Forgetting. To believe in me. Will i. Find my place in your mind. Or will i fall away in time</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Now i feel i'm losing time. Yesterday. Slipped away. When you didn't know. Time and time again you wanted. More than i had to give. To leave me with nothing. I'm waiting. And dreaming. Yesterday. Slipped away. When you didn't know. And no more waiting. Let me back</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus x2</segment8>
		<segment9>(Now i'm feeling). So far away x3    </segment9>
