		<segment1>Silhouettes, they all show,</segment1>
		<segment2>This will pass like yesterday, The rain will come and wash away, And fill me with your sweet sweet air, I cried out and you were there,</segment2>
		<segment3>Like the wind that I cannot see, But I know it's there right in front of me, You're everywhere, oh oh oh, You're everywhere,</segment3>
		<segment4>I cried wolf to you again, And then denied this in my head, Cause I ran to the other side, Only to then change my mind,</segment4>
		<segment5>Like the wind that I cannot see, But I know it's there right in front of me, You're everywhere, oh oh oh, You're everywhere, What if I fall?. What if I break?. I'm living life so I'll make my mistakes, You're everywhere, oh oh oh, You're everywhere,</segment5>
		<segment6>Silhouettes, they all show,</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm losing myself again, And your patient with me, I'm building these walls again, Please rescue me,</segment7>
		<segment8>Silhouettes, they all show, Silhouettes, would you let me know?</segment8>
		<segment9>Like the wind that I cannot see, But I know it's there right in front of me, You're everywhere, oh oh oh, You're everywhere, What if I fall?. What if I break?. I'm living my life, I will make my mistakes, You're everywhere, oh oh oh, You're everywhere,</segment9>
		<segment10>Oh, oh,</segment10>
		<segment11>Silhouettes, they all show.     </segment11>
