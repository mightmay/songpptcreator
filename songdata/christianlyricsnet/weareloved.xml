		<segment1>(Verse 1). Velvet black night. Pierced with white. Stars waiting quiet. Wide listening sky</segment1>
		<segment2>Stillness of air. Life hanging there. Out of despair. Rises a prayer</segment2>
		<segment3>(Pre-Chorus). Can we take in Your light. So we can shine like You?. With all this weariness. Can we shine like You?. With this weariness</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). O we are loved. We are loved. And it's quite enough that. We are loved</segment4>
		<segment5>We are loved. We are loved. And it's quite enough that</segment5>
		<segment6>We are loved</segment6>
		<segment7>If the whole world could feel like. If the whole world could feel like. We could love. We could love. 'Cause we are loved</segment7>
		<segment8>(Verse 2). Surrounded in white. O purest bride. No lovelier sight. The church will rise</segment8>
		<segment9>Take in Your light. To shine like You. Take this weariness. O we can shine like You</segment9>
		<segment10>(Bridge). Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh..</segment10>
