		<segment1>hey hey</segment1>
		<segment2>A man stands alone arms across his chest, his heart pounding through his bones. Denial wasn't supposed to be this way. His passion feel to the ground. but beauty could be found another way, another way.</segment2>
		<segment3>Well only his answer would tell the story. Three times when all he had to say yes. say yes say yea yea yea. but denial seemed so beautiful. three times when all he had to say yes. say yes say yea yea yea. but providence took its hold</segment3>
		<segment4>hey hey</segment4>
		<segment5>Tears drown his eyes a puddle of shame at his feet. as the reflection of guilt overwhelms a broken man. Dissent is all he had and he needed a reason to believe. this doesn't only happen to me.</segment5>
		<segment6>Well only his answer would tell the story.Three times when all he had to say yes. say yes say yea yea yea. but denial seemed so beautiful. three times when all he had to say yes. say yes say yea yea yea. but providence took its hold</segment6>
		<segment7>An electric pulse you can't escape. A fore that rules the human race. Oh the hand of Providence. An electric pulse you can't escape. A fore that rules the human race. Tonight the stars tell no fortunes, they tell no fortunes</segment7>
		<segment8>Well only his answer would tell the story. Three times when all he had to say yes. say yes say yea yea yea. but denial seemed so beautiful. three times when all he had to say yes. say yes say yea yea yea. but providence took its hold</segment8>
		<segment9>Three times, Three times, Three times    </segment9>
