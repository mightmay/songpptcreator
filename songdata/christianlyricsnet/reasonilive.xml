		<segment2>From the start i couldnt figure it out. Why someone like you would die for me. But i know that your love for me is so great. And that is why im giving you my life</segment2>
		<segment3>I am yours every part of me. Jesus you're the reason i live. Take my life lord and use me as you will. Jesus you're the reason i live</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't believe that you're with me til forever. I'll never leave you and you'll never leave me. It's what i long for your presence here in my life. Cos you're the air i breathe my reason why     </segment4>
