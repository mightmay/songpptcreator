		<segment1>First time I saw you standing on the corner. Thought maybe I'd died and went to Heaven. But I got to thinking and baby, I knew better. 'Cause I know that angels dont, angels dont wear high-healed shoes. I don't need an angel. That don't fly around the blue. I'd be more than grateful. With a woman that was just like you. Chorus: Sweet baby don't you change baby don't you change. Baby don't you change, baby don't you change a thing. No baby dont you change a thing. You don't need no angel wings. You look so good you make a grown man scream oh baby no, baby no. Don't you change a thing. First time I saw your face on a photograph. I thought maybe I was looking at the cover of a magazine. oh oh oh. But I got talkin' to you and baby, I knew better. 'Cause I know most models don't, models dont know how to hold a conversation. I don't need a model, you can let 'em. flirt around the page or the stage. I'd be more than grateful. With a woman that had your face. Chorus: Sweet baby don't you change baby don't you change. Baby don't you change, baby don't you change a thing. No baby dont you change a thing. Got no love for a magazine. You look so good you make a grown man scream oh baby no, baby no. Don't you change a thing. No, no, no, no, no, no. (Chorus). Baby don't you change a thing. Baby don't you change a thing. Baby don't you change a thing. Baby don't you change, baby don't you change a thing.     </segment1>
