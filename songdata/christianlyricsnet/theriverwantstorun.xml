		<segment1>Father you love flows though your kingdom like a mighty river. You children come down to Your banks to drink the living water</segment1>
		<segment2>Your holiness abounds. Come Lord of all surround us. Reveal your endless power and Your glory. Let your spirit rise until your truth is overflowing in this land</segment2>
		<segment3>If the river wants to run who's gonna stop it now. Who's gonna keep those flood gates from bending. We'll take this broken land and turn it into a temple. Light it with your fire that is unending</segment3>
		<segment4>So take this broken man and turn him into a temple. Light him with your fire that is unending    </segment4>
