		<segment1>Began a new life. Found a love of your own. Got someone by your side. Now you don't have to be alone</segment1>
		<segment2>But you find yourself in need of more than what they can give. And it's taking all your strength within to get them to understand</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Well, there's a place within the soul. There's a place that nobody knows. It's a place where some they come and go. But no one can fulfill the Godspot. A place that's in demand. Need a lot of love someone to understand. It's a place where only He can. 'Cause no one can fulfill the Godspot</segment3>
		<segment4>Always surrounded. By so many many friends. They were like a family. Promised to be there 'til the end</segment4>
		<segment5>But then you realized you gave too much of your heart away. You put all your trust in them. You thought they would always stay</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>When everyone has let you down. Depend on God, He'll always be around. And when life seems impossible. Trust in Him, and you will find He's able. Yes, He's able, yeah</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm trying to say that things and people will never satisfy. 'Cause there is nothing or anyone who could take the place of God</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus</segment9>
		<segment10>No one can fulfill it, it's a Godspot, yes it is. No one can take the place of God    </segment10>
