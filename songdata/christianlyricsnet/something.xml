		<segment1>Well I see the winds have changed now. why'd they have to change today. My eyes are drowning in this sea of pain. the world is closing in on me. I'm slowly sinking in my insides. a float is sinking inside me. my eyes are cold, black, and empty. can anybody set me free</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Oh I need something I need something more I need you. Oh I need something I need something more I need you</segment2>
		<segment3>passion is the only friend I have. its better lieing to me. my eyes are blurring as i fight to stay alive. bound and broken on my knees</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Why would we live let the healing begin. why would we live i'm suffering, I'm suffering. why would we live let the healing begin. why would we live i'm suffering, i'm suffering</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)    </segment6>
