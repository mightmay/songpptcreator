		<segment1>Cold Addiction rising up inside, white lines cover the mirror. All the voices screaming in my mind, I wanna get out of here.</segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 1: Starring through a hole blind eyes ashamed. A blurry vision soul dying for change. Every minute fighting with myself a fiend again. The river of excuses I've been drowning in. Lost my head again, like I want to..</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Cold Addiction rising up inside, white lines cover the mirror. All the voices screaming in my mind, I wanna get out of here. Line by line I run from it all.</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: The symptom of a full blown addict so they say. Push it to the limit as life drip drips away. Still I love your haze, I get lost in the daze and confusion</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: Cold Addiction rising up inside, white lines cover the mirror. All the voices screaming in my mind, I wanna get out of here. Cold Addiction racing through my veins enslave me to my fear. Premonition I see it all unwind, God get me out of here. Line by line I run from it all. Bridge: Run Run Run Run.. Yeah    </segment5>
