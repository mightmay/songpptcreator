		<segment1>Caught in the half-light, I'm caught alone. Waking up to the sunrise and the radio. Feels like I'm tied up, what's holding me?. Just praying today will be the day I go free </segment1>
		<segment2>I want to live like there's no tomorrow. I want to dance like no one's around. I want to sing like nobody's listening. Before I lay my body down. I want to give like I have plenty. I want to love like I'm not afraid. I want to be the man I was meant to be. I want to be the way I was made </segment2>
		<segment3>Made in Your likeness, made with Your hands. Made to discover who You are and who I am. All I've forgotten help me to find. All that You've promised let it be in my life     </segment3>
