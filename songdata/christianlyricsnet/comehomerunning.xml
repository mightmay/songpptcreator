		<segment1>Oh heart of mine, why must you stray?. From one so fair you run away. And one more time you have to pay. The heaviness of needless shame</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh heart of mine, come back home. You've been too long out on your own. And He's been there all along. Watching for you down the road</segment2>
		<segment3>So come home running. His arms are open wide. His name is Jesus. He understands. He is the answer. You are looking for. So come home running. Just as you are</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh child of God so dearly loved. And ransomed by the Savior's blood. And called by name, Daughter and Son. Wrapped in the robe of righteousness    </segment4>
