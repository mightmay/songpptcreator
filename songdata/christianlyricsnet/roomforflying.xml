		<segment1>Settle down. It's time to make my move. A sunny sky. Another day with you. It's closer now than ever was. I'm letting go of everything so</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. She's got room for flying. Captures almost everything she tries for. She's got room for flying. Captures your soul, she's around you. She won't hurt you at all.</segment2>
		<segment3>A troubled mind'. Is more than I could lose. And more than once. It's tried to foil my mood. It's closer now than ever was. Another sign I'm yet to find but</segment3>
		<segment4>She's got room for flying. Captures almost everything she tries for. She's got room for flying. Captures your soul, she's around you. She won't hurt you at all.    </segment4>
