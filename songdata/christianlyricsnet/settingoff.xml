		<segment1>Anchors away!. This extra weight is pulling down on me. It's drowning me. And now its overboard with the necessities</segment1>
		<segment2>There's no room for you to come aboard</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I'm setting off, setting off to sea. In a boat that's filled from bow to stern. Of things that I don't need. The smallest waves are crashing over me. Soon my muffled cries as I capsize. Will be all that's left </segment3>
		<segment4>My problems always lie. In failed attempts to hide. The ways that I rely. On my dumb luck</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh God, I feel my grip. Begin to slowly slip. And now this sinking ship's. As good as sunk</segment5>
		<segment6>There's no room for you to come aboard. So just wait right here till I return to shore</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus: I'm setting off, setting off to sea. In a boat that's filled from bow to stern. Of things that I don't need. The smallest waves are crashing over me. Soon my muffled cries as I capsize. Will be all that's left of me</segment7>
		<segment8>Anchors away!. I can't take this extra weight. It's pulling down on me. It's pulling down on me</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus: I'm setting off, setting off to sea. In a boat that's filled from bow to stern. Of things that I don't need. The smallest waves are crashing over me. Soon my muffled cries as I capsize. Will be all that's left    </segment9>
