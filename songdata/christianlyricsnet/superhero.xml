		<segment1>Put your glasses on. Blend into the crowd. Cause you know you're different. And you're scared to make a sound. Will they take you in. You're the alien. But it's for a greater cause. Than they can understand. The world needs a superhero. Will you let your gift hide. For the sake of your pride. Will you live your life and amount to zero. The world needs a superhero. Will you take to the sky. In the blink of an eye. Will you give your life Superhero. Now you must decide. What life you will live. Are you making history. Or will you be a myth. Time is running out. Will you face the truth. I can see it in your eyes. So go find your phone booth. Will you save the day Will you save the day. The world is calling out, will you pretend it's all okay. Will you save the day Will you save the day. Show them what you're made of.. They are waiting.. Fly away    </segment1>
