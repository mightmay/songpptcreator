		<segment1>What good is it to gain the whole world, but lose your soul?. What good is it to make a sweet sound, but remain proud?. In view of Gods mercy, I offer my all</segment1>
		<segment2>. And take my life, let it be everything, all of me. Here I am, use me for Your glory. In everything I say and do, let my life honor You. Here I am living for Your glory</segment2>
		<segment3>. The road Im on that leads nowhere without You. And the life I live that finds meaning and surrender. In view of Gods mercy, I offer my all</segment3>
		<segment4>. Seeking first the Kingdom. Seeking first the Kingdom of my Lord     </segment4>
