		<segment1>Saw you the other day. When you passed my way. I had to do a double take. Something in your smile. There was something in your eyes. And I could tell there'd been a change</segment1>
		<segment2>And it is such a miracle, what God has brought you through. And everything about you is just shouting out the proof</segment2>
		<segment3>There's something different about you. There's something different about you. I see God's love in your heart. And He's making you shine. There's something different about you. There's something different about you. You got God's love in your heart. And He's making you shine. There's something different about you</segment3>
		<segment4>I just can't help myself. I get so overwhelmed. Every time I look around. To see your love outrageous. So contagious, where you were. And where you faith is taking you now</segment4>
		<segment5>Higher than you've ever dreamed you could ever be before. And I knew it the moment that you walked right through the door</segment5>
		<segment6>So go and tell the good things that Jesus has done. Let every moment be your moment to tell everyone, yeah. Something different, something different. Something different, different about you. Something different, something different. Something different, yeah     </segment6>
