		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on Philippians 2:9-10</segment1>
		<segment2>Some men called Him Rabbi, good teacher, nothing more. The Son of just a carpenter who taught along the shore. Some men called Him Master, Elijah come again. Some left their nets to follow Him to learn to fish for men. Some say He's Messiah, I Am, who's always been. The Baptist called Him Lamb of God who takes away our sin </segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). What's in a name that the demons flee. What's in a name that the captives go free. What's in a name that every knee should bow. In the name of Jesus, name above all names. There is power and glory, forever and ever. Forever and ever </segment3>
		<segment4>Some said Son of David returning to His throne. Some said He's the Son of Man with origin unknown. And one said He's the Son of God, the Rock on which we stand. The Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end </segment4>
		<segment5>No other name can sound so sweet. No other name is so complete. No other name can bring release. The Mighty God, the Prince of Peace    </segment5>
