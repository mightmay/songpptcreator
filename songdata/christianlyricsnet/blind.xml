		<segment1>Each and every single day. I was throwing life away with questions. Searching for a better way. Always looking in the wrong direction</segment1>
		<segment2>My heart I could not trust. Cause it lies to me too much. And my mind just couldn't. Understand it all </segment2>
		<segment3>How could I have been so blind to not see you. The more that I look the more I find. You've led me to the truth. That I am nothing if I'm without you. You opened my eyes and helped me to find. How could I have been so blind</segment3>
		<segment4>I have fallen once again. Evidently made the wrong decision. Stumbling in the dark. Now I need you here to be my vision</segment4>
		<segment5>My heart I cannot trust. Cause it lies to me too much. And my mind just cannot. Understand it all </segment5>
		<segment6>You took my heart and you changed it. With your words of life. You took my eyes and you opened them. And gave me sight    </segment6>
