		<segment1>I can feel it coming over me . All the weight of what this fear can bring . I know on my own I cant survive and Im fading fast now . Im closing in on whats in store for me . All the rest in your security . Im holding on to the words you speak . And youre speaking clear now . . Im running fast to seek your face . Head first I dive into your grace . You are My Fortress, . You are the refuge where I hide . You are the strength when I cant fight . You are the only one I rest my life in . You are the only hope I find . You are my only peace of mind . You are the only one I rest my life in . . Im taking hold of whats in front of me . A place where I can rest my weary feet . Theres no other place that I can go . So Im waiting here now . Im letting go what the world will bring . A sanctuary that will never breathe . I found my heart in that place before . But Ill never go back . . Im running fast to seek your face . Head first I dive into your grace . You are my fortress . You are the refuge where I hide. . You are the strength when I cant fight . You are the only one I rest my life in . You are the only hope I find . You are my only peace of mind . You are the only one I rest my life in . . I get lost within that place . The place where Ill always wish I stay, oh . . Oh, You are my fortress, . You are the refuge . You are the only hope I find . You are the only one I rest my life in, oh . You are my fortress . You are the refuge . You are my only peace of mind . You are the only one I rest my life in . Oh, You are the only one . Only one I rest my life in Lord . You are my hope . My strength, my life, my peace . My rock, my joy, my everything now, oh . You are the refuge where I hide . You are the only one I rest my life in      </segment1>
