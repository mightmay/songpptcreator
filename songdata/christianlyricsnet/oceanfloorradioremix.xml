		<segment1>the mistakes I've made. that caused pain. I could have done without</segment1>
		<segment2>all my selfish thoughts. all my pride. the things I hid. you have forgot about</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). they're all behind you. they'll never find you. they're on the ocean floor. your sins are forgotten. they're on the bottom. of the ocean floor</segment3>
		<segment4>my misdeeds. all my greed. all the things that haunt me now. they're not a pretty sight to see. but they're wiped away. by a mighty, mighty wave. a mighty, mighty wave</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>your sins are erased. and they are no more. they're out on the ocean floor </segment6>
		<segment7>take them away. to return no more. take them away. to the ocean floor. to the ocean floor. to the ocean floor</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus x2)</segment8>
		<segment9>your sins are erased. and they are no more. they're out on the ocean floor     </segment9>
