		<segment1>I'm laying it all out on the table, I'm telling you again what I've already told you before: My love is not a soon forgotten fable;. My heart is not a box with a lock in a five and dime store.</segment1>
		<segment2>So there's no need to question me and my feelings. Oh, wondering if I am sure. Ask me again, and I'll tell you the same, Over and over.</segment2>
		<segment3>Sure enough to never want to be without you, Sure enough, to stay for good, Sure enough in every little thing about you, Sure enough.</segment3>
		<segment4>Developing the art of collaboration, It's dinner and a movie and a baby or two. Now we are in the midst of a revelation, mm-hmm, We're doing what a modern world said we could not do.</segment4>
		<segment5>And even when our love is mellow and aging, Oh, even when we're old and wise, And we know then what we don't know now, Well, I know I'll still be</segment5>
		<segment6>Sure enough to never want to be without you, Sure enough, to stay for good, Sure enough in every little thing about you, Sure enough.</segment6>
		<segment7>(ah, ha..that's good.)</segment7>
		<segment8>Sure enough to never want to be without you, Sure enough to stay for good, oh, Sure enough in every little thing about you, Sure enough.</segment8>
		<segment9>Sure enough to never want to be without you, Sure enough to stay for good, Sure enough in every little thing about you, Sure enough.</segment9>
		<segment10>You know how..</segment10>
		<segment11>Sure enough to never want to be without you, Sure enough, oh, to stay for good, Sure enough in every little thing about you, Sure enough.    </segment11>
