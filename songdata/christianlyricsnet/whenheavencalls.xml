		<segment1>Much faster then, The blink of an eye. Lightening will flash. And he'll split the sky. Nobody knows. The day or the time. The trumpet will sound. And we will arise</segment1>
		<segment2>When heaven calls. This life is over. We'll stand before. Our God and savior. When heaven calls. We must be ready. To trade these mortal things. For immortality. When heaven calls</segment2>
		<segment3>For every man. There is a time. To love and to laugh, To live and to die. So i'm living for. The one who is love. And i'm dying to hear. Hear him say well done.</segment3>
		<segment4>When heaven calls. This life is over. I'll stand before. My God and Savior. When heaven calls. I will be ready. To trade these mortal things. For immortality. When heaven calls</segment4>
