		<segment1>As I look at the world. I begin to dream of the future. What's next to be. Your love so strong for everyone. You made us all in Your image</segment1>
		<segment2>And You saved the day. When Jesus came. And You took away all my sin and shame. And You made us right again</segment2>
		<segment3>You came from God above. The Father's only Son. Saved my soul. Made me new. Now I live for You</segment3>
		<segment4>My heart is alive and my spirit free. In the Saviour. Gave His life for me. By Your Word. We will be the light of the world. My Father. Shine Your light in me</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll stand on the Word. Be a light in the world. When Your praises are heard. We'll be singing    </segment5>
