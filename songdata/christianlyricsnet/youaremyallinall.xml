		<segment1>You are my strength when I am weak. You are the treasure that I seek. You are my all in all</segment1>
		<segment2>Seeking You as a precious jewel. Lord to give up I'd be a fool. You are my all in all</segment2>
		<segment3>Jesus Lamb of God worthy is your name. Jesus Lamb of God worthy is your name</segment3>
		<segment4>Taking my sin my cross my shame. Rising again I bless your name. You are my all in all. When I fall down you pick me up. When I am dry You fill my cup. You are my all in all      </segment4>
