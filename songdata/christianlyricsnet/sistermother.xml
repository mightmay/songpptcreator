		<segment1>My life is plagued. By mistakes, broken love, slaps in the face. But I'm trying to care, to dare to embrace your face</segment1>
		<segment2>Hug him like a brother. Kiss her like a sister. Let it be my mother for now</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to find where the maid in the street. Is pouring her wine. I heard she takes you in and gives you the words. You need said</segment3>
		<segment4>If you'll be her brother. She'll kiss you like a sister. She'll even be your mother for now</segment4>
		<segment5>Hug him like a brother. Kiss her like a sister. Let it be my mother. Let it be my father. I will be her brother. Kiss her like a sister. Come and be my mother forever    </segment5>
