		<segment1>So you thought you had to keep this up. All the work that you do. So we think that you're good. And you can't believe it's not enough. All the walls you built up. Are just glass on the outside</segment1>
		<segment2>So let 'em fall down. There's freedom waiting in the sound. When you let your walls fall to the ground. We're here now</segment2>
		<segment3>This is where the healing begins, oh. This is where the healing starts. When you come to where you're broken within. The light meets the dark. The light meets the dark</segment3>
		<segment4>Afraid to let your secrets out. Everything that you hide. Can come crashing through the door now. But too scared to face all your fear. So you hide but you find. That the shame won't disappear</segment4>
		<segment5>So let it fall down. There's freedom waiting in the sound. When you let your walls fall to the ground. We're here now. We're here now, oh</segment5>
		<segment6>This is where the healing begins, oh. This is where the healing starts. When you come to where you're broken within. The light meets the dark. The light meets the dark</segment6>
		<segment7>Sparks will fly as grace collides. With the dark inside of us. So please don't fight. This coming light. Let this blood come cover us. His blood can cover us</segment7>
		<segment8>This is where the healing begins, oh. This is where the healing starts. When you come to where you're broken within. The light meets the dark. The light meets the dark    </segment8>
