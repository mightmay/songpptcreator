		<segment1>As I stand here in your presence, Of your beauty I will always stand in awe, I reach my hands out to the heavens, yeah, And I lift my voice to you alone, To you alone, </segment1>
		<segment2>As I bow my head before you, I lay my burdens down at your nail pierced feet, Every ounce of you radiates your glory, With you I know that I'm complete </segment2>
		<segment3>And I sing Hallelujah, You are my God, Maker of the heavens, Hallelujah, You are my LORD, I bow before your presence, </segment3>
		<segment4>As I stand here in your presence, Of your beauty I will always stand in awe, I reach my hands out to the heavens, yeah, And I lift my voice to you alone, And I sing Hallelujah, You are my God, Maker of the heavens, Hallelujah, You the LORD of all, Maker of all the heavens, I can only kneel before your presence, All the nations praise your Holy Name, You are the great I Am, More than I can reason, I realize more that I am needing you, </segment4>
