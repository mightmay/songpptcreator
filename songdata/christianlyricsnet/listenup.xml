		<segment1>Why are you crying. Did I say something wrong. Werent we just talking. Tell me whats going on</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause Im pretty sure my intentions. Were nothing more than conversation. Maybe you just needed someone. To listen to your heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe I spoke too soon. Maybe I said too much. Now that my face is blue. Think its time I listen up. Ive already said enough</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes I do this. Thing is Im so afraid. When it gets quiet. What you might have to say</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause Im guilty of. Overcompensation. Im lost in my. Own translation. I apologize, I know I. Should listen to your heart</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>There isnt anything that I could say. Not a word to get in the way. Of you, Of You, I am listening</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
