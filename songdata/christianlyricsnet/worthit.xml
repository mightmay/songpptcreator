		<segment1>Love's not a feeling. Love's not convenient. But I know love will change your life. Love takes sacrifice. Love cuts like a knife. Sometimes love will make you cry. Love's not easy. But it's worth it. Love is a hunger. But love won't leave you empty. See it's the language of the heart. Love can steal your pride. But love won't let you hide. It takes everything you've got. Love's not easy. But it's worth it. What you gonna do when the bottom falls out. And you're left with nothing but your fear and your doubt to hold to. Who will hold you?. Where you gonna run when it's all on the line. And you're looking for someone to save your life. To save your life. Love can hear you. Love can heal you. If you let it inside. Oh, remember now. Love's not easy. But it's worth it. What you gonna do when the bottom falls out. And you're left with nothing but your fear and doubt to hold to. Who's gonna hold you?. Oh, where you gonna run when it's all on the line. And you're looking for somone to save your life. To save your life. Love can hear you. I know love will heal you. If you let it inside. Oh, remember now. Love's not easy. But it's worth it    </segment1>
