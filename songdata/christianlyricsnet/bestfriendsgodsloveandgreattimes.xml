		<segment1>Halfway between your house and mine. Stood a weeping willow tree. If God ever made a tree to climb. Well, He build that one. Just for you and me. It was so easy climbing up. The trick was to not look down</segment1>
		<segment2>In the time it takes to turn around. You find that promises are hard to keep. Like the ones we made when we were young. About how we'd stay together and never leave</segment2>
		<segment3>But little ones run out of time. There are much bigger trees to climb. And friends like you are hard to find</segment3>
		<segment4>Wherever in the world you are tonight. I pray that you are warm and safe and dry. And if you ever think of me. I hope these things things cross your mind. Best friends, God's love, and great times</segment4>
		<segment5>Last night I was out for a drive. And I remembered that willow tree. And how we'd laugh until we'd cry. And how that innocence has abandoned me. The greatest joys from the simplest things. The truth was the only thing we believed. Now I'm learning from the memory</segment5>
		<segment6>Wherever in the world you are tonight. I pray that you are warm and safe and dry. Wherever in the world you are tonight. I wanted you to know. That I'm alright</segment6>
		<segment7>And if you ever think of me. I hope these things cross your mind. Best friends, God's love, and great times    </segment7>
