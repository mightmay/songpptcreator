		<segment1>The marionette has your number. Pulling your arms and legs till you can't stand on your own. Dragging you conscience on the stage. And your heart gets rearranged, And you cannot tell your mentor from your Maker. Look at the crowds bleeding with laughter. Over the way you entertain at beckon call. They don't see behind the lights or the painted background. They just like to see you fall </segment1>
		<segment2>And you don't really mind. And you're just wasting time. And you don't feel anything. You're a boy on a string </segment2>
		<segment3>I feel a sadness like Gapetto. Watching the life that he created run away, Seeing the puppeteer's intrusion. And holding the remains of puppets that had rotted away. One day the curtain will not open. And all of the crowds will go away. But sometimes those strings will choke you. But until that day </segment3>
		<segment4>No you won't really mind. And you're just wasting time. And you don't feel anything. You're a boy on a string </segment4>
		<segment5>And you don't really mind. And you're just wasting time. And you don't feel anything. You're a boy on a string.     </segment5>
