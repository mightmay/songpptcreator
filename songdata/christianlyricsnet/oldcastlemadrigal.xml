		<segment1>Fairest and majestic kind. Draped in royalty and prose. Mountains born from youthful forests. Cauldrons bore legends</segment1>
		<segment2>Holy and sacred are these. Old scrolls and pages. Of blood and offering. Of our Lord. All kings and kingdoms bow. In due accordance. The song of saints foretell. Of all His goodness</segment2>
		<segment3>Enchantments from Old Castle. Lore entwines the namesake of. Every creature cast asunder. Bearing the serpent</segment3>
		<segment4>Holy and sacred are these. Old scrolls and pages. Of blood and offering. Of our Lord. All kings and kingdoms bow. In due accordance. The song of saints foretell. Of all His goodness</segment4>
		<segment5>Henceforth doth divinity. Purge the conjurer and role. Songs of fancy root in hemlock. Perfume of devils    </segment5>
