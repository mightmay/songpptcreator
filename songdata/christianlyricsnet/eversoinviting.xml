		<segment1>The time has come for you to sit this out. To fit inside your mold. Would be to sell myself short</segment1>
		<segment2>This ground we tread upon. Is now filling up to our necks. We turn the pages left to right. We see everything</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, my story's growing, it is on my last request. Don't make me feel so contradicting. There's no room for cheating and being yourself. Failure leaves such a bitter taste in their mouth</segment3>
		<segment4>And on the last hour. We write so many new chapters again. And on the outside. Where there are no surprises</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, it's getting longer. To see it through their eyes. Would bring me so much closer. You can do this night after night. Failure leaves such a bitter taste in my mouth</segment5>
		<segment6>Taste and see, I swear I know what's good. Be still and know that they won't lie to you every single time you're facing lies. I know why you never take your eyes off me. I've used my lungs for everything but breathing</segment6>
		<segment7>I find myself dried up in this conversation. So pull me out, pull me aside    </segment7>
