		<segment1>On the outside all we see is clay that hides the perfect lie. But no one really knows the pain inside. I understand how much it hurts to be the one whos never seen. Missing pages in a magazine </segment1>
		<segment2>No one knows you anymore. Youre lost inside the walls youve built. No one knows you anymore. A prison deep within your soul. There is One who sees it all. Hell give you life youve never dreamed. He can see the pain underneath your skin </segment2>
		<segment3>Its hard to see you fading. Nothing that I do can bring you back. I pray to God that you dont fade away. Your addiction is a symptom of a lost and dying soul. Without Jesus theres no hope at all </segment3>
		<segment4>No one knows you anymore. Youre lost inside the walls youve built. No one knows you anymore. A prison deep within your soul. There is One who sees it all. Hell give you life youve never dreamed. He can see the pain underneath your skin </segment4>
		<segment5>Theres so much more this is not the end. Its all in your hands dont throw it away. A beautiful life with so much to give. The image of God underneath your skin </segment5>
		<segment6>No one knows you anymore. Youre lost inside the walls youve built. No one knows you anymore. A prison deep within your soul. There is One who sees it all. Hell give you life youve never dreamed. He can see the pain underneath your skin </segment6>
		<segment7>Beauty of God underneath your skin. Beauty of God underneath your skin. Beauty of God underneath your skin     </segment7>
