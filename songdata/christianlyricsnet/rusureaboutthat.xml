		<segment1>Chorus: Can you try to hide what's in your heart. What's on your mind. Can you carry on like nothing's wrong. Go on and on?. Are you sure about that?</segment1>
		<segment2>You've been pushed, you've been shoved. You've been left and unloved. Oh, why do you stay. So many tears that you cry every night. But ya know your life doesnt have to be this way. But you've got hurts deep inside you feel. It's only right that someone should pay. You can't forget all the scars he left on your heart. All the promises he made</segment2>
		<segment3>You've got to let it out, girl. Got to let it go. You've got to give it up, got to give. it up if you really want to know. The truth about life, girl. The secret of love is living inside you. It's dying to break through the walls around your heart</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>You've been up, you've been down. You've been all around. You broke all the rules. It was good for a while, you hid behind a smile. But now you're broken and you're bruised. Have you ever considered that life is an invitation for you. To decide in your mind, to accept or decline the reality of truth. You've got to let it out, boy. Got to let it go. Got to give it up, got to give it if you really want to know. The truth about life, boy, the secret of love. You've done it your way for so long, so tell me now. When's enough .. enough</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Life's been hard, now don't get me wrong. It's hard to fine someone you can count on. I know that you wanna be strong. But anyone can play it tough. You may have yourself, but is that enough    </segment7>
