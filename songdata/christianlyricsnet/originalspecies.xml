		<segment1>Now my heart and mind agree. a super natural selected me. I see a plan so grandiose. my very own Galapagos. God laid down and he began to trace. an image that he could embrace. then He smiled down on His plan. and from the dust He made a man</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm an original species. more enlightened than Nietzshe. I'm sure you'd like to meet me. I am loved. by the maker who's so clever. I was made to live forever. though my body turns to sand. my soul is in His hands</segment2>
		<segment3>A breakthrough theory of origin. a simple truth that's always been. fingerprints have been left behind. that point us to a master mind. Stars in the sky. there to please my eye. the cosmos in His command. but He has time to hold my hand.    </segment3>
