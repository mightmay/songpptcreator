		<segment1>I feel so weightless. Nothing inside is keeping me grounded. My self-decay brings tears to my eyes. Fingerprints of the dead descend on my window. I feel it's all I see, I feel it's breaking me. Haunting words of emptiness </segment1>
		<segment2>(I'm not afraid) I'm not afraid, so take me. So take me, I feel it's breaking me. (I'm not afraid) I'm not afraid, so take me. So take me, I'm dead inside, so save me </segment2>
		<segment3>As a new campaign marches across the dead. In uniform with one vision: Delivering Our Children. Each step making a sound of reason. Breaking and burning caskets. Marching across the dead </segment3>
		<segment4>(I'm not afraid) I'm not afraid, so take me. So take me, I feel it's breaking me. (I'm not afraid) I'm not afraid, so take me. So take me, I'm dead inside, so save me.     </segment4>
