		<segment1>Here is love vast as the ocean, Loving kindness as the flood, When the Prince of Life, our ransom. Shed for us his precious blood. Who his love will not remember, Who can cease to sing his praise?. He will never be forgotten. Throughout heaven's eternal days. </segment1>
		<segment2>On the mount of crucifixion. Fountains opened deep and wide, Through the floodgates of God's mercy. Flowed a vast and gracious tide. Grace and love, like mighty rivers. Poured incessant from above. And heaven's peace and perfect justice. Kissed a guilty world in love.    </segment2>
