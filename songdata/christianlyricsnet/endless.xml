		<segment1>No more lies this time around. You hate it. 'Cause even love you thought you found. Has faded. And lately it all seems temporary to you</segment1>
		<segment2>How could you know. That you'e going down a road. That's endless, endless. Is it ever enough. When you're looking for a love. That's endless, endless</segment2>
		<segment3>Tired of living for yourself. It's empty. But how could you be someone else. You can't be. And maybe life is more than chasing the wind</segment3>
		<segment4>Love calls out in the darkness. Always seeking the heart of. The wanderers, the wanderers like you, like me    </segment4>
