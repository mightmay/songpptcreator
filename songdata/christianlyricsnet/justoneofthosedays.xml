		<segment1>Woke up to the pouring rain. Stumbled out of bed with half a brain. Twenty minutes late for work again. But it's alright, it's alright. No time for coffee, gotta hit the door. Grab a shirt from off the floor. Never noticed it was stained before. But it's alright, it's alright. Oh, but nothing's gonna bring me down. No, not now</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. It's just one of those days. When everything's right. God is in his heaven and I'm walking in the light. So hallelujah anyway. It's just one of those days. You look at the sky. Throw your hands up and you laugh at life. So hallelujah, Lord be praised. It's just one of those days</segment2>
		<segment3>The boss callsyeah, I know I'm late. I had a flat on the interstate. Tell the man that he can wait. Don't get uptight, it's alright. Hold onthere's another call for me. No, I didn't buy a diamond ring. Somebody stole my identity. Hey it's alright, it's alright. Oh, but nothing's gonna lay me low. Cause I know</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. So come on rain, lightning strike. Just you try to shake my life. You got no power, you got no hold. Cause it is well with my soul</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS. So hallelujah, Lord be praised. It's just one of those days    </segment5>
