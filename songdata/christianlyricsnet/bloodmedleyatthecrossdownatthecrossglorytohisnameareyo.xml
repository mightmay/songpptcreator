		<segment1>Down at the cross, Where my savior died;. Down where for cleansing. from sin I cried, There to my heart. was the blood applied;. Singin... GLORY TO HIS NAME!!!!. I am so wondrously. saved from my sin, Jesus so sweetly. abides within;. There at the cross. where He took me in. Singin.. GLORY TO HIS NAME!!!!. Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin, I am so glad I have entered in;. There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;. Singin.. GLORY TO HIS NAME!!!!. GLORY TO HIS NAME. PRECIOUS NAME. GLORY TO HIS NAME. THERE TO MY HEART WAS THE BLOOD APPLIED. GLORY TO HIS NAME!!!!. Come to this so rich and sweet, Cast thy poor soul at thy savior's feet;. If you plunge in today, you'll be made comlpete;. Singin.. GLORY TO HIS NAME!!!    </segment1>
