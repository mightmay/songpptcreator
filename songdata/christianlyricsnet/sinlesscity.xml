		<segment1>In this sinless city, we wear calluses on our hands. From empty, vain hand-shaking, we see the guilt has left again. And all will fall, with or without our good will. So we fool them all, who pray for those who never will. </segment1>
		<segment2>And we both let go. </segment2>
		<segment3>Never been much for pity. Never been much for wishing them well. But I cant help but sever the ties they tied so tight, so well. And on one side theyre holding on to what we were. And here we are, holding the hands that we severed. </segment3>
		<segment4>And we both let go. </segment4>
		<segment5>The fire burns like cancer. The scarring lasts forever. We all play tricks on fools that see us as their sinless answer. </segment5>
		<segment6>And over and over again. </segment6>
		<segment7>Dont say this isnt what youre used to. Ive seen followers like you. Ive let down followers like you. </segment7>
		<segment8>The fire burns like cancer. The scarring lasts forever. We all play tricks on fools that see us as their sinless answer.     </segment8>
