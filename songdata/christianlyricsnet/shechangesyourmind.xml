		<segment1>She changes your mind when you see the joy in her eyes. It makes you feel. She draws your eyes from all the things that have made you numb and makes you feel. If I could open up my heart and let her out I would never have to sing her name aloud. It was your &quot;hello&quot; that kept me hanging on every word. and you &quot;good-bye&quot; that keeps me listening for your voice around each corner. I'll sing songs to help me stay up all night. I don't want to go to sleep. I'll sing songs and hope you're listening carefully and know exactly what I mean. It's the song you must seek out when your night has just begun. In the distance you can find the lips from which was sung a melody.    </segment1>
