		<segment1>Am I sleeping with my eyes wide?. Am I alone?. Am I staring into bright lights?. Have I gone home?</segment1>
		<segment2>I must be dremaing when I'm sitting here in someone elses throne.</segment2>
		<segment3>Am I sleeping with my eyes wide. Won't you let me know?</segment3>
		<segment4>Will I wake to find you waiting by my bedside?. Will I wake to find you waiting by my side?</segment4>
		<segment5>Am I sleeping with my eyes wide?. Am I alone?. Am I staring into bright lights?. Have I gone home?</segment5>
		<segment6>I want to see your hairline. And cheek bones. And red lips. And cell phone. Won't you let me know?</segment6>
		<segment7>Will I wake to find you waiting by my bedside?. Will I wake to find you waiting by my side?    </segment7>
