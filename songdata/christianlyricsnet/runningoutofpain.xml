		<segment1>As he raises his hand you begin to understand. That no love is worth the hate that you feel. Now you're running out of pain. And all these feelings feel the same. So you close your eyes and wish it all away</segment1>
		<segment2>And I lie awake and I try to say. Anything I know just to ease your pain. But you hide away where no one can see. And it's only you that can set you free</segment2>
		<segment3>Now the time has come again. So you reach deep down within. To find the strength that you have buried there. As you turn to walk away you can still hear him say. You'll never make it in this world alone</segment3>
		<segment4>You try to fight (you try to fight). You hide the pain (you hide the pain). You walk away (never again)    </segment4>
