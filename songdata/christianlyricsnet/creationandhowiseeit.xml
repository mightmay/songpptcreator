		<segment1>&quot;I am the kind of man who wants to watch the world burn. I hold the match that will spark it's destruction, And burn out the liars, traitors, spies. That live under the protection of your name. Unfortunate, pathetic fools. They scorch the earth with fire from their mouths. I've felt your wrath. Let's explore mine. By sundown, you and I will be all that's left. If I'm to feel alone. I'll make it that way. In the clutches of death, I'll stand at the center circle of a burning town and smile. Unfortunate, pathetic fools. There will be a slaughter of those untrue. The fate of the world is held by the throat with my two hands.&quot;    </segment1>
