		<segment1>Everyday we keep on pushing on. Knowing we can only push so far. Is it hard enough, is it hard enough. Hard enough.</segment1>
		<segment2>Gentle breezes slowly failing me. Still we level everything we see. Is it hard enough, is it hard enough. Hard enough.</segment2>
		<segment3>Blinding lights, a road ahead. Is it real to me or in my head, And I can see what we all held on to. What do you hold on to?</segment3>
		<segment4>When we believed that we could. When we believed that we should. When we believed in the way we used to be.     </segment4>
