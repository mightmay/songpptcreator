		<segment1>Pour the oil on troubled waters. Come around lay down arms. Rest between the pure in heart and persecuted. Sound alarms to make calm. Mend the fence convincing some. The Spirit's sense of mercy. Live the Gospel and the Gospel is His peace</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, Oh, Oh</segment2>
		<segment3>Heal the breach and reach out. With the olive branch, allay fear. Live the seventh blessing and expect. To be an heir of God. Meet halfway to pacify. The longing with an answer. Live the Gospel and the Gospel is His peace</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, Oh, Oh</segment4>
		<segment5>For a kiss from Holiness. Discovering the dove lights only when our hearts agree. There is reverence in this. The offering of heart's ease for a spiritual wave of peace</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, Oh, Oh.     </segment6>
