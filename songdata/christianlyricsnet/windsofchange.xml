		<segment1>Can you feel the pains in life?. Wrapped around you like they're chains. Restricting all your dreams. Do you wonder if there is a way? </segment1>
		<segment2>A way to set you free. Set you free </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS:]. So tell me all your dreams. Tell me all your fears and what you're longing for the most. It's not another way that'll end up the same for it's under my control </segment3>
		<segment4>Do you feel the winds of change. Soon this weight will fall away. And take you to a place. Only found through these winds of change </segment4>
		<segment5>A breeze that's new and free. New and free </segment5>
		<segment6>I'll be the one who you can cry to. The one who will give you wings. I will give wings </segment6>
		<segment7>[BRIDGE:]. Someday we'll sail away. Mounted up on wings like eagles. We will run and will not fade away.     </segment7>
