		<segment1>She like the boys with the black hearts. She got an eye ta match. Tattoo on her neck says, &quot;Burn bright and fast!&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>She's a star, man. Just ask her. Light you up and take you down in flames. Tell the truth, I'm still laughing. But maybe she's your thing.</segment2>
		<segment3>She comes late if she comes at all. Don't you know her name?. Picture on the bathroom wall. Jones' hall of fame!    </segment3>
