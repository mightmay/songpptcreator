		<segment1>Have I become, a target that some people. can't resist?. My flaws have become a greater risk. If my name is a synonym to love and. happiness then why am I bombarded. with distress?. My old friends, haven't seen them since I. don't know when. But I can send them a signed 8 by 10. My sweetheart, she understands why I'm away. but still it gets harder every day</segment1>
		<segment2>But it's my delight, to sing all night. till the sun comes up again</segment2>
		<segment3>After all my cross isn't hard to bear. it is heavy, I am weak, but you are there. There are times when I am down and. feel undone. You pursue me like I am your only son. My old flaws you've overlooked and put to rest. They're farther than the East is from the West</segment3>
		<segment4>But it's my delight, to sing all night. till the sun comes up again. Yes it's my delight, to share a flicker. of your light. Just a ray of hope to a friend</segment4>
		<segment5>I've spent about 24 hours in a flying J. truck stop. I haven't had a shower and 'bout to drop. It really doesn't matter if we make it all up</segment5>
		<segment6>If it wasn't for the lighthouse. where would my life be?. On a ship bound for nowhere. on an unforgiving sea. I thank God. If it wasn't for the lighthouse. where would my life be?. On a ship bound for nowhere. on an unforgiving sea. I thank God for the lighthouse. I thank God for the light.    </segment6>
