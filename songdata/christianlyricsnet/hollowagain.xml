		<segment1>Somehow I lost my way. And now it's clear to me. All that I fought so hard to keep. Is all I had to leave</segment1>
		<segment2>I know you can't hear me. And you won't believe me. But there is something I must say here. Before I fade away</segment2>
		<segment3>(This is the world endsagain)</segment3>
		<segment4>Forever we will be. Forever we will be hollow. Hollow again</segment4>
		<segment5>So I'm left here waiting. So long I'm contemplating. And now I know how it is. But now it's far too late</segment5>
		<segment6>How will we open the eyes of the dead. When we are hollow. Hollow</segment6>
		<segment7>And all along here I was told. By fallen men in their charade. That we could find a hope inside. The safety of this empty place    </segment7>
