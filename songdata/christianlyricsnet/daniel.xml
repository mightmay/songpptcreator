		<segment1>Daniel's with lions tonight in a cave. I can see their red pale eyes testin his faith. Oh, and I can see Daniel waitin' to die. God, it looks like Daniel -- won't be around in my life. They say its a pity though I can't intervene. Daniel, just was the best slave who ever served this king. Oh, and, even so, I can't change the law. Lord, I'll miss Daniel --  Oh, I'll miss him so much. Oh oh oh -- Daniel, my governor. You are bolder than me -- do you still feel so brave?. Are you more than a meal?. You're wise and kind -- but you face roarin' lions. Daniel, will they starve? Will your faith save your life?. LEAD. Oh oh oh -- Daniel, my governor. You are bolder than me -- will you still be the same. When tomorrow is here?. Will I start cryin' -- will you see mornin' light?. Daniel, it's so hard -- I'm afraid that you'll die. Daniel's with lions tonight in a cave. I can see an Israelite's just what they crave. Oh, and, I can see Daniel prayin' for life. God, if You like Daniel. Just stay around him tonight. Oh, God, if You like Daniel. Just keep him out of those lions.     </segment1>
