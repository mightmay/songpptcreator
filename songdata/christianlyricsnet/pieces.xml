		<segment1>In the starlight. The ground's shaking. And I don't know what to do. I try to run in. But I'm breaking. Will I ever make it through?. My pride, my weakness, the lies I tell. I still hide, my disguise can make me well</segment1>
		<segment2>Will You tear my world apart, rebuild it completely?. Will You reach for my breaking heart and hold it together?. Lord, come make me new. I give the pieces to You</segment2>
		<segment3>I never realized. What I was missing. When I had nothing to lose. Never lived life. 'Till I listened. And I really heard the truth. Through my lies. Through my weakness. My pride fell. I can't hide my life. You know me too well</segment3>
		<segment4>Will You tear my world apart, rebuild it completely?. Will You reach for my breaking heart, and hold it together?. Lord, come make me new. I give the pieces to You</segment4>
		<segment5>In Your hands. You're making me. Closer to free. And I believe. You put love in Your plans for me</segment5>
		<segment6>You tear my world apart. Will You reach for my breaking heart, yeah. Yeah. Yeah</segment6>
		<segment7>Will You tear my world apart, rebuild it completely?. Will You reach for my breaking heart, and hold it together?. Lord, come make me new. I give the pieces to You. Yeah. I give the pieces to You. Yeah. I give the pieces to You. To You. I give the pieces to You. To You. I give the pieces to You    </segment7>
