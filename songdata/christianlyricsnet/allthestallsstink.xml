		<segment1>All the stalls stink. Two bears, two pigs. I'll take one whiff. Before I get sick. Wallabes, rhinos. You'll see on my boat. Watch me straightening. The mess they're making. Save your raincoat. I will not go. Where's the Lysol?. Carry me soap. Na na na na na Noah na na na. Na na na na na Noah na na na. Hey guys, uhoh. There's a skunk, I know. She left the odor by the stairs. She likes to let me know she's scared. Save your raincoat. I will not go. Here's a nice thought. Camels need Scope. Na na na na na Noah na na na. Na na na na na Noah na na na. Save your raincoat. I will not go. Time to wipe off. A pair of hippos. Keep the boat still. I've been sorta ill. I might just throw up. In all this swill. Save your raincoat. I will not go. Worldwide flood. Very big boat. We should just chill. Trust the Lord still. And life will go on. Life will go on. I know it will     </segment1>
