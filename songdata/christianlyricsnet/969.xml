		<segment1>You got to learn a little history. Oldest man in Bible times. Name was called Methuselah. Was nine hundred and sixty-nine. We had some guys come close. Almost ran for a thousand yards. Didn't they quit till they got buried. They should've known it just was too hard. When we look back now. Those fellas seemed to live forever. And you just get annoyed. Yeah cause you don't wanna believe it. Those guys were blessed with such long lives. Ain't no use in explainin'. If you're gonna doubt the truth. Spent your life doubtin' the Bible. When it's the fountain of youth Â– yeah. Standin' knockin' on your door. He told ya you could live forever. I hope you understand. The truth is it's now or never. These are the last days of your life. That should be somethin' that sticks in your mind. Yeah, we're runnin' out of time. But the young forget that they need eternal life. To get somethin' that last forever -- forever -- Whoa! Yeah!. And all the time we're agin'. Look at every wrinkle comin' on. Some guys don't even live to be 16. Think about that while I end this song. Standin' knockin' on your door. He told you how to live forever. I hope you understand. Hebrews three says it's now or never. These are the last days of your life. That should be somethin' that sticks in your mind    </segment1>
