		<segment1>(I'm not the same anymore)</segment1>
		<segment2>This time I am falling further away?. Nothing has changed, nothing has changed like I said it. would. faster towards the ground. that's where they wait where they wait for they wait. for me. they enter my veins. feel them crawling through my skin. collecting my nerves that they feed to their children. i swear it has to stop 'cause there is nothing left to. give, nothing left to give</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll be the victor. I will destroy them</segment3>
		<segment4>I wanna watch them burn it down. so I can breathe again</segment4>
		<segment5>Inhale, 'cause after tonight I won't be the same. Exhale, exhale, to find my feet on the ground</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm not the same anymore. I'm not the same anymore. as I sink down into the floor. and the walls are caving in. and I don't believe in them anymore. Now, I try to balance my walk. I am coming down alone. and I have to get them out of my head</segment6>
		<segment7>I wanna watch them burn down so I can breathe again. I wanna watch them burn it down. so i can breathe again</segment7>
		<segment8>One breathe at a time, I'll be just fine 'cause I'll be. right on the inside. I steady my hands inside of my shell and wait till. their backs are turned. Oh, inside of my head where they thought they would win. but i got them right where I want them. pushed to either side, I'm burning them alive, I hear them begging and pleading.     </segment8>
