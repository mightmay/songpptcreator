		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman and John Elefante. Based on John 15:18, Philippians 1:28, Romans 8:37</segment1>
		<segment2>Look at the front page, turn on the tv. They fire another round at you and me. Their guns are loaded, they're taking aim. Nobody told them we're not all the same. No paranoia, nobody could. Just write it off as being Hollywood. The innuendo between the lines. Leaves no confusion 'bout what's on their minds </segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). I won't go underground. I won't turn and flee. I won't bow the knee. I won't go underground. I won't turn and hide from the rising tide. I won't go underground. I won't compromise what the world denies. I won't go underground. And I'm not ashamed of the cross I've claimed </segment3>
		<segment4>They're taking notes on what we say. You know they'd like to lock us all away. Can't stop the movement, can't make it slow. Persecution always makes us grow. They got my number, it's no surprise. I'm here and wearing no disguise. Bring on the lions and heat up the fire. It's not enough to stop this man's desire </segment4>
		<segment5>(2nd Chorus). I won't go underground. I won't turn and flee. I won't bow the knee. I won't go underground. I keep holding fast till the very last. I won't go underground. I will turn my cheek, I will boldly speak. I won't go underground. I am not ashamed of the cross I've claimed </segment5>
		<segment6>I know the Spirit behind this force. It's not surprising if you know the source. I pray for freedom for helpless ones. And I keep standing till the new day dawns </segment6>
		<segment7>And I won't lay low as the hatreds grow     </segment7>
