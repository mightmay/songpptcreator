		<segment1>
When I was a young child. You watched over me. You kept me safe inside your arms. And then you set me free</segment1>
		<segment2>So I flew away like a bird. Not knowing which way to go. The light you give me inside. It will always glow</segment2>
		<segment3>And I want to remember. All the times we shared . And I won't ever forget your face. You know your hands were always there</segment3>
		<segment4>And still you're strong when I'm weak. It never seems to fade. I can hear your voice here with me. Whenever I'm awake</segment4>
		<segment5>And I know you'll be there til the end. Until the end of time. Because you sacrificed it all. Just to give me life</segment5>
		<segment6>And I want to remember. All the times we shared. And I won't ever forget your face. You know your hands were always there. You made me the man I am. The man I am today. And for that I owe you everything</segment6>
		<segment7>It's been so long, I can't go on. Without you by my side
