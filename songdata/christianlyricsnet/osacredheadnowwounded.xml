		<segment1>O sacred Head, now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down, Now scornfully surrounded with thorns Thine only crown;. How pale Thou art with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn, How does that visage languish, which once was bright as morn!</segment1>
		<segment2>What Thou, my Lord, has suffered was all for sinners' gain;. Mine, mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain, Lo, here I fall, my Savior; 'tis I deserve Thy place;. Look on me with Thy favor, assist me with Thy grace. </segment2>
		<segment3>What language shall I borrow to thank Thee, dearest Friend, For this, Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end?. O make me Thine forever, and should I fainting be, Lord, let me never, never outlive my love to Thee.     </segment3>
