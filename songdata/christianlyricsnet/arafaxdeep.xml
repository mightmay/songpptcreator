		<segment1>When this water flows down from the side of. Only you. Can you take everything that I am holding on to tightly. And all this love it will crash just like you say. Cause your love it will wash hearts away. This time the world hurts, we're looking for words to say</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Show me your meaning of love. Show me the secrets to life. And I'll crash in the rain, Your love is all I need</segment2>
		<segment3>Can I change all I am, Can I build a legacy. When I see everything that it was. Was never what I needed?. When, when you take. Will you take my heart away?. Cause I need what you just have to say. This time the world hurts, we're looking for words to say</segment3>
		<segment4>When the window's closed, but the curtains blow. And the paintings done, you still see through. So will search my heart, I can rest my eyes. All this broken sight, Just can see You. When the window's closed but the curtain blows. And the paintings done, you still se through. When they stand surround, they all fight the rain. But I will see it's just a frame    </segment4>
