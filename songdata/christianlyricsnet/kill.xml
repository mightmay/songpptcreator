		<segment1>if i could get you into a frame. if i could figure you out. how truly would i really be. if my image of you was complete. i've been trying to fill the void. to reach out and touch your face. but i molded you after my taste. and created another cliche. with a human concept of what is fitting. i cannot get you into my frame. now i see but a poor reflection. then i'll see face to face. kill all my idols till thy kingdom come. kill all my idols and come quickly come.     </segment1>
