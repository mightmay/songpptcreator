		<segment1>Right now there's. Nothing left for me to. Say now you want me to. Go away heard it one to. Many times now it's. Swimming in your mind. You don't know how you. Should feel can't decide. If what's real is real how. Does the faith come so. Easily why believe in. What you can't see?. I feel so bad have I done. All I can? want to give. You more don't know. What I can have you ears. To hear what is said to you. Have you eyes to see. The light that's shining on. You    </segment1>
