		<segment1>Well I may not be the greatest man to walk this earth. But I know who is. And I may not amount to what you think is much. But I already do to Him. While people keep searching for answers. Looking for a light in the dark. I'm standing with the answer. Cause He is living in my heart</segment1>
		<segment2>In Christ I can do all things. In Christ I mount up on eagle's wings. In Christ I wait for a great reward. That I have in store. In Christ I have His righteousness. In Christ I have what I confess. In Christ I don't worry about all the rest. Cause everything I need to be is in Christ</segment2>
		<segment3>Well you might think that I'm sounding all too prideful. But let me tell you something true. The very one who lives inside of me right now. Wants to live inside of you. Instead of searching any longer. You can have peace today. You can take hold of the answer. Then you'll be able to say</segment3>
		<segment4>In Him we live and move. And in Him we have our being. As we all live in Him. Together we can sing    </segment4>
