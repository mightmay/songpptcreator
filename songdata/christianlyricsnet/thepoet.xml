		<segment1>It couldn't be more far from the truth. If you could do to me the things you would do. And I know you're on to me. I'm watching you wanting me. You hung down the rebels and punish them wrongfully. You came with fire and weapons to kill </segment1>
		<segment2>A warrior poet once said. You're not dead yet so live like you could be. A warrior poet said. Have no regrets when you're old. Have no regrets when you're old </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm not looking for you to be anything. But my ultimate enemy. So back off, you're not what I would prefer to see. When my body rots I still won't give you the courtesy. You came with fire for the last time </segment3>
		<segment4>A warrior poet once said. You're not dead yet so live like you could be. A warrior poet said. Have no regrets when you're old. Have no regrets when you're old </segment4>
		<segment5>When your body wants to run. But your heart knows you're better than that. The blood you spilled on battlefields. I promise you will not go unspent. Neither will I leave you stranded. The promise rings as our battle cry. You're never alone regardless of doubt. But faith comes so easy to some. Better luck next time, better luck next time. Watch as the teargas burns my eyes. It burns my eyes </segment5>
		<segment6>A warrior poet once said. You're not dead yet so live like you could be. A warrior poet said. Have no regrets when you're old. Have no regrets when you're    </segment6>
