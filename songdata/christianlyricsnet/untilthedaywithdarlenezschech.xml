		<segment1>When I walk through suffering. Let it be an offering. Like a fragrance rising. In the valley of shadow. Not to waste my sorrows. But to trust and follow</segment1>
		<segment2>Until the day. When you wipe away every tear. You will hold me, carry me. Till that day. When You take away every fear. No more suffering. Who can imagine</segment2>
		<segment3>So I'll trade my sorrows. For the joy of serving you. Sharing your tomorrow. With your comfort, comforting. Bringing hope from hope you bring. My whole life an offering</segment3>
		<segment4>Until the day. When You wipe away every tear. You will hold me, carry me. Till that day. When You take away every fear. No more suffering. Who can imagine that day</segment4>
