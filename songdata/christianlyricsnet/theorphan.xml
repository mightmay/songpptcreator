		<segment1>maybe I push when I'm meant to be still. maybe I take it all to personal. Jesus, how to reconcile. the joyful noise. the ancient land. the tug from some invisible hand. the dying mother weaving bulrushes. along the Nile </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: float her basket over the sea. here on a barren shore. we'll be waiting for. a tailwind to carry her (an) orphan's cry. don't you worry, child. I wrote a lullaby </segment2>
		<segment3>I try to settle, but I just pass through. a rain dog, gypsy. a wandering Jew. all those homes were not ours. then I slept one night. in Abraham's field. and dreamt there was no moon. the night he died. counting stars. Selah </segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus - </segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: building you a home. building you a home. building you a home. we're building you a home. Selah </segment5>
		<segment6>- Chorus - </segment6>
		<segment7>float her basket over the sea. here on a barren shore. we'll be waiting for. a tailwind to bring us your sweet cry. don't you worry, child. I'm gonna sing you a lullaby    </segment7>
