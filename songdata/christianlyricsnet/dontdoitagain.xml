		<segment1>*Don't Do It Again is the actual name of the song. *It's Never Enough is the name of the album</segment1>
		<segment2>. Can you hear yourself?. A saner man would run from the things. Coming out your mouth. Your voice is all barbed wire and it stings</segment2>
		<segment3>Dont do it again, girl, no. Dont get all crazy. And begin, girl, to think it over. Yeah its all inside your head</segment3>
		<segment4>Get your head checked out. Because youre psycho psycho. So when youre all worked out. Wont have to worry about you being loco</segment4>
		<segment5>Dont do it again, girl, no. Dont get all crazy. And begin, girl, to think it over. Yeah its all inside your head</segment5>
		<segment6>As the days go on. And you say, Dont worry. Dont complain, were all the same. But youre crazy</segment6>
		<segment7>Dont do it again, girl, no. Dont get all crazy. And begin, girl, to think it over. Yeah its all inside your head    </segment7>
