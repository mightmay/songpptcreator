		<segment1>&quot;Man of sorrows&quot;, what a name. For the son of God who came. Ruined sinners to reclaim. Hallelujah, what a Savior</segment1>
		<segment2>Bearing shame and scoffing rude. In my place condemned He stood. Sealed my pardon with His blood. Hallelujah, what a Savior</segment2>
		<segment3>See, from His head. His hands, His feet. Sorrow and love flow mingled down. Did e'er such love and sorrow meet. Or thorns compose so rich a crown</segment3>
		<segment4>Amazing love, How can it be?. That Thou my God shouldst die for me</segment4>
		<segment5>Guilty, vile and helpless we. Spotless Lamb of God was He. Full atonement can it be?. Hallelujah, Hallelujah</segment5>
		<segment6>Were the whole realm of nature mine. That were a present far too small. Love so amazing, so divine. Demands my soul, my life, my all</segment6>
		<segment7>Amazing love, How can it be?. That Thou my God. The Almighty God. The Son of God shouldst die for me    </segment7>
