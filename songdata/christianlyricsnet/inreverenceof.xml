		<segment1>Loving God how could you take the only thing I felt love from?. Where was your love?. Where was your comfort that I spoke of?. In this world ran by the enemy, which lead me the think you to be the first to damn my lack of faith. and trust left me in a hole of unbelief. Forgive me. She will remain in our hearts forever. On this earth when flesh dies our souls will reunite. She spoke to me of who you are and how your love could never separate us, and how you did things only for good and casted out all that is bad. Forgive me mother for my doubt; my holy father will cast him out. Again! Come back Jesus, cast out Satan, Again! A-men. Thank you for this loss, thank you for your blood, thank you for the 16 years of life with her. and for the everlasting joy I'll have when you come back and save us from this hell. Come back father God of life; enrich us with your wealth.    </segment1>
