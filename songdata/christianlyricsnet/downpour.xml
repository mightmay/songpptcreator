		<segment1>Verse 1: We are dry and thirsty. Lord, we need a saturation. A time of refreshing. Let Your Glory rain down. Let it fill us to running over, running over</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Open up the gates. Flood us with Your rain. Manifest Your Glory Lord. We're thirsty for downpour</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: We can see the rain clouds. As they gather overhead. We're ready to see them break. Send us living water. Let it fill us to running over, running over</segment3>
		<segment4>Vamp: Say Yes (4x). Rain down in this place</segment4>
		<segment5>And fill us to. Running over (6x). (back to chorus)     </segment5>
