		<segment1>I betrayed, You forgave. I ran away, still You stayed. And I lived a lie, You spoke the truth. Now Im undone, with no excuse. I cursed Your name, You called me child. I was to blame, You went to trial. And I lived to take, You died to give me more than I could ever find. And on my own, I made a mess of things</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. But You take it as my offering. You take the best and worst of me. And peace is at Your throne. Where the broken are made whole. And I cant imagine anything. More beautiful or more amazing. When I bring everything. And You take it as my offering</segment2>
		<segment3>Im full of doubt, Youre full of mercy. I come unwound, but You restore me. When Im shaking like a leaf, Youre the comfort that I need. That melts my fears away. And on my own, I made a mess of things</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. And You take it as my offering. My life is made an offering. Im Yours and Yours alone. You take is as my offering. My life is made an offering. Im Yours and Yours alone</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS    </segment5>
