		<segment1>Where is my help, where is my way out, where is my peace, where is my control, what's my meaning, what's my life purpose, where's my peace. Is this all I have?. Born into a world of lies, like being thrown to lions eaten alive. Trying to find some peace in chaos. Trying to regain all which I have lost. Can't you see the emptiness of this world?. Can't you feel the pain which I unfold?. It's here it's all around me like being naked in the cold. Then I was introduced to the greatest truth ever told, Jesus Christ died for our sins. With open arms, he lets us in, paid the price for sin in ourl ives. Truth will set you free.    </segment1>
