		<segment1>At the start. He was there. He was there. In the end. Hell be there. Hell be there. And after all. Our hands have wrought. He forgives</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, the glory of it all. Is He came here. For the rescue of us all. That we may live. For the glory of it all. Oh, the glory of it all</segment2>
		<segment3>All is lost. Find Him there. Find Him there. After night. Dawn is there. Dawn is there. And after all. Falls apart. He repairs. He repairs</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, He is here. With redemption from the fall. That we may live. For the glory of it all. Oh, the glory of it all</segment4>
		<segment5>After night. Comes a light. Dawn is here. Dawn is here. Its a new day, a new day. Oh, everything will change. Things will never be the same. We will never be the same. Oh, everything will change. Things will never be the same. We will never be the same     </segment5>
