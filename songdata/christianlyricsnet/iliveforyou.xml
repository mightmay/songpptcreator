		<segment1>I was lost in darkness. Never knowing where to turn. I thought I had all the answers. But I had so much to learn. Like a child I had gone astray. Trying to make it on my own</segment1>
		<segment2>Like a father You embraced me. And You showed the way back home Now. that I know the truth that you proclaim. I will keep trusting You to fill me. up til only You remain. And I will not rest until my every. word brings glory to Your name. With all that I am, all that I do,</segment2>
		<segment3>I live for You Only You could save me. From the debt I had to pay. So now I want to tell the world. The difference You have made. You have changed the way I live and love. And made my heart brand new. Now that we are joined together. I know I'm nothing without You    </segment3>
