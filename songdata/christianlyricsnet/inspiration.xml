		<segment1>Restless heart. Wait a little while longer. Heaven is holding out for you still. Lay your hand on somebody's shoulder. While you're here show someone you care.. Show them you're there </segment1>
		<segment2>Inspiration is you and i. Changing nations. Changing lives </segment2>
		<segment3>We all feel just a little bit older. As names and faces are passing us by. But there is a reason. Our hearts won't grow colder. There is one thing that won't ever change.. It's always the same </segment3>
		<segment4>Seems we'll never do enough. To tell the world about God's love. But every soul is worth the fight. 'Cause we can change the world. By changing just one life    </segment4>
