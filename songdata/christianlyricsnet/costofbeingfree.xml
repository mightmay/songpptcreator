		<segment1>(Verse 1). Heloo friends. Whatcha think of me now. I've done up and changed. Done a complete turn around. I sold my wheels. For a set of wings. But that's alright. 'Cause I'm through collecting things</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus 1). I wanna fly. I wanna spread my wings. Never wanna come down. In spite of me. I may fall. But it won't be long. 'Til He rescues me. That's the cost of being free. I felt I'd become. So jaded. Forgotten just what I'd done. This big ol' mess that I created. I sold my soul. For a matter of minutes. Now what have I got to show. I'm left empty-handed. If the rain falls down. And covers me. I will not be found. Walking around on these two feet. If I should drown. He'll split the sea. You won't find me. How I long to. Oh I'd love to. How I want to. I just want to fly.     </segment2>
