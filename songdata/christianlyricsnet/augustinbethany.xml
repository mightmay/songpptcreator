		<segment1>With the sounds of the ocean crashing. 7:30 Friday evening. everything comes tumbling down. I choke back each tear that bleeds. Id rather rest forever in your arms. Id rather stay here than go but I know that. I should leave as i sit here helpless</segment1>
		<segment2>Dont go you said you wouldn't. You said you wouldn't. Dont go you said you wouldn't. You said you couldn't</segment2>
		<segment3>I think of our time together is it fading. am I dreaming everything you said lives on. I cherish our memories. I want to kiss your tears away tonight. it's hard to give up the one. You never thought you'd leave</segment3>
		<segment4>Dont go don't go. Your eyes they see through my soul. don't go don't go. You say as I walk out your door</segment4>
		<segment5>With the sounds of the ocean crashing. 7:30 Friday evening. everything comes tumbling down    </segment5>
