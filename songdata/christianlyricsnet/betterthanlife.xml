		<segment1>Better than the riches of this world . Better than the sound of my friends voices . Better than the biggest dreams in my heart . and that's just the start . Better than getting what I say I need . Better than living the life that I wan't to . Better than the love anyone could give  . Your love is  .  . You hold me now in Your arms You never let me go  .  . And You oh Lord made the sunshine . The moonlight and the nightsky . You give me breath and all Your love  . I give my heart to You  . Because I can't stop falling in love with You . I'll never stop falling in love with You      </segment1>
