		<segment1>It doesn't make any sense to me. I was in the park, almost too dark to see. I just couldn't help but stare. Just me and her no one else was there </segment1>
		<segment2>She's my swing set girl. She makes my heart sing. She's my swing set girl. I love to watch her swing </segment2>
		<segment3>I know those kinda girls don't go for guys like me. So I guess I haven't got a lot to lose. But I just can't help wondering. What's she gonna say to me    </segment3>
