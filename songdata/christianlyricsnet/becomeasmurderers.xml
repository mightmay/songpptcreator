		<segment1>Minus blood I'm still not you. Multiplied you are not so noble. Irrational and crippled, too. How the life escapes from your veins </segment1>
		<segment2>We've become as murderers </segment2>
		<segment3>Loss of mind or still too blind?. Sucking your desire to be useful. I cannot pretend or try. Watching as your blood bursts inside </segment3>
		<segment4>We've become as murderers.     </segment4>
