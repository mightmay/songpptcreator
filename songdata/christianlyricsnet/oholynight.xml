		<segment1>O holy night the stars are brightly shining. It is the night of our dear Saviors birth. Long lay the world in sin and error pining. Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth. A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices. For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Fall on your knees. O hear the angel voices. O night divine. O night when Christ was born. O night divine. O night, o night divine</segment2>
		<segment3>Truly He taught us to love one another. His law is love and His gospel is peace. Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother. And in His name all oppression shall cease. Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we. Let all within us praise His holy name</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus Arr.    </segment4>
