		<segment1>i don't know what to do to ease your mind. i don't have the perfect word to make it fine. i'm not so qualified for sympathy. still i am not without love</segment1>
		<segment2>psalm number four falls on your grieving ear. yes, i believe the peace of christ is near. and i am here in his name. you'd do the same, you'd do the same..</segment2>
		<segment3>if you'll let me close. closer than a brother. if you'll let me love you. we'll sit here and cry</segment3>
		<segment4>if you'll let me love (let me love you)</segment4>
		<segment5>never failing, ever hoping. seeking to preserve. it always is giving. often beyond words. and when there's nothing left to say. love has a voice. in sorrow and in heartache. there's a greater joy</segment5>
		<segment6>i don't know what to do to ease your mind. whatever pain you have i'd take as mine. if you'll let me love (let me love you).    </segment6>
