		<segment1>Another question in me. One for the powers that be. It's got me thrown. And so I put on my poker face. And try to figure it out. This undeniable doubt. A common occurance. Feeling so out of place. Guarded and cynical now. Can't help but wondering how. My heart evolved into. A rock beating inside of me. So I reel such a stoic ordeal. Where's that feeling that I don't feel</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain. And like a child he would believe without a reason. Without a trace he disappeared into the void and. I've been searchin' for that missing person</segment2>
		<segment3>Under a lavender moon. So many thoughts consume me. Who dimmed that glowing light. That once burned so bright in me. Is this a radical phase. A problematical age. That keeps me running. From all that I used to be. Is there a way to return. Is there a way to unlearn. That carnal knowledge. That's chipping away at my soul. I've been gone too long. Will I ever find my way home</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>He used to want to try the straight and narrow. He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow. It's been a long time and I haven't seen him lately. But I've been searchin' for that missing person    </segment5>
