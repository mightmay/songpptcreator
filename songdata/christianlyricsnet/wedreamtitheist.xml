		<segment1>This is a black market reformation. Keep your lips closed. And don't you ever give away our underground location. This is a black tie affair. Don't ever close your mouth. and we'll stay here until someone falls in their own snare. I had this planned all along, and I brought you here for this. So tie your mask on and pretend that nothing's wrong </segment1>
		<segment2>And I'll try to stay awake as long as I can. And I'll try to stay here with you </segment2>
		<segment3>This is a black market reformation, how does it feel. to be under the gun. Last ones to laugh pull the trigger here on the run. You can hide the money, I'll mark an X. I am above the law and you're the order, you make. everything make sense </segment3>
		<segment4>And I know Mexico is south of here, beautiful this time of year. So let's jump the border when the coast is clear. Salvation waits at ocean shore, we won't have to lie no more. Don't you worry baby I'll be right here     </segment4>
