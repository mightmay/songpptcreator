		<segment1>I'll fight your war. Promise not to lose. But you give in to circumstance. Not gonna prove to you. Learn of patience worth to you. Many teacher, no student. We go by name, not by rank. Too many gighs incompetent</segment1>
		<segment2>There's no bond between some men. A concept already known. What little time you try to give. A big cheer for you alone. Relax and try. Broke off, broke up and spent. He's choking in left field. Can't tell this place is doomed. Now no place like home. Doomed Now. There's no place like home. I'm gonna prove to you    </segment2>
