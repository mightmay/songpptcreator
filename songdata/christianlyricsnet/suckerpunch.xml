		<segment1>Coke bottle glasses, I'm sitting in the corner with my finger up my nose, And my shoelaces untied again, Another day of school with no friends. A social outcast, Two grades ahead in math, with my highwater pants, Giving meaning to pencil-necked-geek, A dork or so to speak, tongue-in-cheek. </segment1>
		<segment2>They're all sucker-punching me, Get in line for a wedgie. All I want and all I need, Is someone who believes in me. </segment2>
		<segment3>A song sung for underdogs, for all the left out. A flag flying for losers, somewhere in the Heavens. The God of ever-lasting comfort, believed in me, Loved me when I was faithless, he still died for me. </segment3>
		<segment4>Junior High schooler. With pencils in my pockets, and my Trapper Keeper busted, Spilling papers and books on the floor, Not wanting seventh grade anymore. Another class-clown, Acting like a goof to be accepted by my peers, Giving meaning to pencil-necked-geek, a dork or so to speak, tongue in cheek. </segment4>
		<segment5>They're all sucker-punching me, Get in line for a wedgie. All I want and all I need, Is someone who believes in me. </segment5>
		<segment6>A song sung for underdogs, for all the left out. A flag flying for losers, somewhere in the Heavens. The God of ever-lasting comfort, believed in me, Loved me when I was faithless, he still died for-- </segment6>
		<segment7>A song sung for underdogs, for all the left out. A flag flying for losers, somewhere in the Heavens. The God of ever-lasting comfort, believed in me, Loved me when I was faithless, he still died for me.    </segment7>
