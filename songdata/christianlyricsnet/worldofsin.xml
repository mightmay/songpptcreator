		<segment1>Destroy the body in a cruel word, pierce the flesh of the One who saved your soul. In a word utter annihilation, in a breath bring total destruction. We are Christ's body here on the earth, strike only one the whole body feels the pain. We are not separate but together in unity, Christ our uniter, together lets praise His name. PRAISE HIS NAME!. Chorus: World of Sin (3x). The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. Uncontrolled words, poison running running free. Out of our mouth a blessing and a curse. It's shameful pride, this just should not be. With our words we are justified, with a word your soul it will not die. Salvation is attained when you call upon the name, of Jesus Christ, I AM, He's still the same. (Chorus). The tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity. Uncontrolled words, poison running running free. Diversity without unity is anarchy, Love for our neighbor, that's how it ought to be. Chorus: World of Sin, It's just a, World of Sin, Destroy the, World of Sin. (Prov. 18:6-9 21:24, Mark 12:29-31, John 8:58, Exodus 3:13-14, Acts 4:10-12, Romans 10:13, I Cor., 12:12-27, James 3:1-12, Hebrews 13:8)    </segment1>
