		<segment1>I am all alone and I cant be without you. Can you feel the pain thats in my heart. Its been so long since I've had you near me. And it is tearing me apart. I wanna be with you I wanna change my life. I wanna help somebody you know Ive got the time. I know theres pain inside you don't want another girl. You don't like the eart we live on. Then I'll change the world. And its true that I can say I love you. with all thats left inside my soul. You're the only one that makes me laugh instead of cry. You're the only one that makes me whole. I want the world I'll take control. I'll try to make things right I won't turn out the lights. I won't turn my back on you. When things are down I'll turn it all around. Turn a smile from a frown thats what I'm gonna do    </segment1>
