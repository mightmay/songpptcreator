		<segment1>Juliet and Romeo sitting on the patio. Looks like they're under a mistletoe. They think it's true love that they show. What they need to make convey. Is the love of God today. That's what they need to make display. PDA </segment1>
		<segment2>Show your brother. Show your sister. Show your mother. That Jesus really loves her </segment2>
		<segment3>We need some PDA a public display of affection. We need to show some PDA a public display of affection. We need to show some PDA </segment3>
		<segment4>Christ died upon a tree. A spectacle for all to see. For all the world for you and me. Without His love how could we be. His love is not infatuation. No side effects or complications. No lonely times or long vacations. Go with God no hesitations. PDA. A public display of affection </segment4>
		<segment5>We need some PDA a public display of affection. We need to show some PDA a public display of affection. We need to show some PDA </segment5>
		<segment6>It's time to crawl upon the cross. Consider everything but loss. Display your love no matter the cost. Give of yourself to save the lost. Don't get caught in a bad display. Show the love of Christ in a righteous way. You know what He did. So you have to say. PDA </segment6>
		<segment7>We need some PDA a public display of affection. We need to show some PDA a public display of affection. We need to show some PDA    </segment7>
