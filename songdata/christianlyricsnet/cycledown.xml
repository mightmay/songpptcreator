		<segment1>Crashing, covered with debris. Dwelling in my own pity. Cry like I have not. Dig like I had not. I start to claw. Gotta get outta here. I've got to, gotta get out </segment1>
		<segment2>I am, I am, I am on a higher ground. You are, You are my cure from the cycle down (2x) </segment2>
		<segment3>Sinking in a sea of self. Deception never sold so well. Regret like I have not. Pain like I don't want. I start to claw. Gotta get outta here. I've got to, gotta get out </segment3>
		<segment4>I am, I am, I am on a higher ground. You are, You are my cure from the cycle down (2x) </segment4>
		<segment5>Down (3x) </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm so cold and I wonder. How'd I make it this long without You. Pull me out, out from under. On the cycle back to You </segment6>
		<segment7>I am, I am, I am on a higher ground. You are, You are my cure from the cycle down (2x) </segment7>
		<segment8>Down (3x) </segment8>
		<segment9>    </segment9>
