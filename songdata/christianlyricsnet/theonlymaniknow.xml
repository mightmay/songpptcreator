		<segment1>if you run through this world seething i know, i know. i'll see you again. so practice hard and suck it up for the last time. i know you won't laugh so hard when it's your turn to try. cause it's not funny to see her crying </segment1>
		<segment2>i want to believe you. i want to believe in you. i wanted to need you. but what if i never gave that part of myself away </segment2>
		<segment3>another year has past you by but still you're not far, so far. you're not where you should be. you can't afford to listen to your own suggestions. i know you won't laugh so hard when it's your turn to try. cause it's not funny to see her crying </segment3>
		<segment4>when you cry to some else. they say don't be so hard on yourself. take some time to enjoy the good things. but everything in life is either bought or stolen. bought or stolen. bought or stolen. bought or stolen </segment4>
		<segment5>don't say your prayers unless you believe that you will try to red eye to. help make them succeed. just remember that i'm the only friend you've got. i know you wont laugh so hard when it's your turn to try. cause it's not funny to see her cry </segment5>
