		<segment1>- verse 1 -. Im beginning to see how you perceive me, And i am the one who cant finish anything. I guess thats just me. So what can i say?. I always up and leave when i dont want to stay.</segment1>
		<segment2>- chorus -. And i know what you want for me. But you dont see. You dont see what i see, looking through your eyes. And you dont hear what i do in your mind. And you need to realize what i just realizedthat i am doing fine.</segment2>
		<segment3>- verse 2 -. I know what you mean. What you were trying to say. But if its all the same, i dont want to hear it today. I know you mean well. You just want whats best for me. But consider if you will that i might know whats best for me.</segment3>
		<segment4>- chorus -.     </segment4>
