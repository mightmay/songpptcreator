		<segment1>The TV is talking. The telephones ringing. The lights are all on. And the radios screaming. A million distractions are stealing my heart from You. Im tired and empty. This life is relentless. It weakens my knees. And breaks my defenses. Its wearing me down and Im desperate to hear from You</segment1>
		<segment2>Stop the world I wanna get out. I need an escape away from this crowd. Just to hear You speak to me</segment2>
		<segment3>I need to be still before I make a move. I need to be humble with nothing to prove. I need Your Word to show me the truth. And I need time, precious time</segment3>
		<segment4>Stop the world I wanna get out. I need an escape away from this crowd. Just to hear You speak to me. Stop the world Im ready to listen. Show me sign, give me a vision of heaven. I can hold on to. Stop the world I need some time with You</segment4>
		<segment5>Before I can find my voice. I need to hear Your voice. Above all the senseless noise    </segment5>
