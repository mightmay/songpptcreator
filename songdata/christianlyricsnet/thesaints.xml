		<segment1>To those whose steps aren't steady. To those whose hearts are heavy. To those whose faith is all but gone. To those that struggle on, struggle on</segment1>
		<segment2>Come and lay your burdens down. Come lift your empty hands. You are not alone, we are not alone. So, hold on</segment2>
		<segment3>To all the saints that keep on praying. And all the children that keep on waiting. And all those that sing the Savior's song. Lift your heads up and keep on living. Hold tight to the hope we are given. For we know that we won't be waiting long</segment3>
		<segment4>Can you hear the music playing. Can you feel the dream is waking. We are running towards redemption. We are never standing still</segment4>
		<segment5>Through the problems and the pain. Through the striving and the strain. You are not alone, we are not alone. So hold on</segment5>
		<segment6>He is coming soon, He is coming soon. He will take His bride, He will make her new. He is coming soon, He is coming soon to carry us home    </segment6>
