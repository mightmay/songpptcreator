		<segment1>In returning to the scene of a fatal accident. The glass on the ground holds evidence. Of all that went wrong, of all that was missed. So sorry I missed. Can you hear me, the voice inside your ear. Can you feel me, the wind that chills your tears. And all of this times we wasted was lost inside of this. Can you hear me, the noise that brought you here. I remember all the times I was blind behind the wheel. The sharp screaming sound, the pain I would feel. From all I had lost, from all I had killed. So sorry I killed. The blood will dry on the pavement. All of my wounds will heal. The wreckage will fall to the wasteland. All will be quiet and still    </segment1>
