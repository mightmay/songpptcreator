		<segment1>The fog has finally cleared to see, The beautiful life youve given me. To feel the breeze of my newborns gentle breath. With one to walk hand in hand, To share this life that you have planned. Its like a storybook with dreams. That are meant to see every next step is an extraordinary scene</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. I know that Ive been, Given more than beyond measure, I come alive when, I see beyond my fears. I know that Ive been given more than earthly treasure, I come alive when. Ive broken down and given you control</segment2>
		<segment3>Ive faced a great tragedy, But have seen the works of what you bring. A display of faith that you give, I dont know if I will ever understand. The depth of what it is youve done inside, But I know that I will wont find any worth apart from you </segment3>
		<segment4>Everything that I have. Has been given so unselfishly. And shown that even when I dont deserve. You always show the fullness of your love </segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
