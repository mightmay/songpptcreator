		<segment1>Sometimes it's sink or swim. And I've been treading water. I should have expected the flood. But floating never has been easy for me. You caught me carefree. And You called me like You saw me: a sinner</segment1>
		<segment2>And I said five wits, looks, and strength. I don't think are much in the way of companions. And good deeds couldn't pay my account. Not kinsmen nor knowledge stand. The trial of every man. Don't call me every man</segment2>
		<segment3>Call me Christian. (I am in You, You are in me, I am in You). Call me Christian. (I am in You, You are in me, I am in You). Call me Christian</segment3>
		<segment4>I've looked on the evergreen. And I've seen it constantly grow and show us life. And I want to live eternally. I want to be an imitation of Christ. I want to be a little Christ</segment4>
		<segment5>As a boy I'd put my steps. In my brother's bigger tracks. To match his stride. And just like that I follow Jesus. Jesus is my guide.    </segment5>
