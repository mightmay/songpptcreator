		<segment1>Tell me of your perfect world, that you fight so hard for. Show me your priorities, what you live your life for. We're not against your beliefs. We just know there is little time. There are more important things. It's time to choose your side. This is the time to fight for souls. Winning the lost, it is our goal. It will soon be too late. Much more important than what's on my plate. My diet, your priority. That's not the way it should be. More important, the things that I wear, than where I'll spend eternity. But what about my soul, it might be too late. But at least I did not kill for all the things that I ate. This it the time to fight for souls. Winning the lost, it is our goal. It will soon be too late. Much more important that what's on my plate. And I've thought about this, and I've prayed about this, it just seems foolish to me. I'd rather be with friends for eternity.    </segment1>
