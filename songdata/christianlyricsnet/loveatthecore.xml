		<segment1>We want love, love at the core. The cold of the flesh always seems to creep inside of my chest. And I need the pulse of you God. To fill these veins and touch my heart so I can start. Living again. We've seen the dark of the night. Sun won't you come shine some light on our lives</segment1>
		<segment2>We want love, love at the core. So much more than what we're living for. We want love, we want love. Love at the core</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm numb to cries of this world. As I lie holding on. On you all of my my everything. I need you breathe into me. Sun won't you come shine</segment3>
		<segment4>Love, love at the core. So much more than what we're living for. We want love, want love. Love at the core. So much more of this life. That we're reaching for. We want love</segment4>
		<segment5>Sweeter than wine you are. You are. We've seen the dark of the night. Sun won't you come shine some light on our lives</segment5>
		<segment6>We want love, love at the core. So much more than we're living for. We want love, we want love. Love at the core. So much more than this. Like that we're reaching for. We want love to bind us tonight. Leave behind your own disguise. So love can find you and I     </segment6>
