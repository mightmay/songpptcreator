		<segment1>We have all heard what we wanted to hear. &quot;Truth&quot; that sounds right to our ears</segment1>
		<segment2>But what wisdom is there within us. To live based on the feeling of our hearts. How many times has instinct let us down. Never to be thought through. Never to be questioned. Say what you really mean. When your ambition calls you. For what use is there in praying. If you will only hear what you want to hear?</segment2>
		<segment3>We speak of fighting to resist this world. But what about the battle within us?. If we have chosen to live against the grain. Then why are we all facing the same way?. There is no difference between us and them. If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments.     </segment3>
