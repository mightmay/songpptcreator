		<segment1>It's been a long time coming. Since I saw your face. Since we held it down. Since we were in the chase. It was the road less traveled. The path less formed. A skinny trail. It was barely worn. But we kept on walkin' and slippin' and talkin' and runnin' and fallin' and cryin' and crawlin'. We were in the trenches. On top of the world. Young refugees but we were momma's pearls. Where you been dog? Where you been?</segment1>
		<segment2>I thought you fell off the face of the earth ..</segment2>
		<segment3>It's been way too long and we've come to far. For you drop out my life like a falling star. Right off my radar. Not a sign or a trace. You know I had love for you that's bigger than mistakes. Now Hope road is calling. Let's pack you up and move. 'Cause real friends are willing to intrude. So I'm gonna push in cause I wanna love you well. Let the ghosts of your past rest</segment3>
		<segment4>Open up the door. This is the first day of the rest of your life. What are you waiting for?. This is the first day of the rest of your life</segment4>
		<segment5>Open up the door. To life ..</segment5>
		<segment6>Behold I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door. I will come in ..     </segment6>
