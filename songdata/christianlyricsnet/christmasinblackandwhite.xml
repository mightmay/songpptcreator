		<segment1>A teenage girl, a Nazarite. Who loves Yahweh and does what's right. Is visited by an angel</segment1>
		<segment2>She's terrified, mystified. Till he clarifies that he's here to prophesize. And says, &quot;Fear not. You who are highly favorite of God. The Lord is with you&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>Still Mary was greatly troubled by his words. (Christmas in black and white). And wondered what kind of greeting this might be. And he said, &quot;Do not be afraid, Mary. For you have found favor with God'&amp;#128;</segment3>
		<segment4>'&amp;#128;&amp;#156;You will be with child, and will give birth to a son. And you are to call His name Jesus. (Christmas in black and white). He will be great, He will be called the Son of the Most High. Mary replied, &quot;How can these things be. Since I have not yet been with a man?&quot;</segment4>
		<segment5>The angel answered and said. &quot;The Holy Spirit shall come upon you. And the power of the Most High shall shower you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God'&amp;#128;. (Christmas in black and white)</segment5>
		<segment6>'&amp;#128;&amp;#156;Even Elizabeth, your relative. Is going to have a child in her old age. And she who is said to be barren is in her sixth month. For nothing is impossible with God&quot;</segment6>
		<segment7>&quot;I am the Lord's servant&quot;, Mary answered. &quot;May it be to me as you have said&quot;. Then the angel was gone    </segment7>
