		<segment1>Angels we have heard on high. sweetly singing o'er the plains. and the mountains in reply. echoing their joyous strains. Gloria In Excelsius Deo</segment1>
		<segment2>Shepherds why this jubilee, Why your joyous strains prolong?. What the gladsome tidings be, Which inspire your heavenly song?. Come to Bethlehem and see, Christ whose birth the angels sing!. Come adore on bended knee, Christ our Lord, the new born king!. Gloria In Excelsius Deo     </segment2>
