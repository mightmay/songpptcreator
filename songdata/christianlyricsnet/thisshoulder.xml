		<segment1>Come with me, ride upon my shoulder why don't you. Don't you see, you can't fall down when you're. On my shoulder. You wonder if you must climb. To get away from the slime. Seeking it's way in to your heart. But I know. Yes I know</segment1>
		<segment2>You'll see this through. Come ride upon my shoulders I'll carry you. Why is it that you must fight alone?. I've known you before you did. So don't you play no charade</segment2>
		<segment3>Breathe my air, come ride upon my shoulders. Don't feel scared, I won't break when you're on. My shoulder. You wonder if you must climb. To get away from the slime. But I alone will lift you up. Because I know. Yes I know</segment3>
		<segment4>It is time. To leave yourself behind. I can take every drop of your spit. But it's when you do you see you don't fit. It is time    </segment4>
