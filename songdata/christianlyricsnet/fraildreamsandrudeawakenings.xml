		<segment1>We fight these fools, and it's so true. That kindness kills. More than a fist could ever do. And I'd be scared of Love I never wanted. You'd be surprised at what really stirs my heart. Passion fuels who we are. This is why we're here every night. Critical minded from a place so full of shame.</segment1>
		<segment2>We sleep tonight so sound. And empty promise of a dream. Among the streets of this dead town, I'm waking up.</segment2>
		<segment3>Over burdened, shoved aside. Remember peace in all this mess. This dead town.</segment3>
		<segment4>We sleep tonight so sound. And empty promise of a dream. Among the streets of this dead town, I'm waking up    </segment4>
