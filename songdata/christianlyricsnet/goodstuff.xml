		<segment1>if i tell you something you need to know. i gotta back it up. i gotta let it show. we can be so loud. we can write a song that makes us all proud. but without love. it's just a sound </segment1>
		<segment2>everybody show what we know. and let that good stuff flow. everybody show what we know. and let that good stuff flow </segment2>
		<segment3>i could speak with tongues of Angels. apologetics in a slick rhetoric. either way without love my words are dead. we have love. we have forgiveness. we have grace without a limit. so if it has been revealed to us. should it not then be contagious? </segment3>
		<segment4>we got the rhythm. we got the rhyme. print up a t-shirt. throw them a line </segment4>
		<segment5>but without love we are nothing    </segment5>
