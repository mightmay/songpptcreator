		<segment1>I used to think that I was never good enough to cut it. I bought the lines that were selling time after time. But when You opened up my mind and I refused to shut it. You brought me to a place where I could leave it all behind</segment1>
		<segment2>Good-bye to my old life. I don't listen to those lies anymore. You've given me new life. Loving you is what I was made for</segment2>
		<segment3>It took a while for me to see but when I finally saw it. I knew I had to leave my sordid past in the past. I couldn't get there on my own it was Your grace that taught it. My sin is covered by Your blood and I'm not looking back</segment3>
		<segment4>You saw right through me. Your kindness drew me. Your mercy knew me. Your love came to me    </segment4>
