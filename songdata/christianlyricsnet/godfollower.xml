		<segment1>My heart is restless as I wander through this jungle. The trees above refuse to let the sunlight through. And somewhere deep inside I hear the whispered longings. That tell me I was made for more than this</segment1>
		<segment2>A blinding flash of light falls down into the darkness. Slowly I notice strange new markings on the trail. The crimson drops are calling out to me come and follow. I am the God who made you, let Me show you how to live. And I cry</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to be a God follower. I want to go wherever He leads. I want to be a God follower. I want to walk the trail Hes marked for me. And be a God follower. (More than anything)</segment3>
		<segment4>And now I journey on with purpose and with passion. Just like a dead man whos been given breath again. And though this path can still grow dark with tears and sorrow. I know He will never leave me. So with everything I am I will say</segment4>
		<segment5>And when I reach Gods place. I will look into His face. And then Ill look for you. Will I find you there?. Can you say with me. I want to be a God follower. I want to be a God follower. I want to be a God follower. I want to be a God follower </segment5>
