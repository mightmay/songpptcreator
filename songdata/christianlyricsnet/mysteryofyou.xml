		<segment1>I remember my younger days fondly. So much was beyond me. So much yet unknown. Like a child I created my places. And filled up my pages. With poems and prose</segment1>
		<segment2>Life untasted lay stretched out before me. A child in awe of Your glory</segment2>
		<segment3>You are the Great Mystery. Calling me endlessly deeper to love You. And I will answer with reckless abandoning. Everything keeping me from You. I could never unravel the mystery of You</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I'm older and sharing my world. With a beautiful girl. Who's the love of my life. More and more I pack life into boxes. And wonder who watches. The poems I write</segment4>
		<segment5>But You're still the question my heart longs to answer. A debtor in search of the Master</segment5>
		<segment6>More than I know. Or I could imagine, You are    </segment6>
