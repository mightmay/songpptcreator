		<segment1>I have found exceeding joy. Jesus answered when I called. This Name that has saved me. Pure love that embraced me</segment1>
		<segment2>Mercy, grace, eternal life. Bought from darkness to His light</segment2>
		<segment3>While lost in my sin, He. Raised me and made me live</segment3>
		<segment4>My soul magnifies the Lord. My heart joys in God my Saviour. For He lifts the lowly. He's done great things for me. I will sing, praising evermore. He is mighty and Holy is His Name.</segment4>
		<segment5>I will lift my head up high. Praising Jesus through each trial. Though I have not seen Him. I love Him completely     </segment5>
