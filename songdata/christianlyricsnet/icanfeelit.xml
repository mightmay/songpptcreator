		<segment1>I seek the silence through the chaos and the noise. That's when I'm listening, I want to hear Your voice. Sometimes, it softly speaks, a whisper on the wind. Sometimes, it's louder when Your Spirit rushes in</segment1>
		<segment2>I can feel it all around me, I can feel it all around me</segment2>
		<segment3>I keep on searching for Your presence in this place. I see Your hand at work, I feel Your touch of grace. Sometimes, it falls like rain upon this thirsty land. Sometimes, You gently stir the heart of every man</segment3>
		<segment4>I can feel it, I can feel it. I can feel Your heartbeat</segment4>
		<segment5>I pray You'd send Your presence down, send it down. Fill us with Your Spirit now.     </segment5>
