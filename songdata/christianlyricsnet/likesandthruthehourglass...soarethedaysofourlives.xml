So are the days of our lives&quot; . It seems like every time I get something going . It falls apart right in my hands . It seems like every time I get it figured out and . I have no doubt, that's when I'm farthest from the truth . My world is breaking down around me . I see my destroyed world in front of me . Any and every thing I trusted . I weep for my world disgusted . I always learn the hard way, there ain't an easy way to learn . That's what I've learned . Was I tought the right things tought the right? . I don't know and that is all I know.
