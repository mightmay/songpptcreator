		<segment1>Want some gypsies in your wallet? Sugar, can't you see?. What's on this T.V. station is blasphemy. I think the craziest part is that celebrity. Don't turn on the psychics -- I don't wanna see. God has told me what's to come. God has told me what's to come. That ain't the way that it's done  no, uh uh. You're phonin' up the weirdos -- get some prayer into this room. Their crystal ball is broken -- but there's still a spell on you. And that psychic friend you spoke with -- has sales he has to get. Open up your wallet, sucker -- credit, cash or check?!!. God has told me what's to come. God has told me what's to come. That ain't the way that it's done, son. I've read the Revelation  oh yeah!. They don't know what's happ'nin' -- someone's knockin' at the door. You're lookin' for a real friend -- He's passed this way before. They've seen so many things -- but they ain't never seen the Lord. And if you don't repent -- you ain't gonna see Him no more. God has told me what's to come. God has told me what's to come. He said, that aint the way that its done, son. Dont mess with divination. God has told me lots of phonies gonna come who wanna snow me. With divination -- whoa yeah yeah. God has told me not to talk with a diviner. God has told me .. the truth.
