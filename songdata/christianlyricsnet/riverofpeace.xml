		<segment1>Verse 1: She was a gorgeous little girl, Only ten years old. With her mother's smile. And her father's eyes. And she was taken way too soon, A life so full of promise, Full of hope, But never realized </segment1>
		<segment2>And I raise my fist in anger. And wonder why you take. The tender hearts and. Leave the rest of us behind. </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Ours is not to question why, Ours is just to live and try, To settle for the answer. Whatever it might be. Until we see you face to face. In another time and place. Where the river of your peace. Runs free. </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: Now thirty years have come. And gone. Since his country shipped him home. With a silver star and. A broken heart. More than his innocence was lost. To a complicated war. His baby brother didn't make it. Back at all. </segment4>
		<segment5>And each nicht in silent anger, He tries to understand the sacrifice. And each night he falls apart. </segment5>
		<segment6>You said we're all your precious children, But I must admit, Sometimes we feel so small. We wonder if you're there, Or if you really care at all. </segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus:.. </segment7>
		<segment8>Until we see you face to face. In another time and place. Where the river of your peace runs free, Where the river of your peace runs free, Where the river of your peace runs free.    </segment8>
