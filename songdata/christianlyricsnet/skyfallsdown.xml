		<segment1>People talkin' like it's the end of time. I look up to the heavens for a sign. Everybody's lookin' at me. But I won't be deceived or afraid. 'Cause I know that the sun is on the way. Sky falls down. It crumbles into the sea. The sun goes out. He's coming back for me. I'll be found at the place. Where the gravity leaves the ground. I won't be comin' down</segment1>
		<segment2>I've heard rumors that war's not far away. If they take me I know just what to say. Everybody's up in arms. But I won't be alarmed or afraid. 'Cause I know that the sun is on the way.     </segment2>
