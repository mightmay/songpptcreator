		<segment1>I'm sure if you wanted to stop love, You could just untie your end and let it go. But, my God, you don't. Yeah, I think I love you for it. </segment1>
		<segment2>You're still sending cells to their rightful places, When forming more likely to escape. Such a narrow way of life. What's it look like from your side?. From here I can't see why it's worth. One more coming out cursed? </segment2>
		<segment3>Say it, say it!. Say what this is all for!. Say it's redemption. </segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause our world is grey, world is grey. We're just swaying from side to side. Our world is grey, world is grey. We are thieves and saints alike. But you don't let go, don't let go. We keep swaying and swaying. And you don't let go, don't. Yeah, I think I love you for it. </segment4>
		<segment5>He's shooting god up in his arm through a needle. And she's putting cuts on her legs to bleed out the devil. &quot;Surely you will not die, eat and be like God.&quot;. What have we done? </segment5>
		<segment6>Say it, say it!. Say that this is all for redemption. </segment6>
		<segment7>'Cause our world is grey, world is grey. We're just swaying from side to side. Our world is grey, world is grey. We are thieves and saints alike. But you don't let go, don't let go. We keep swaying from side to side. We all just sway, we all just sway. But you don't let go, you don't. You don't.     </segment7>
