		<segment1>Salvation (Psalm 71). Shawn McDonald</segment1>
		<segment2>I run for dear life to You My God. I'll never live to regret it. Do what You do so well. And Get me out of this mess and up on my feet</segment2>
		<segment3>You are my Salvation. You are my Fortress. You are my Salvation. In whom I trust</segment3>
		<segment4>Put Your ear to the ground and listen. Give me space for salvation. Be a guest room where I can retreat. You said Your door is always open</segment4>
		<segment5>My God, free me from the grip of the wicked. From the clutch of the bad and the bully</segment5>
		<segment6>You are my Salvation. You are my Fortress. You are my Salvation. In whom I trust    </segment6>
