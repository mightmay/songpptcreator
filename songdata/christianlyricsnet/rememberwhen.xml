		<segment1>Silent screams echo through your life. Can anyone hear of what has just become. All alone. No time for a change. No sight for an end. You toss and turn with no one around. Think of the days when life was so simple yet so very complex. Re-capture those days from the first time. The first time. It's all gone. Innocence of your youth when you once had a mind with a clear conscience. No name past. Erase all the hurt, yet it never leaves. Plagued with fear. Choices from the past creeping around. It brings sound after sound. Decisions gone bad. Re-capture those days from the first time. Try and bring back your past. It's too late.     </segment1>
