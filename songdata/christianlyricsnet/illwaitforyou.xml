		<segment1>Morning Mr. Repo Man. Give me one more week and. Ill be gone</segment1>
		<segment2>Its been a long hard month of Sundays. And still no rain. Nothin left around here but the dust and shame. I know you know. I know you know</segment2>
		<segment3>And Im tryin to find a way. To hold on to my faith</segment3>
		<segment4>While I wait for you. I wait for you </segment4>
		<segment5>Now I lie awake at night. Tryin not to think. But these are the hardest times Ive ever seen. Im still holdin on</segment5>
		<segment6>I know you never said itd be easy. All thick and no thin. But the man who waits. Is the man who wins. Holdin on. Oh yeah, Im holdin on </segment6>
		<segment7>Gonna hide myself away. Hide myself away</segment7>
		<segment8>And Ill wait for you. Ill wait for you. Ill wait for you. Ill wait for you</segment8>
		<segment9>I need you now. I need you now. I need you now. You know I need you now</segment9>
		<segment10>And Ill wait for you. Ill wait for you. Im gonna wait for you. Ill wait for you</segment10>
		<segment11>Im gonna walk on. And not get weary now. Im gonna run. And not fall down. I know that someday. Ill get my wings somehow. And you will carry me. You will carry me</segment11>
		<segment12>Im gonna rise up. Like an eagle now. Gonna ride that big blue sky. And should I someday. Fall back down again. You will carry me. You will carry me even now. Carry me even now. Youre gonna carry me. You will carry. You will carry me even now. Oh, carry me, oh yeah    </segment12>
