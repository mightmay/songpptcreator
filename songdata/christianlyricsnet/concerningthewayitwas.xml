		<segment1>The shadow cast upon me. Eyes sewn shut with the wires. Lies bound by the lies that pierce my skin. Heart as cold as winter. Although there is no season. In this place of loneliness </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm drowning. Every day the same. Locked at the ankles plotting my escape. I've tried so hard to remind myself. Life's only what I see. I thought I lost the meaning but I was only finding you </segment2>
		<segment3>The years without the freedom. Tortured by words of reason. Convincing those around me. That life consists of nothing. And dead the end of all things. You've broken through the darkness. The shadow gone forever </segment3>
		<segment4>And now I live. And now there's hope. [X4].     </segment4>
