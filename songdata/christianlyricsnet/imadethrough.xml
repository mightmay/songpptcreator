		<segment1>I thought that i would not survive. I came this close to losing my mind. Sometimes you go through things in life. That makes you say 'Lord, why me this time?</segment1>
		<segment2>But he's so faithful. He keeps making ways out of no way. Just when i thought that i couldn't take no more. I MADE IT THROUGH</segment2>
		<segment3>So many nights i had to cry. So many storm clouds, i lost sight. I felt like giving up the fight. Never thought i would see daylight</segment3>
		<segment4>But he's so faithful. He keeps making ways out of no way. Just when i thought that i couldn't take no more. I MADE IT. I MADE IT THROUGH. I MADE IT, MADE IT. MADE IT THROUGH. MADE IT. OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH</segment4>
		<segment5>I MADE IT, MADE IT. MADE IT THROUGH. OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH</segment5>
		<segment6>STILL STANDING, I MADE IT. STILL STANDING, I MADE IT. STILL PRAISING, I MADE IT. STILL DANCING, I MADE IT. OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH</segment6>
		<segment7>STILL STANDING, I MADE IT. STILL CLAPPING, I MADE IT. STILL DANCING, I MADE IT. STILL DANCING, I MADE IT. OH, OH, OH, OH, OH, OH</segment7>
