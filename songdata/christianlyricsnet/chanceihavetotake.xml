		<segment1>Down inside this heart of mine. There is a door locked by design. Hinges of rust from all the tears. Keep it shut from all my fears. You ask me to let down the wall. With no defense to catch my fall. Its too late to play it safe. Its the chance I have to take. . CHORUS: So I choose love, a love that can take. A heart so cold and teach it to break. Tears may fall along the way. Thats the chance I have to take. . Ive seen a mockery made of love. Everyone talks but no one does. So I hid my heart upon a shelf. To never give to anyone else. . I fall apart when I hear Your words. Healing will come to those who hurt. Change never comes to . Those who wait. Its the chance I have to take. . Chorus. . True joy in living is found only. In forgiving. The ones whove scarred you so. Let them go  let them go. . Now You are asking for my trust. Thats been abused so very much. But Ill give to You the me. That breaks. Its the chance I have to take    </segment1>
