		<segment1>Tin man is what I'm called. Or puritan?. From the confederacy of my system. Defined relevance, from the immaculately attired</segment1>
		<segment2>I am made from the wires, of my synthesizer. Made from the wires, made from the wires</segment2>
		<segment3>Ideals from the pondering looks of eels. Written prescriptions by the ones who need them. My own feelings, shunned by group desires     </segment3>
