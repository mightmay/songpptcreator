		<segment1>Verse 1. I woke up in darkness. sounded by silence. oh where, where have I gone?</segment1>
		<segment2>I woke to reality. losing its grip on me. oh where, where have I gone?</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause I can see the light. before I see the sunrise</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. You called and you shouted. broke through my deafness. now Im breathing in. and breathing out. Im alive again!</segment4>
		<segment5>You shattered my darkness. washed away my blindness. now Im breathing in. and breathing out. Im alive again!</segment5>
		<segment6>Verse 2. They never loved you. you waited for me, I searched for you&amp;#133;. what took me so long?</segment6>
		<segment7>I was looking outside. as a love would ever want to hide. Im finding I was wrong</segment7>
		<segment8>Cause I can feel the wind. before it hits my skin</segment8>
		<segment9>Bridge. Cause I want you!. Yes, I want you, I need you. And Ill do what ever I have to. Just to get through. cause I love you. Yeah, I love you!    </segment9>
