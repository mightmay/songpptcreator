		<segment1>Ive got scars, that you're not seeing, I've got so many wounds, they're still healing, I've got a heart it's having trouble beating, I'm losing the feeling, been broken so long. Ive got eyes, their blood shot from crying, I've got thoughts caught between the truth and lying, Ive got emotions, built up and locked away, pulling me in every direction, trying to escape. Through all of my storms, through every fire, I know you're the reason, that I'm still alive. Standing in the sun, I feel like my life has just begun, walking through the rain, there's just no other way that I could have changed. well it's easy to walk, when the ground isn't shaking, it's easy to laugh when my heart isn't breaking, it's easy to see when I look through your eyes, that I've been believing so many lies. I wanna find a place I can go, where I can be free to let my heart show, I wanna be a person who dares to love without condition, to love without fear. Standing in the sun, I feel like my life has just begun, walking through the rain, there's just no other way that I could have changed, because you, make me feel so alive, all this time it was you, you were saving my life. Over and over, I keep going back in my mind to the moment, I realized that all this time I was trying to run away, your love was chasing me, chasing me yeah, whoa!    </segment1>
