		<segment1>Outside.. They hear a different song then inside. What's in your heart?. You'll find.. They are just waiting for you this time, To watch you fall.</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. If you're drawing lines you can get off our side. We wanna be wrong if what you say is right. Down on you, down on you, they'll never stop. And how can you, now can you use what you've got?</segment2>
		<segment3>Our fire, burning inside of you and they've tried. to put you out. You'll find the simply maybe that you might die. Not on your own.</segment3>
		<segment4>But they will tell you you're wrong</segment4>
		<segment5>If you're drawing lines you can get off our side. We wanna be wrong if what you say is right. Down on you, down on you, they'll never stop. And how can you, now can you use what you've got?</segment5>
		<segment6>Your blankets of word, it's still making us cold. We've tasted, life wasted and it's getting old. You'll never make it, at least we tried. And if we make it, at least you tried. We've tried. We've tried. We've tried. We've tried</segment6>
		<segment7>They can't stop us. This is who are. You can not stop us. This is who we are.</segment7>
		<segment8>If you're drawing lines you can get off our side. We wanna be wrong if what you say is right. Down on you, down on you, they'll never stop. And how can you, now can you use what you have got?    </segment8>
