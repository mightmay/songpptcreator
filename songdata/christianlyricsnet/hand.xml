		<segment1>I'm here waiting for something new to break my heart. So callous laden, I can't feel a thing at all. Will You catch my fall? </segment1>
		<segment2>From lost and not found, to run and not hide. My hand inside.. (Your hand) </segment2>
		<segment3>Fear is keeping time with the beating of my heart. Doin' way too much thinkin'. And it's tearing me apart. But I, I feel You reach for me </segment3>
		<segment4>From lost and not found, to run and not hide. My hand inside.. (Your hand). Losing my grip falling so far. My hand inside Your hand </segment4>
		<segment5>I hear Your voice and follow. So hard to believe, and still I go     </segment5>
