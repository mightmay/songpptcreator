		<segment1>Head over here and take me. Head over heels and aching. When I told you I was yours, I was yours</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). In this life you're the one place I call home. In this life you're the feeling I belong. In this life you're the flower and the thorn. You're everything that's fair in love and war</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm coming down like a gun shot. In all these battles that I've fought. You're the mark I'm aiming for. I was yours</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Head over heels. Head over heels</segment5>
		<segment6>In this life I'm stubborn to the core. In this life I've been burning after more. We both know what these open arms are for. You're everything that's fair</segment6>
		<segment7>In this life you're my only one. In this life you're my only one. In this life you're my only one. In this life you're my only one</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus)    </segment8>
