		<segment1>Am I your enemy. If I speak truth? (Galatians 4:16). And the whispers in my ear. I sing from roofs (Matthew 10:26-28). No, Im your enemy. if I dont say enough. Oh that you could see. This truth is love</segment1>
		<segment2>I will fail you in love. We will all fail in love. But that doesnt mean that Im your enemy. Comfort doesnt equal love. Sugar water isnt love. But the Truth will come and set us free (John 8:32, 36)</segment2>
		<segment3>Would you tell me if you knew that I was dying?. Some sort of parasite that got into my brain. Would I tell you that I thought that you were lying?. Ignoring evidence, ignoring all the pain</segment3>
		<segment4>Theres too much sugar. Too much water. Too much sugar. Too much water</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus, set our hearts on fire. And let it burn our flesh down to the ground. Jesus, set our hearts on fire. And burn our flesh to the ground</segment5>
		<segment6>Am I your enemy?. Am I your enemy?. Im not your enemy?. Im not the enemy!     </segment6>
