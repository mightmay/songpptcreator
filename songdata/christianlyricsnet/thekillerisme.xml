		<segment1>When you speak you might as well be spitting in my face, I wish you weren't so beautiful. Your eyes never cease to follow me. But I'm desperate and it's definite that I'll give into the power of my weaknesses. It's so obvious. This could be a gun pointed at me. Should I move or should I take this when these angels leave. Please don't tell me that you love me. Cause I know it won't be real. I wish I wasn't there. You're coming in between the flowers and the grave. You're coming in between him and me. But my arms are tired; you know there's only one escape, girl. It's not you. All these soldiers with their whips, &quot;Oh my God I'm giving them the cue!&quot;. You can bet that I'll throw it all away for her tonight. I'm oh so human and I am losing every second of this fight. Oh I almost forgot that I'm sorry and I take back every word I said!. You never learn. You seem to notice all these broken pieces.     </segment1>
