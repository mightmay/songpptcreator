		<segment1>Take me past the outer courts. Into the Holy place. Past the brazen altar. Lord I want to see Your face. Pass me by the crowds of people. The priests who sing Your praise. I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness. And it's only found one place</segment1>
		<segment2>Take me in to the Holy of Holies. Take me in by the blood of the Lamb. Take me in to the Holy of Holies. Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am. Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I am     </segment2>
