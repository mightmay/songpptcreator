		<segment1>A summer drive away from dying: a broken heart nothing to lose. I know it hurts so bad just trying to please the ones you hate to love. And I wrote this note about someone I used to know. so I'd remember how life can be so short when your left alone to wonder. how it is someone opens and shuts the door. </segment1>
		<segment2>I know your cold but come home. It's a shame how short we all have come. </segment2>
		<segment3>You set your mind on cruise control; knuckles grip the wheel in fear to let it go. Love is empty,love is cruel,love it blindly breaks the rules. How could you have been a fool?. It's something all of us go through. You choke back tears and swallow lies but those wiper blades won't fix you eyes, count on having clouded vision for at least a little while. </segment3>
		<segment4>And I know you're cold but come home: it's a shame how short we all have come. And I know you're cold but come home. </segment4>
		<segment5>Please don't face the headlights of the oncoming cars along. We wont forget the past. We wont forget the past. (And I know you're cold). Say all the answers and I will let you go. I wont look back. and I wont look back. Say all the answers. and I will let you go. I will let you go. I will let you go </segment5>
		<segment6>Say all the answers and I will let you go. I won't look back. I won't look back. [x3] </segment6>
		<segment7>Please don't face the headlights of the oncoming cars along. and I will let you go.    </segment7>
