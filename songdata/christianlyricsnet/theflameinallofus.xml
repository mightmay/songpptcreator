		<segment1>This world has taken me by storm, It makes me feel like running, This place is making me transform, Until I feel like nothing</segment1>
		<segment2>It's the strength in you who believe, ..that surrounds everything, The way you look out for me, the way you burn..</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. It's the flame, in all of us, the same, That makes us feel this. Flame, in all of us, the same, that makes us feel it</segment3>
		<segment4>We are the youth of yesterday, We've brought you pain and sorrow, That's what they say, but they paved the way, We are the new tomorrow</segment4>
		<segment5>It's the strength in you who believe, ..that surrounds everything, The way you look out for me, the way you burn..</segment5>
		<segment6>It's the flame, in all of us, the same, That makes us feel this. Flame, in all of us, the same, that makes us. It's the flame, in all of us, the same, That makes us feel this. Flame, in all of us, the same, that makes us feel it</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge. It's the flame in all of us that makes, The change in all of us, that takes, The blame in all of us,(yeah), And still keeps it alive (X2)    </segment7>
