		<segment1>I guess there's only one place to go from here. I think the options are clear anyway. I'm sure you're tired of waiting for me. To figure out where you fit in. I guess I'm afraid of what we could be. Cause I don't want to sell you short of your dreams. I'm sorry for making you wait for me. Cause I don't want to hold you down. But I don't want to set you free. I don't want to make you run from me</segment1>
		<segment2>I guess it's hard to believe that I. Could make myself give up. [ Find more Lyrics on http://mp3lyrics.org/Fo8 ]. After all this time you and me. Trying hard to make sense of our differences. Pretending we both had everything. I guess I believed in our fantasy. You only loved the one you wanted me to be. I'm sorry for breaking your faith in me. I don't want to hold you down</segment2>
		<segment3>But what if you're more than I could please. Could you accept apologies?. I don't want to squander all your time. I don't want to mislead you. I think we both knew that it was done. Sorry I had to be the one. Sometimes I wish it were the other way around</segment3>
		<segment4>I wish you weren't supposed to be set free    </segment4>
