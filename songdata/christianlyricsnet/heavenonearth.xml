		<segment1>Rags to riches, so they say. She got her break and she found her way. I admit this may sound strange. This girl is dancing a different way</segment1>
		<segment2>If they only knew how You've mended. My broken wings, now I'm flying</segment2>
		<segment3>Your love is Heaven on Earth. I'll shout it out to all of the world. There's no doubt my greatest dream has come true. Just to be loved by You</segment3>
		<segment4>Whom You set free is free indeed. I've got the strength of my God in me. Well, You restored my dignity. Oh, completely, You love me</segment4>
		<segment5>If they only knew how You've mended. My broken wings, now I'm flying</segment5>
		<segment6>Your love is Heaven on Earth. I'll shout it out to all of the world. There's no doubt my greatest dream has come true. Just to be loved by You</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm in Heaven, Heaven on earth. Promise to promise, this must be Heaven on earth. Glory to Glory, this must be Heaven. Heaven on Earth</segment7>
		<segment8>Well, if they only knew how You mended. My broken heart, now I'm living</segment8>
		<segment9>Your love is Heaven on Earth. I'll shout it out to all of the world. There's no doubt my greatest dream has come true. Just to be loved by You    </segment9>
