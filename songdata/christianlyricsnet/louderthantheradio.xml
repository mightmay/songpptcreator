		<segment1>I've been standing on the summit. I've been looking for the rain. I've been looking for the cloud to come but maybe not the pain. I've been looking for a miracle I've been looking for a sign. To see some hope come to the world</segment1>
		<segment2>I've been standing with a blazing torch. I've been looking where to run. I've been praying for the faith I need to see your kingdom come. I've been looking in the mirror. I think you need to change. Lets pray that hope comes to the world</segment2>
		<segment3>Everybody round the world come on. We need some love to fall on us. Everybody round the world come on. We need some grace to fall on us</segment3>
		<segment4>I've been standing with the fatherless. We've been learning how to pray. All we're asking is the grace we need to live a better way. We've been longing for the walls to crash that hold us from the truth. Let's pray that hope comes to the world</segment4>
		<segment5>Can you hear the sound that's rising?. From all the corners of the earth. And young and old will stand together. Can you hear the praise? It's louder than the radio!    </segment5>
