		<segment1>we swim sideways. but have we come to this. all we ever had. we lost back there. but i can't even tell just how far it is. or how long the drive. into this world it's all but recompense. all we have is saving grace. gone away mandate never the same. we've made this raft subside. so we're forced to wade from side to side. i know your love is deep and wide    </segment1>
