		<segment1>There's a burning in my heart everyday. I come to you, I look to you and say. When will I become everything that you've intended me to be. I'm beating at my chest everyday. I run to you, I come to you and say. When will I become everything that you've intended me to be. I am so tired, I am so beaten. From walking down the road of shattered dreams. I am so lonely I am so broken. Won't you come, won't you rescure me. I am so tired, I am so tired, I am so tired, I am so tired. [I'll be the light inside of you and won't let go of you]. Come rescure me, won't you come, won't you come. I'm calling out your name    </segment1>
