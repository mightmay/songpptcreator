		<segment1>Mystery of mysteries. That you could love someone like me. In your hands eternity. And yet you have the time for me. A love so undeserved. You held nothing in reserve. Heaven played its symphony. I took your hand you rescued me</segment1>
		<segment2>Grace like a river. Is flowing down. Is flowing down. Grace like a river. It's flowing down to me</segment2>
		<segment3>Staring at my history. Was all alone and never free. The sands of time have let me see. Your faithful shadow next to me. A love so unreserved. I did nothing to deserve. Love so free but what's the cost. To carry this old rugged cross</segment3>
		<segment4>I love you, I thank you. I'm nothing, without your. Grace like a river    </segment4>
