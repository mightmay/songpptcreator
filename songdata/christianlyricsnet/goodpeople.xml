		<segment1>I grew up impressed by the people I knew. in the buckle of the bible belt. hopped in the van with the band. now I've been just about everywhere else. Met a soldier from Seattle and a lawyer from the East. a texas oil baron and a Roman Catholic priest </segment1>
		<segment2>Every day I choose. to walk in their shoes. 'cause pretty are the feet of those. who bring the good news </segment2>
		<segment3>Good people. good, good people. everywhere, everywhere it's God's people </segment3>
		<segment4>Been on the road been far from home. but I found me a friend or two. time has taught me well and I can tell you. the good things people do. they really care and I've been there. seen it with my eyes. you can tell that they're God's people. by the goodness in their lives     </segment4>
