		<segment1>(chorus). Priase Him. Praise Him. Voices raisin'. Priase Him. Praise Him. Voices raisin'</segment1>
		<segment2>Praise Him, my friend, cause He sits on high. He's the Lord God almighty so don't ask why. Just worship Him, adore Him, and sing this praise. Ignite it, don't fight it, light it, leave it ablaze. Let it burn in your heart, stir in your soul. Proclaim honor to the Father as your lifelong goal. So sing allelujah and let the Word ring. Praise Him, voices raise Him as we worship the King</segment2>
		<segment3>(repeat chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>When we praise, we raise the mighty name of the King. We're born again, y'all, we got a song to sing. He died, He's our guide, and we call Him Christ. A man, a hill, a cross and a price. The King of Kings, Rose of Sharon, the Savior of men. He's the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and End. The sure Lord of Lords, the Creator on high. Praise Him, voices raisin' as it rings in the sky</segment4>
		<segment5>(repeat chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>Praise, let's raise the roof tonight. We're children of the Lord, we're soldiers of light. Rejoice, let's voice His name on high. For He has given us all the gift of life</segment6>
		<segment7>(bridge). Let everything that has breath. Praise Him. Praise Him. In one accord unto the Lord. Praise Him</segment7>
		<segment8>Allelu, do the do and begin to rejoice. Sing aloud, y'all, make a joyful noise. Young David used to rave it when he played on his harp. He wrote the Psalms, a book of songs from His heart. Two thousand years later still a craze to praise. Not a phase, stand amazed at the infinate blaze. It's eternal, that's a fact, and I use rap. To bring glory mandatory cause the King will be back</segment8>
