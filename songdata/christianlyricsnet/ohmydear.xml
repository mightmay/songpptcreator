		<segment1>I called you up, you were in bed. Could barely make out the words that you said. But you wanted to see me instead so I got dressed. Then I stepped out into the snow. And walked for a mile or so. Felt the rush of blood come from the cold in my chest</segment1>
		<segment2>You finally came to the door. And we talked for an hour or more. Until I asked if you would stay up till four. You said, &quot;That's fine.&quot;. But you said, &quot;There's something I have to say, And I can't because I'm just so afraid.&quot;. And so I held you as you started to shake that night</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, my dear I'll wait for you. Grace tonight will pull us through</segment3>
		<segment4>Until the tears have left your eyes. Until the fears can sleep at night. Until the demons that you're scared of disappear inside. Until this guilt begins to crack and the weight falls from your back. Oh, my dear I'll keep you in my arms tonight</segment4>
		<segment5>You slowly lifted your head from your hands. You said, &quot;I just don't think that you'll understand, You'll never look at me that way again if you knew what I did.&quot;. And so your tears fell and melted the snow. You told me secrets nobody had known. But I never loved you more even though now I knew what you did</segment5>
