		<segment1>Tonight the stars speak of your infinite love. And it serves to remind me. That what I have means nothing at all. Compared to your glory, Oh lord</segment1>
		<segment2>How long till your voice speaks clearly?. How long till your arms envelope me?. I cry be my strength when I am weak. Oh Lord have mercy on me please</segment2>
		<segment3>My spirit is willing but my flesh is so weak. I cry in your arms now. God grant me the strength to rest in you. I lift my hands and cry.     </segment3>
