		<segment1>There are no words in times like these. When tears don't hide the tragedies. And all you want is a reason for the world</segment1>
		<segment2>No comfort in the greeting card. Cause God is good, But life's still hard. and your heart just wants a reason for the world</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe the reason for the pain. Is so we would pray for strength. And maybe the reason for the strength. Is so that we would not lose hope. And maybe the reason for all hope. Is so that we could face the world. And the reason for the world. Is to make us long for home</segment3>
		<segment4>For God so loved your broken heart. He sent his son to where you are. and he died. To give a reason for the world</segment4>
		<segment5>So lift your sorrows to the one. Whose plan for you has just begun. And rests here in the hands that hold the world</segment5>
		<segment6>Maybe the reason for the pain. Is so we would pray for strength. And maybe the reason for the strength. Is so that we would not lose hope. And maybe the reason for all hope. Is so that we could face the world. And the reason for the world. Is to make us long for home</segment6>
		<segment7>Well I know your past the point of broken. Surrounded by your fear. I know your feet are tired and weary. from the road that you walked down here. But just keep your eyes on heaven. and know that you are not alone. remember the reason for the world</segment7>
		<segment8>No ear has heard, No eye has seen. Not even in your wildest dreams. A beauty that awaits beyond this world. When you look into the eyes of grace. and hear the voice of mercy say. Child, welcome to the reason for the world    </segment8>
