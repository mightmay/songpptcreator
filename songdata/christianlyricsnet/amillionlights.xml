		<segment1>Can we hang out tonight underneath Your ceiling. I could stare up at a million. lights and listen to You breathing. If I fall fast asleep it's just. because I feel so safe in You. It won't take much to wake me up. Could I walk out to sea way beyond these breakers. We have no place amongst the movers and the shakers. Yours is the only throne I'll. ever get down on my knees before. You have the whole of me. Lover come away. Come away my lover. I heard You say You've stolen my. heart with one glance of Your eyes. When I fell down You raised me up. That's gravity. Yours is the only throne I'll. ever get down on my knees before. You have the whole of me. Lover come away. When I fell down you were. standing there waiting for me. You picked me up, welcomed me home. That's gravity. Won't You come away. Won't You come away with my. Lover of my soul    </segment1>
