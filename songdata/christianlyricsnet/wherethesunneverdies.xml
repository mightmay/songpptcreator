		<segment1>I think I saw a place in the distance. We've always known it was there. When I have breathed for the last time. I'll walk out to the end of that pier. There is that place in our conscience. So talk so loud so you won't hear and forget. But I'll still call it home</segment1>
		<segment2>Where the sun never dies. Shine away my shadow. Where it's bright when I shut my eyes. I'll drink until I'm not thirsty. The sun never dies. Shine away my shadow. It's just waiting to rise</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll see You on that day. When I walk those last steps Your way</segment3>
		<segment4>There's something moving in the shadows. There is that rumor of hope. When the spirit starts roaring. For so long we have but no longer will we cope. Love is personified. I'd rather die in love. Than stay alive numb. I'll still call it home. I'm still longing home</segment4>
		<segment5>Where the sun never dies. Shine away my shadow. Where it's bright when I shut my eyes. I'll drink until I'm not thirsty. The sun never dies. Shine away my shadow. It's just waiting to rise</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll see You on that day. When I walk those last steps Your way. I'll see You on that day. When I walk those last steps Your way    </segment6>
