		<segment1>Is it true today that when people pray. Cloudless skies will break. Kings and queens will shake. Yes it's true and I believe it. I'm living for you</segment1>
		<segment2>Is it true today that when people pray. We'll see dead men rise. And the blind set free. Yes it's true and I believe it. I'm living for you</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm gonna be a history maker in this land. I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna run. Into your arms, into your arms again. Into your arms, into your arms again</segment3>
		<segment4>Well it's true today that when people stand. With the fire of God, and the truth in hand. We'll see miracles, we'll see angels sing. We'll see broken hearts making history. Yes it's true and I believe it. We're living for you    </segment4>
