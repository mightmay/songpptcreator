		<segment1>It was a day like today when my Jesus died. Alone in a cross He was crucified. but three days later He rose from the dead. Went up to the heavens a place for us to set. Ain't no joke what He did on earth. Laws of nature broke when he told that girl. get up on your feet and walk. cos she's just asleep not dead like they talk. I see you hanging there. Don't know whats on your mind. I see you hanging there. Hey J are you alright</segment1>
		<segment2>How does it feel to take a nail through your hand. How does it feel to carry the sin of man. How does it feel to be the most broken man. How does it feel to take a nail through your hand</segment2>
		<segment3>How does it feel to see that which You've made. turn against You because of so much hate. You looked down on us tears rolled down your eyes. All you saw was death because of all the lies. If I could see what you saw I know I could cry too. that's why I wanna serve You at least I'll try to. cos even when I was alone You were there for me. Never left me alone cos You care for me    </segment3>
