		<segment1>I see it in your eyes. The pain you keep inside. It's slowly tearing you apart. Though you've run away. Reminded day by day. You've stumbled and you've fallen. Still He's calling</segment1>
		<segment2>I believe that He loves you where you are. I believe that you've seen the hands of God. I believe that you'll know it when. You're back in His arms again</segment2>
		<segment3>I believe that He never let you go. I believe that He's wanting you to know. I believe that He'll lead you 'til. you're back in His arms again</segment3>
		<segment4>Glad I found you here. 'Cause in between the tears. Something in your eyes shows hope. And I stand before you now. As one that knows about. Coming to Him open and broken</segment4>
		<segment5>And I know that He's callin'. He's callin' you Home</segment5>
		<segment6>One life, one love, one way Home. And when you rise and when you fall. He will see you through it all. He is waiting, you are called, back in His arms again.    </segment6>
