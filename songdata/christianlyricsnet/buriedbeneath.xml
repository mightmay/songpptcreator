		<segment1>My eyes have adjusted to dark. And so has my heart. The weight of the world has covered me. Im in over my head. Am I living or dead. Can anyone hear me calling out. Im calling out</segment1>
		<segment2>Im finally breaking. So where are you now. Its been such a long time. That Ive tried to live without. Im suffocating, I need you to breathe. So reach down and pull me up, pull me out. Before I am buried beneath</segment2>
		<segment3>I built this house on the shore. All I wanted was more. Then I felt the sand start shifting. I saw the cracks in the walls. I painted over them all. I tried my best to just ignore. I cant ignore</segment3>
		<segment4>Im finally breaking. So where are you now. Its been such a long time. That Ive tried to live without. Im suffocating, I need you to breathe. So reach down and pull me up, pull me out. Before I am buried beneath</segment4>
		<segment5>I thought I was climbing out. But its dragging me down. Whats hidden here with me. Thought I was alone. But it pulls me deeper now. I cant escape</segment5>
		<segment6>Im finally breaking. So where are you now. Its been such a long time. That Ive tried to live without. Im suffocating, I need you to breathe. So reach down and pull me up, pull me out. Before I am buried beneath    </segment6>
