		<segment1>Midnight in the yard. A dog begins to bark. The next-door neighbor. Shuts her kitchen blinds. Up on the moonlit rise. Joe-Jack sleeps outside. On an old gunnysack. Filled with soda cans </segment1>
		<segment2>Out across the lawn. 2 cats have their fun </segment2>
		<segment3>Epi and Lou on the slippery grass. They tumble and jump in a crazy dance. Look up at the stars like they're in a trance. Climb the willow tree </segment3>
		<segment4>Epi and Louie freeze. They don't blink or breathe. A sudden danger. In the atmosphere. Walking down the road. Sniffing as he goes. An old coyote. His eyes are yellow green </segment4>
		<segment5>Trickster on the prowl. Throws back his head and howls </segment5>
		<segment6>The night heats up when the coyote comes. He won't rest till his work is done. Critters flee when he comes around. Some won't make it home </segment6>
		<segment7>Life is never what it seems. Pull me from this waking dream. I should have come inside. So much guilt, so much regret. Don't let my life be over. Let me come inside. I wanna come inside </segment7>
		<segment8>Epi and Lou run across the yard. They look to the window but it's much too far. They turn and race for the broken car. Barely make it in </segment8>
		<segment9>The night heats up when the coyote comes. He won't rest till his work is done. Every critter flees when he comes around. Some won't make it home    </segment9>
