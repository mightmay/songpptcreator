		<segment1>If You could send a burning bush to Moses. Lead Your people home through a parted sea. Give a boy the strength to defeat Goliath. I know You will always take care of me</segment1>
		<segment2>With You on my side, I am victorious. With You on my side, Ive got nothing to fear. So I can walk through this valley with confidence. Knowing You will deliver me</segment2>
		<segment3>If You could raise the dead bones of Lazarus. If You could feed five-thousand with a couple fish and a loaf of bread. And in the middle of a stormy night You can walk on water. I know, I know, I know nothings out of Your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>If You could pull me out of my sin. And give me new life within. And keep all Your promises. And Your Word is true then. I dont have to be afraid. I know this is the day You made. So no matter what comes my way</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>. (Exodus 3, Exodus 14:21-22, 1 Samuel 17, John 11:38-44, Matthew 14:13-21, Matthew 14:22-25, Romans 15:4)     </segment7>
