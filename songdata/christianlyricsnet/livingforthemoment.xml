		<segment1>He prayed the prayer one Sunday morning. He really meant the words he said. She prayed and gave her heart to Jesus. One night while kneeling by her bed. So many start on this journey. But they never make it out of the door. Their lives are caught in a moment in time. But there's so much more</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Than living for the moment when He's given us a lifetime. Living for the moment, letting hours pass right by. It's gonna take forever to discover all that Jesus has in store. So live for every moment. And live every moment for the Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>There are some mountains on our pathway. Sometimes we reach the very top. We like the feeling of the moment. Sometimes that's where we'd like to stop. But we've been given these moments. To encourage us along the way. Now Jesus wants us to move ahead growin' every day</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. This is the day that the Lord has created. This is the day that He has made. To take us where our faith has never been before</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus </segment6>
		<segment7>. .     </segment7>
