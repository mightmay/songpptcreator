		<segment1>I burnt the bridge that you were building. But I left here feeling guilty. That we couldn't see eye to eye. Why can't we compromise?. Why are we choosing sides?. When will we realize?</segment1>
		<segment2>We don't have to fight anymore. Where is the love we had before?. Wouldn't the world be better off if we decide?. We don't need our pride anymore. Where is the love we had before?. Where is the love.. Where is the love.. Where is the love.. The love we had before</segment2>
		<segment3>You used to be the one I'd run to. But now I tend to run you. Right into the ground. Sorry I was such a fool. Never saw your point of view. Can we start over somehow?</segment3>
		<segment4>You know we only hurt ourselves. When we don't communicate. Why can't we stop and make a change?. Where is the love? Where is the love?    </segment4>
