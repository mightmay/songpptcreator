		<segment1>Give me one more chance tonight. to keep you waiting for nothing. And make you stay here in this place. Where you are only what they say you are</segment1>
		<segment2>You can save the lie, we are the ones. who've seen the other side. Say our own good byes, leaving the world and all our cares behind</segment2>
		<segment3>Give me one more chance today to keep you sitting in one place. Riding on the fence you've made, you're only partly dying this way</segment3>
		<segment4>Am I keeping you from life? or am I keeping you alive?    </segment4>
