	<english>
		<segment1>(verse 1). My eyes are burning, I can't see. Smokey cloud in front of me. Just a nasty habit, you can't break. Still you want to have and eat your cake</segment1>
		<segment2>(pre-chorus). I see you every weekend in the chapel. You wear your Sunday face, but. What do you believe?</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). Give me a reason to not criticize. Cause' you're telling me one thing. And you're living a lie. You're preaching you love him. And you know that he suffered. You got a bible in one hand and. A cigarette in the other (1st time). A Long neck in the other (2nd time). A Condom in the other (3rd time)</segment3>
		<segment4>(verse 2). So you had a little much to drink. Did you ever stop and think?. Jesus didn't die to save your soul. So you could kneel beside a toliet bowl</segment4>
		<segment5>(pre-chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>(verse 3). True love waits, you sign your name. To you sex and love it's just a game. So you count the knotches 1,2,3. But your conscience tells you nothing's free</segment7>
		<segment8>(pre-chorus)</segment8>
		<segment9>(chorus)</segment9>
		<segment10>(ending tag). You're popular, so popular. Does it make you happy?. You're popular, so popular. But does it make you happy, so happy?.     </segment10>
