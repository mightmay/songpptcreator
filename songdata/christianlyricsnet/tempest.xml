		<segment1>Dont touch this. Just look and feel your way through. Cant tough this tempest just yet</segment1>
		<segment2>The hopes and fears in the sirens sounding. Beating hearts, tears as the rain starts pounding</segment2>
		<segment3>Comfort in stereo sirens warning. Still fighting, white lightning blinding, storming</segment3>
		<segment4>Its not in me, but Ill recover it. Its not in me</segment4>
		<segment5>Go run and hide as the storm comes in. Its never enough. Ill be alright and I wont let it in</segment5>
		<segment6>Standing ground, standing with sirens waking. Firmly rooted, ever bending, never breaking</segment6>
		<segment7>Its not in me, but Ill recover it. Its not in me</segment7>
		<segment8>Go run and hide as the storm comes in. Its never enough. Ill be alright and I wont let it in    </segment8>
