		<segment1>I gotta get out of this place Im in so low, so low. Taking everything to heart is breaking me up I know. I know, I know</segment1>
		<segment2>I dont need to know all the things that I know you know. Just the simple fact that you loved me before I was born. Every piece of me that I lose along the way. You pick them up and make me new. You make me new</segment2>
		<segment3>I gotta get out of this phase Im in I know,I know. Run out of the gates as fast as I can go, can go. I need to go.     </segment3>
