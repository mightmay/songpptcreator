		<segment1>Slipped away out of my hands like a soap once again. Hey what a day, gone for the night and then. Run back home and tuck yourself in for a needed sleep. For another work-week, what a day what a day. Then wake up, oh no, sunset, I missed another day. One slap on the cheek and out the door. Running and running and coming closer to stumbling. If you run with a knife, you fall. You stick a hole in that bubble called life. But my weapon is clean and I'm ready to go. Run nicotine, caffeine through my veins. To wake up, catch up, but it seems like</segment1>
		<segment2>Ohhh. I've been living in slow motion. I've been living in slow motion</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold your breath and count to three. Not me, I've got to see what's around the corner ok. One two three.. I've got to have air. Stumbling around spinning the disco ball faster. More of everything. It smells like burning rubber under my shoes. But I'm always one step behind, one minute too late. Hey operator, could you connect me with a respirator. I'm running after life like a dog on a leech. But life keeps slipping away</segment3>
		<segment4>Ohhh. I've been living in slow motion. I've been living in slow motion</segment4>
		<segment5>We make it a hard synchronize. Stuck stuck stuck stuck in the lies you better. Leave leave because so many times. I run 50 miles an hour and I get sick sick sick. Wait wait I can't hold your breath. Stay stay won't let you go away. I'll stay and sleep with the lions. If you say you won't go away</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been running. I've been running out of time</segment6>
		<segment7>I've been living in, I've been living in slow motion    </segment7>
