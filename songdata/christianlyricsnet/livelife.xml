		<segment1>As the years have passed me by. I have laughed and I have cried. I have so many things that I regret. And I have seen what it means. To take a stand and to believe. To hold every given moment close to me. But nothing compares to Your love. The love You gave to me</segment1>
		<segment2>Live life, live free. You cut the chains that once held me. You held the key, opened up eternity. Your mercy and sweetness when I felt so worthless. You broke down my walls and made me see</segment2>
		<segment3>Since I heard Your name. I have never been the same. Jesus, You're so precious to me. Beautiful Savior, Redeemer and Healer. You're everything that I'll ever need. Nothing compares to Your love. The blood You shed to me</segment3>
		<segment4>It's more beautiful than diamonds and pearls. More mysterious than when a boy meets a girl. It's deeper than an ocean of blue shining. down just to reach to you. It's more heavenly than angels with wings. More musical than voices and strings. It makes you feel like dancing again, makes you want to sing    </segment4>
