		<segment1>To raise majestic mountains. To cause the sea to roar. To brush a crimson setting sun. To make the eagle soar. To bring the newborn cry of life. The hope of every spring. These treasures are the pleasures of the King </segment1>
		<segment2>To see His people flourish. To live in light of day. To watch His children grow to know. The wonders of His way. To feel the joys of ransomed hearts. And all His mercies bring. These treasures are the pleasures of the King. These treasures are the pleasures of the King </segment2>
		<segment3>To heal a broken body. To mend a broken heart. To knit together healthy homes. That once lay torn apart. To glory in the praises that. His grateful children sing. These treasures are the pleasures of the King </segment3>
		<segment4>But of all His regal pleasures. One does stand above the rest. The Son He gave to serve and save. In perfect holiness </segment4>
		<segment5>Existing pure and faultless. Embodiment of Truth. Guardian of righteousness. With name beyond reproof. His words uphold the universe. In love unwavering. Jesus, You are the treasure of the King. Jesus, You are the pleasure of the King </segment5>
