		<segment1>The impossible is possible. But your fear is so responsible for keeping you down, keeping you down. Your unreachable is reachable. But you'll never grab. The wonderful. with your feet on the ground, your feet on the ground</segment1>
		<segment2>Bridge: If you fall on your face. Don't just leave it to fate. No such thing as too late. It's not too late</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: To start over, start over, start over. Start over, start over, start over. You never have what you want to lose. So pick it up, up, up. Dust off your shoes. Start over, start over, start over. Start over, start over, start over. You've gotta find, find, find the other side, So give it one, one, one more try. Start over</segment3>
		<segment4>You only fail. If you never try. You'll never live. Tryin' not to die. I'm telling you now, I'm telling you now. Don't ever stop, Give all you've got. Don't hesitate, to take a shot. It all comes around, it all comes around.</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>There's so much, so much left to gain. There's so much, so much to lose. You'll never know until know until you make a move.</segment7>
		<segment8>Bridge</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus</segment9>
		<segment10>Start over, start over, start over. Start over, start over, start over. Start over    </segment10>
