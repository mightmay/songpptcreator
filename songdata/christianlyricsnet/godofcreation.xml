		<segment1>It's the way Your stars shine. Sometimes so bright I swear I could hear. It's the way Your moonlight. Falls on this mountain lake so clear. It's the way Your sunshine. Paints Your evening sky and. It's the way Your rain falls. To sing me to sleep at night and. I fall, I fall into You</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: God of Creation take my breath away. God of the Heavens in this very space [2x]</segment2>
		<segment3>Bridge: You enter suddenly and I am lost again. Inside the majesty, oh I am lost again. And You come suddenly, 'cause I am lost again. Inside the myster, oh I am lost again. I am lost again. Inside the majesty. Inside the mystery</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus [4x]    </segment4>
