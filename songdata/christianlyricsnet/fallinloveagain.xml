		<segment1>Each night I sit alone. I dial you on the phone. But you're not there. Oh are you there?. Can't keep my heart from breaking. Can't keep my mind from thinking. You're not here. I need you here</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS(*): But just because you feel alone. It doesn't mean we're letting go. I will be with you 'til the very end..</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: So don't close your eyes. Don't say goodbye. Don't let the tears fall. from your eyes. I can't help but think about you night and day. When you stumble. When you fall. I'll help you make it through it all. 'Cause when I think of you. I fall in love again</segment3>
		<segment4>Can't teach my heart to listen. Oh it just keeps on missing how it was. The memories of. You right there by my side oh. Never dreamed of letting go. But now you're gone. It feels so wrong</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>I believe in faith above. In giving everlasting love. I believe there is a chance for us</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
