		<segment1>Whenever this world gets the best of me. And it all goes wrong. ICount down the hours till we meet. And I move along. 'cause I know that when I see you I will be. Chorus: Happy as the sun, lighter than a feather. Walking on the clouds when we are together. Every day with just keeps getting better. The world's as it should be, when are you here with me. Whenever you leave, my heart skips a beat. Unless you are here, I am incomplete. Like an undone song. Only you inspire the melody in me. (Chorus). How could I go wrong. When you are here with me. How could I be anything but smiling. (Chorus). The worlds as it should be. When you are here, when you are here. When you are here with me.     </segment1>
