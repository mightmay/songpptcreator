		<segment1>I am free. for the first time. left my fears behind. in front of me is open sky</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm taller than trees. I can see further than before. everything's different now. now that You've ruined my life</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). You took my dreams. and stole my schemes. and turned my life upside-down. You took my heart. stole every part. and made it a miracle</segment3>
		<segment4>now I can sing, sing a new song. my burden's gone. you gave me all the words and melodies</segment4>
		<segment5>and now I can be at Your feet. Your place for me. everything's beautiful. now that You've ruined my life</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>and I'm wide awake. and tonight I'm saved. in Your arms I'm singin' of. how You made me a miracle</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm taller than trees. I can see further than before. everything's different now</segment8>
		<segment9>(chorus x2).     </segment9>
