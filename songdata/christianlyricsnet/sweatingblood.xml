		<segment1>Suffering and glory are the greatest powers that history has ever seen. I want to live a life worth writing about and more, because I lived a life, a life worth dying for.</segment1>
		<segment2>Faith! .. Walk with me!</segment2>
		<segment3>We have made it my friends, were the closest generation to the end. They will never silence us with torture or in their prisons. We have made it my friends, were the closest generation to the end. They will never silence us with torture or in their prisons.</segment3>
		<segment4>Tears will roll down our cheeks and our souls will get restless, but we will not be afraid of the lions teeth in our face. I will grab the beast by his mane and scream at the top of my lungs.</segment4>
		<segment5>We have made it my friends, were the closest generation to the end. They will never silence us with torture or in their prisons. We have made it my friends, were the closest generation to the end. They will never silence us with torture or in their prisons.</segment5>
		<segment6>Our love is stronger than death. I will never deny my faith. I will never deny my faith. I will never deny my faith (my faith). Forever!    </segment6>
