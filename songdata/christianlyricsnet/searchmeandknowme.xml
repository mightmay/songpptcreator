		<segment1>h my Lord, You search and You know me. You know when I sit, You know when I rise. You know what I think, You know where I'm going. Nothing oh Lord, can hide from Your eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>You close me in, behind and before me. You shield me with Your mighty hand. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me. Too much for me to understand</segment2>
		<segment3>Where can I go to flee from Your Spirit?. And from Your presence where can I hide?. Behold up in heaven You're there beside me. In the depths of the darkness You're by my side</segment3>
		<segment4>And if I rise on the wings of the morning. Or settle on the far side of the sea. Even there Your hand will guide me. For Your right hand is holding me</segment4>
		<segment5>And if I say the darkness will hide me. The night will shine as bright as day. So search me Lord and lovingly lead me. In Your everlasting Way    </segment5>
