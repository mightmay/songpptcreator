		<segment1>Some might. Some might sell out on the birthrite. Never shy. And you never shot a bird right. But you're taking on the worst shine. You're taking on the worst shine. With the hairiness you never had</segment1>
		<segment2>Some might. Sell out on the wrong side. In the corner of his eye    </segment2>
