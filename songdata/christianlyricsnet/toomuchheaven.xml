		<segment1>Chorus: Nobody gets too much heaven no more. It's much harder to come by. I'm waiting in line. Nobody shows too much love any more. It's as high as a mountain but harder to climb. Ooo, I'm here to let you know there's a pie beyond the sky</segment1>
		<segment2>Made of pearly gates precious streets of. gold no more painful tears to cry. In my mind we will live in love forever. Peace will always reign and never die. Love is such a beautiful thing. So just take his hand, put your mind at ease. He will take you there, if you just believe</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>Ooo, take a look around, there's confusion everywhere. People running wild to the homeless child. And it seems that no one cares. Something's wrong. When will all this hate be over. Time is come to write a different song. Love is such a beautiful thing ooh, yeah. We need to understand with an open mind. We can change the world, just give love a try. Nobody gets. Nobody gets too much heaven no more</segment4>
		<segment5>It's much harder to come by. I'm waiting in line. I'm waiting in line what about love. Nobody shows too much love any more. It's as high as a mountain but harder to climb. It's the hardest mountain to climb. Love is such a beautiful thing. So just take his hand. Put your mind at ease. He will take you there if you just believe. Believe    </segment5>
