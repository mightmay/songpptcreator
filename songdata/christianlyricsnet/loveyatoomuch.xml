		<segment1>I couldn't sleep tonight. 'Cause you were on my mind. We've been friends so long. I treated you wrong, that's not right. I said some crazy things. Words I did not mean. Can I take back the lies. Can I apologize </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I love ya too much. I love ya just the way you are. And I love ya too much. To ever let you down. And I love ya too much. You know I wanna wrap my heart around you. Love ya too much. To ever let you go. I want you to know. I've had good friends before. But none have loved me more. I can't remember who was ever as true as you are. I get emotional. 'Cause I'm an ocean full. Of dreams that we can share and hope to get us there. Chorus </segment2>
		<segment3>On and on and on </segment3>
		<segment4>Together we go on. So far now from where we belong. We won't slow down, won't stop now. Givin' up won't do. Take a chance on me. I'll take my chances on you </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus    </segment5>
