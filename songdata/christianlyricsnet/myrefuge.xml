		<segment1>I take my refuge in the palm of Your hand. I take my comfort in Your perfect plan. I take my sorrow and lay it down at Your feet. I take my refuge where I can be free</segment1>
		<segment2>In You, Oh Lord. In You, my God. When there's no where to turn. And there's nothing that's true. I find my peace here in You (2x)</segment2>
		<segment3>I take my shelter in the shade of Your wings. I take my pleasure in the hope that You bring. I take my weakness to the foot of the cross. I take my refuge where I can get lost</segment3>
		<segment4>I worship You, Lord. For all that You are. I stretch out my faith. And lay down my heart. There's no where else. That I'd rather be. Than where there's more You, Lord. And where there's less me</segment4>
		<segment5>In You, Oh Lord. In You, my God. When there's no where to turn. And there's nothing that's true. I find my peace here in You (2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>I will worship You with all my heart, my soul. I will worship You with all my mind, my strength. (2x)    </segment6>
