		<segment1>Don't you understand me?. This cloud over my head is not okay. There are things that I need to get done. The burden I have been carrying is not my idea of fun, and it doesn't give you permission to take a shot below the belt. We have so little time, let's not spend it in anger. I am in the deep end and can't find air. I am throwing punches with a blindfold on. Stop riding my tail with your high beams on, because I may just brake suddenly. I would rather not explode  that's your job. I'm stuck in between two worlds in a maze of dreams and thoughts. What a bittersweet symphony life is, but I wouldn't have it any other way.    </segment1>
