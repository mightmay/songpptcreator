		<segment1>Living everyday and I keep putting on my mask. I wanna change, but I'm too insecure to ask. Would receive it, I need to see it. Or would you laugh it all off and make-believe it. Why do I hate what I have become. It seems the more that I try the less I overcome. And I can't rewind the hands of time and try to find. Where I was blind and change my mind. I see the way you're living and it's starting to make me sick. You have the cure and I'd do anything to it. My thoughts scrambled, my mind mangled. The confusion is more than what I can handle. Please give me what I need. My eyes can't see this clearly. Please give me what I need. Show me the Way. A little bit of nothing is a whole lot of what I've got. I'll keep on giving and I'll give it my very best shot. Keep my eyes on getting the prize won. I'm never going back to the place where I came from. Hey, you know, this might be worth it. Even though I know that I don't deserve it. My breathe I wasted, defeat I tasted. Now it's all gone and His love replaced it. I kiss it good-bye, yes I kiss it good-bye, oh. I never want to see it again that right, yo. Taunt me, flaunt me, even try to haunt me. Try to slow me down, but I know you'll never stop me. You gave me what I need. My eyes now se so clearly. You gave me what I need. You showed me the Way    </segment1>
