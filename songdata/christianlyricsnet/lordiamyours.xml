		<segment1>Lord, I am Yours. I will live in Your Love. Lord, heres my heart. Here is faith in Your Love. Your mercy sustains me. The	knowledge	of Your presence	upholds. Your goodness surrounds me. You cover the weakness of my soul. Im Yours, and I will live in Your Love. Not my will, but Thine be done. Take these years that I have run. From Your Love and Your wisdom. Lord, I surrender my life    </segment1>
