		<segment1>You can run but Ill be here waiting. For your return when you get frustrated. Im the only one who loves you without condition</segment1>
		<segment2>Here I am</segment2>
		<segment3>I will, I will be here waiting, waiting. I will, I will be still Ill never change now. I will, I will be here waiting, waiting. I will, I will be still I never tell a lie. Im a rock and you can stand on me. Whenever youre lost Im the road that you need to take. This world is crazy and its not the safest place to be</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, come with me</segment4>
		<segment5>You can run, but Ill be here waiting. For your return when you get so frustrated</segment5>
		<segment6>Im right here    </segment6>
