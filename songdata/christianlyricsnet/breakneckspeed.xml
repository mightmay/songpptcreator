		<segment1>Another day in the hurt. Another grope in the search. Another shove with a smirk. Once more treading, running, pleading, pushing onto. Another bridge through the mist. Another hole in the midst. Another edge to the cliff. With her soft, sweet, subtle final kiss</segment1>
		<segment2>Say, say, say what you will. So sorry. I will never be confined to follow you. So sorry. So you can say, say, say what you will. So sorry. Despite your offer there is nothing in you for me</segment2>
		<segment3>Another stab in the dark, yeah. Another stake through the heart, yeah. Another plea to depart. Now I'm reaching forward, racing to her arms. And with a cruel embrace, yeah. Another end to the chase, yeah. Another falling from grace. Into cunning, cold, crafty web of lace</segment3>
		<segment4>Say, say, say what you will. So sorry. I will never be confined to follow you. So sorry. So you can say, say, say what you will. So sorry. Despite your offer there is nothing in you for me</segment4>
		<segment5>Sink in her wine. Why would I want anyone else?. She took from me. My everything. My everything</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh!</segment6>
		<segment7>So sorry, so sorry, so sorry for all this. So sorry, so sorry, so sorry for all of this. I wish that things could have been so very different for us. I wish that you could have been, I wish that you could have been, I wish that you could have been my everything. So sorry. So long. It's been so real    </segment7>
