		<segment1>Was it perfection that you've wanted. It always added up to be your fall to your mistake. You've wanted it to be inside your worst belief </segment1>
		<segment2>Was it another thing you started. It always added up to be your fall to your mistakes. You've want it to be His voice that calls your name</segment2>
		<segment3>And I'm sorry for all those things in me. And when I don't care I know you're always there</segment3>
		<segment4>I just wanted to get this started    </segment4>
