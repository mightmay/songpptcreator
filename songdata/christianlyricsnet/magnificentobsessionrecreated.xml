		<segment1>Lord, You know how much. I want to know so much. In the way of answers and explanations. I have cried and prayed. And still I seem to stay. In the middle of lifes complications. All this pursuing leaves me feeling like Im chasing down the wind. But now its brought me back to You. And I can see again</segment1>
		<segment2>This is everything I want. This is everything I need. I want this to be my one consuming passion. Everything my heart desires. Lord, I want it all to be for You, Jesus. Be my magnificent obsession</segment2>
		<segment3>So capture my heart again. Take me to depths Ive never been. Into the riches of Your grace and Your mercy. Return me to the cross. And let me be completely lost. In the wonder of the love. That Youve shown me. Cut through these chains that tie me down to so many lesser things. Let all my dreams fall to the ground. Until this one remains</segment3>
		<segment4>You are everything I want. You are everything I need. I want You to be my one consuming passion. Everything my heart desires. Lord, I want it all to be for You. I want it all to be for You</segment4>
		<segment5>You are everything I want. And You are everything I need. Lord, You are all my heart desires. You are everything to me    </segment5>
