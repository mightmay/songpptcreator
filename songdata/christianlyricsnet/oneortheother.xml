		<segment1>I watched you through star struck eyes as you fell down. The words you spoke, I'd like to think they were sincere. Now I've found my way back stage. I've filled my mouth with what's to taste.</segment1>
		<segment2>And what I'm saying man is, yeah I see, I understand. and I can't blame you. I know you had to. It was one or the other; it was you or your brother.</segment2>
		<segment3>And should he change your mind;. bring you around;. clear the smoke, I really hope to see you there. We'll reminisce when we're upstairs. When it comes around who really cares?</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS 2X]. (it was you.)    </segment4>
