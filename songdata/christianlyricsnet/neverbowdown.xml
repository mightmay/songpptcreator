		<segment1>Take me from my home. Drag me with the tether. Tell me it's all wrong. The things I've always known. Instill in me all that you think. Will make all of us better. Do just what you want. It matters not to me</segment1>
		<segment2>I will never bow down. though I know I will be saved from the fire. I will never compromise. All that I have and everything I hold</segment2>
		<segment3>Call us all around. To show us what you have made. Command us all to fall. When the music starts to play</segment3>
		<segment4>And everyone from everywhere. Will show you their allegiance. Bu the child of God. Will faithfully stand tall    </segment4>
