		<segment1>It seemed like I had run out of second chances. And they sentenced me to die. And I was just like a dead man walking. I was running out of time</segment1>
		<segment2>But you came to me and opened my eyes. You gave me a brand new life</segment2>
		<segment3>I am innocent and I have been set free. I no longer have chains around my feet. And no matter where I go or what they say. I am innocent</segment3>
		<segment4>Many years have passed since the day that I met you. But your words are still the same. And every time I find myself with joy or sadness. I am calling out your name</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause you came to me and opened my eyes. You gave to me a brand new life.     </segment5>
