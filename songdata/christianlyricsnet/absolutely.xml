		<segment1>. Lover of my soul. I want to tell You. Only You have all of me</segment1>
		<segment2>I cannot contain. My adoration. I'm in love so desperately</segment2>
		<segment3>No one is as lovely as You are. And there is no one else who has my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus, You have me completely. Every breath that I breathe. I am absolutely in love. Jesus, I am Yours forever. All of me surrenders. I am absolutely in love with You</segment4>
		<segment5>Down upon my knees. I'm lost in worship. Humbled by Your majesty</segment5>
		<segment6>What is there to say. But how I love You. Thank You for forgiving me</segment6>
		<segment7>All I am is Yours. Only Yours    </segment7>
