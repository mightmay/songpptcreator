		<segment1>Walk the gauntlet of lies. Who will it be today.. Secrets of this place, never knowing.. Follow the ones that consume, becoming just like them. Fade away among the crowds, again.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I can read the stains inside your mind, remains of the beauty. And I can hope for the silence of your words, cause I know Ill be caught here..</segment2>
		<segment3>And I could never really find the answers, always locked inside of something so close. And I could never really find the reasons, just assumed it was you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Pushed in a corner where screams die, fighting to stay alive. Cower down to be alone. Nothing is worth this. When is the right time to let it all go?. Not that it matters..but I fear, I fear that someday. itll find its way to you.</segment4>
		<segment5>I could never really find the answers, always locked inside of something so close. I could never really find the reasons, just assumed it was you.</segment5>
		<segment6>I could never really find the answers, always locked inside of something so close. I could never really find the reasons, just assumed it was you.    </segment6>
