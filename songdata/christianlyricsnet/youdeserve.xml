		<segment1>You put a song in my mouth. A Hymn of praise to You. Many are Your wonders. Who is there like You?</segment1>
		<segment2>All my heart and all my love. And all my life You deserve</segment2>
		<segment3>Your beauty lies within my heart. Your glory I can see. And so I sing. And lift my hands to You. I stand upon Your matchless love. I stand upon Your truth. And so I sing. And lift my heart to You</segment3>
		<segment4>You're more. Than all I've ever dreamed of. You're everything I'll ever need. I stand amazed at all Your beauty. Oh God, You deserve, Oh God, You deserve, Oh God, You deserve all of me    </segment4>
