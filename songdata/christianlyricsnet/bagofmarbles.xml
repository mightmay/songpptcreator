		<segment1>Give me one reason and Ill give you more. It seems Im not what she was looking for. I was waiting for something. I found out that its nothing</segment1>
		<segment2>Never act that way. (and then lets talk about growing old). Never say those things boy. (and forget all that you know). You will love this pain. (Youve got nowhere to go). and you will play her games. and do what youre told</segment2>
		<segment3>Im happy with or without you. You make your choices. And become what you choose. Break an organ thats mended. And fake who youre in love with</segment3>
		<segment4>Never act that way. (and then lets talk about growing old). Never say those things boy. (and forget all that you know). You will love this pain. (Youve got nowhere to go). and you will play her games. and do what youre told</segment4>
		<segment5>Tell me that Distance is why we fight. Though youre not like other guys. Everything that I say is right. Tell me that I hate and I envy your God. Life is a meaningless song. Hope and true love all have gone</segment5>
		<segment6>Ill never act that way. (and then lets talk about growing old). Ill never play your games girl. (I am letting go). Youre not what I need. (Now I really see). and you are what I leave. I have never felt this free    </segment6>
