		<segment1>When I meet a special girl. She always lives somewhere else in the world. Don't want to call her on the phone. Wanna talk to her when I'm at home </segment1>
		<segment2>Drop out of school and run away. Quit your job, you got a place to stay. Pack your bags and hitch a ride. Bremerton's a good place to reside </segment2>
		<segment3>Move to Bremerton - we'll hang out. Move to Bremerton - we'll go all out. Move to Bremerton - will you be mine?. (Move to Bremerton til' the end of time) </segment3>
		<segment4>I'll change the street signs you drive down. So you end up in my town. I'll re-draw the maps all one by one. So they all lead to Bremerton </segment4>
		<segment5>Drop out of school and run away. Quit your job, you got a place to stay. Pack your bags and hitch a ride. Bremerton's a good place to reside </segment5>
