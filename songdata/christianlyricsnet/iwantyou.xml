		<segment1>Free and unconditional. Your love. I'm speechless. Lasting, unerasable. Jealous, unexplainable. Your love. I need it</segment1>
		<segment2>I want You. I want You. I want You. Alone. I want You. I want You. I want You. Alone</segment2>
		<segment3>The day You made the sacrifice. You dressed me in the purest white. Your bride is grateful. Desperate now for You to come. Establish Your Kingdom. Until then. I'll be faithful</segment3>
		<segment4>I want You. I want You. I want You. Alone. I want You. I want You. I want You. Alone</segment4>
		<segment5>Your presence is thick. Filling this place. I close my eyes and I imagine Your face. With my head on Your chest. I savor Your embrace. You pull me so close. And then I hear You say</segment5>
		<segment6>I want you. I want you. I want you. Alone. I want you. I want you. I want you. Alone    </segment6>
