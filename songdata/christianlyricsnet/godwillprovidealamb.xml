		<segment1>Three day's journey to the sacred place. A boy and a man with a sorrowful face. Tortured, yet faithful to God's command. To take the life of his son. With his own hands</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: God will provide a lamb. To be offered up in your place. A sacrifice so spotless and clean. To take all your sin away</segment2>
		<segment3>There's wood and fire. Where's the sacrifice. The questioning voice. And the innocent eyes. Is the son of laughter who you've waited for. To die like a lamb. To please the LORD</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>A gleaming knife. An accepted choice. A rush of wind. And an angel's voice. A ram in the thicket. Caught by his horns. And a new age of trusting the Lord is born</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>God has provided a lamb. He was offered up in your place. What Abraham was asked to do, he's done. He's offered his only son</segment7>
		<segment8>What Abraham was asked to do, he's done. He's offered his only son    </segment8>
