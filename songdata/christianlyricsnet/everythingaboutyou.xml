		<segment1>You chased me. I caught you. so glad we found each other. We whispered forever. to share our lives together. to watch our dreams unfold</segment1>
		<segment2>*Chorus. And I love everything about you. everything you are. You'd catch a falling star. if I asked you. And I couldn't live a single day without you. You hold me in your arms. and once again, I know. that I'm the only one for you</segment2>
		<segment3>The way you laugh, the way we dance. the way you hold my hand. the way you give, the way you kiss. the way you look at me. you make life beautiful</segment3>
		<segment4>*Repeat chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>*bridge. Oh, I love the light that shines in your eyes. when you talk about our girls. and love the way you smile when they walk. into a room. Oh, I love how you care about brokenness. how injustice moves your heart enough. to make a change. You give all you are. everyday</segment5>
		<segment6>*Repeat chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>I love everything about you. You hold me in your arms. and once again I know. that I'm the only one for you. the only one for you. the love of my life. So glad I found you. yeah..     </segment7>
