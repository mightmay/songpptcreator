		<segment1>Take the train, go separate ways. And leave it long forgotten. I'll hang my hat and I won't be back. On my way out</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm feelin' lame, am I to blame. Or am I just too jaded. I won't be back, what you think of that?</segment2>
		<segment3>When it feel like life's wastin' away. I can say</segment3>
		<segment4>That when there's something on my mind. That takes my concentration. Just wanna lay it on the line. Avoid all confrontation. I'm gonna say this one more time. For all my generation. You'll never, ever pull my lever. Not today and not forever</segment4>
		<segment5>Take the fame and change my name. Because my jacket's fading. I'll change my hat (no we can't have that). (now you're lookin' at a brand new cat). It's all made up, I've had enough of this circulation. If you write me back I'll tell you where it's at</segment5>
		<segment6>When it feel like life's wastin' away. I can say</segment6>
		<segment7>That when there's something on my mind. That takes my concentration. Just wanna lay it on the line. Avoid all confrontation. I'm gonna say this one more time. For all my generation. You'll never, ever pull my lever. Not today and not forever     </segment7>
