		<segment1>now that we're one. now softly whispers saving grace. 6:19 as I awake. and stronger than last year. my eyes closed - the stars can see me. stars will meet me on the ground. summer's gone. and winter is never too far now. and my poor arms outstretched so long. that my bones are now breaking. but there you come with a smile. that'd send any man to his knees. and I feel I've begun. now that we're one now</segment1>
		<segment2>you graciously add to I. graciously add you to my heart    </segment2>
