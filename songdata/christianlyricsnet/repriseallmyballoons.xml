		<segment2>The words I wrote are a broken chain. Holding me from the criminally insane. But its gone and there's no stopping. All my balloons are popping</segment2>
		<segment3>But the tree was not yet down as she lifted the flag from the bloody. ground, whispering: 'Gallons of gas and a makeshift cast and I'm still no further from nowhere. fast'. Listen! Downstairs the doorbell's ringing. We've been waiting. I've been waiting</segment3>
		<segment4>The words I wrote are a broken chain. Holding me from the criminally insane. But its gone and there's no stopping. All my balloons are popping</segment4>
		<segment5>The words I wrote are a broken chain. Keeping me from the criminally insane. But it's gone and there's no stopping</segment5>
		<segment6>The words I wrote and the songs I sang. Kept this ship from sinking to its grave. But it's gone and there's no stopping. All my balloons are popping</segment6>
