		<segment1>everyone. is pushing into me. and now the sun. is shining into morning. i try. and remember your name. i try, but it's never the same. build it out a mile wide. high enough that you can hide. make it out of what might have been. you say youll come out, but when?. down below, reddening the surface. you're bleeding so, what ever made you nervous?. blush, a dead giveaway. hush, theres nothing to say. you spend the night. alone in reflection. haunted by the question. but is it right just waiting for an answer?. well, no one ever answers    </segment1>
