		<segment1>You walk around in the wastelands. Turning coal into diamonds. You make things right that were broken. And unsalvageable like me</segment1>
		<segment2>You make all things new. My heart is the proof. Up above and underground. What is lost will be </segment2>
		<segment3>Found will be found. I am found in You. I am found its all so different now. That Im found in You</segment3>
		<segment4>You walk around in the dark lands. Shining light on your children. You make a way through the wilderness. Our twisted ways made straight again</segment4>
		<segment5>All thats old will pass away. You alone will stay the same. Oh, your love will remain. Yes, your love will remain</segment5>
