		<segment1>As soon as You stepped through my door. I saw You for the first time all over again. Time well spent seems lonelier than ever. Like light years ago. As I smell You for the first time all over again. I begin to remember to be alive. So if You don't mind. I think I'll wear my heart on my sleeve. Cause I'm tired of not being able to bleed</segment1>
		<segment2>All of us are searching for an open arm. And it's a shame how I curl up in the dark. When it's the same old word giving me the spark. All of us are searching for an open arm. And it's a shame how I curl up in the dark</segment2>
		<segment3>I've felt a loss for some time. I slipped stumbled but fell face first. Straight into Your hand. Hit my head on Your palm. Waking up to the smell. Of fears dying up in the sand</segment3>
		<segment4>All of us are searching for an open arm. And it's a shame how I curl up in the dark. When it's the same old word giving me the spark. All of us are searching for an open arm. And it's a shame how I curl up in the dark</segment4>
		<segment5>I wash my wounds with tears of hope</segment5>
		<segment6>All of us are searching for an open arm. And it's a shame how I pull myself apart. When it's the same word making me run for cover to. Your heart.     </segment6>
