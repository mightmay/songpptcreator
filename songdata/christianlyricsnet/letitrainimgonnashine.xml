		<segment1>I'm livin' in the same ald skin. Inside I got a whole new spin. I'm never gonna change my made up mind</segment1>
		<segment2>When the skies have turned to rain. I won't hide what I contain. It'll be alright I've seen the light. It guides me on my way</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Let it rain on me. Let it rain on me. Let it rain down on me. I'm gonna shine</segment3>
		<segment4>No way I'm gonna lose control. Now that you've come to save my soul. Nobody's gonna change the way I shine</segment4>
		<segment5>When the sky has lost it's blue. I know I will make it through. It'll be alright I've seen the light. I depend on you</segment5>
		<segment6>I won't go back again. Oh that's just fine. With you until the end. My light will shine    </segment6>
