		<segment1>The world keeps on turning. and you're locked up in it. 4x. Before I was lost, but now I'm found 4x.. seeking the wise 4x.. I'm in like that and I'm right on time. I'm looking for the king and will find the way, the truth, and the one that gives life. Payable on death and we're seeking the wise. Nowhere to run looking for the son. No where to run. 2x. You are, you are the one 2x. &quot;DIRT&quot; representing &quot;Shadow of the Locusts&quot;. I'm breathing dust of conspiracies, inquinties infiltrate the wisdom, ubt we bounce back, and burn like the sun. I'm needing help like welfare recpients, while false prophets. keep writing fake manuscripts. Brought down like fugatives, saints on the warpath, watch how you live. Oh God, please make me capable, cause all human wisdom is fallible.    </segment1>
