		<segment1>Life is granted by an unforseen force. We are but molecules in motion and nothing more?. Survival of the fittest is a dark tale. Sending my generation to the depths of hell. Inventors of evil and the secrets of men. Worthy of misery, worth of death. The pages of the old teach. That the treasures of heaven are filth of the earth. I will not turn my eyes. I will not ignore their cries. (We have turned sanctity of life. Into a septic tank of living). Oh wretched animals' this is terror, This is darkness, this is the human heart. Set me apart because when rejection leads to oppression, I proclaim in the loudest. I curse &quot;modern day consumption&quot;. And the chambers that execute them. Orphans come home. Life is granted by an unforseen force. We are but molecules in motion and nothing more?. Survival of the fittest is a dark tale. Sending my generation to the depths of hell. Through the tears I see the beauty of you. The night is over the morning is dawning. The pages of the old teach. That the treasures of heaven are filth of the earth. I will not turn my eyes. I will not ignore their cries. Orphans come home. The Kingdom is yours. Orphans come home    </segment1>
