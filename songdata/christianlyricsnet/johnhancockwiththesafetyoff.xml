		<segment1>Cure the radio. Cure the airwaves. Cure the video. Cure the satellites</segment1>
		<segment2>Well lend you an oxygen flask. To quench your collapse at last. Were beaming in pearl and white. Cause finally your povertys mine </segment2>
		<segment3>Youe probably wondering how we came out alive. While we are laughing while you bury your eyes. Youre probably wondering how we came out alive. Never forget our only reason to live. is to die</segment3>
		<segment4>Cure the Radio. Cure the Airwaves. Cure the video. Cure the satelllites</segment4>
		<segment5>Solutions of silver and chrome. In broadcasts of pirate hopes. These portraits of assets have turned. From pictures into revolvers</segment5>
		<segment6>From sand you were made. to sand you return</segment6>
		<segment7>Come Down. And rise to our level</segment7>
		<segment8>Let all the world know the prisoners took flight. And watch the city streets as towers ignite. The former kings and all their armies burn bright. While we sit back in all the glory tonight. Youre probably wondering how we came out alive. Never forget our only reason to live.    </segment8>
