		<segment1>Overzealous to say the least. Underestimated, how far you could reach. How could we know, How far you'd go, Behind our backs to make sure your point is heard?. You're better than us all. </segment1>
		<segment2>Does it really matter how far you go?. Can you get some sleep now, standing on so many toes? </segment2>
		<segment3>Do what you do when you say what you want to say, With or without regard for me. Scheme what you scheme when you're thinking of yourself, You're the most likely to succeed. </segment3>
		<segment4>Now that my purpose has been served, Make a caste system for a modern world. Your motto rings, &quot;Tomorrow brings, Another life to underrate, To belittle and humiliate.&quot; </segment4>
		<segment5>Does it really matter how far you go?. Can you get some sleep now, standing on so many toes? </segment5>
		<segment6>Do what you do when you say what you want to say, With or without regard for me. Scheme what you scheme when you're thinking of yourself, You're the most likely to succeed. The yearbook said that you'd be another winner, You forgot what success should mean. The poster child for becoming homeless, Mr. Most Likely to Succeed. </segment6>
		<segment7>And as you go, Call to mind the things you've come to know. Be sure to wave goodbye, On that day you die, To all that you wanted, You're leaving behind. </segment7>
		<segment8>Do what you do when you say what you want to say, With or without regard for me. Scheme what you scheme when you're thinking of yourself, You're the most likely to succeed. The yearbook said that you'd be another winner, You forgot what success should mean. The poster child for becoming homeless, Mr. Most Likely to Succeed.    </segment8>
