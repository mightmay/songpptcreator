		<segment1>I know I've got it. anything you've got.</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm all or nothing. run from this prison we created.. in our lives. get me out.. It's just another. way into the cheaper way of life.. get in line. set me free.</segment2>
		<segment3>follow the trends of the needy. they'll make it easy on you.. I'm here with the worst of them. waiting. watching. for the time to strike.</segment3>
		<segment4>all you sinners. come out. come clean.. all you sinners. stop hiding behind the shadows.</segment4>
		<segment5>oh, it's nothing. don't blink. don't blink.. oh, stranger. stop hiding behind the shadows.. oh, it's nothing. don't blink. don't blink.. oh, stranger. crawl out from beneath your rock.</segment5>
		<segment6>I see it now. and I see it clearer than before.. and you can't stop me. you can't stop me.</segment6>
		<segment7>bring me back to the things that we loved so much. (outlined). break me back down so I can see it from the inside (fallen)</segment7>
		<segment8>oh, it's nothing. don't blink. don't blink.. oh, stranger. stop hiding behind the shadows.</segment8>
		<segment9>oh, it's nothing. don't blink. don't blink.. oh, stranger..</segment9>
		<segment10>I know I've got it. anything you've got.. you know I've got it.. tell me what you need. I'll bring it down     </segment10>
