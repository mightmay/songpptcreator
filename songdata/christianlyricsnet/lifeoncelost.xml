		<segment1>Life lived for myself. Mistakes send me to the ground. Living in constant sin. I'm alone, no one is around. Fight for my sanity, this world has taken toll. Fallen down on my knees, where is my control?. With no where else to turn, I looked to what I denied. Could I have been wrong, to whom does my life belong. Face down, I'm broken Lord, I move towards my life of reward. Life once lost, use it now, life once lost, but now I'm found. Life once lost.    </segment1>
