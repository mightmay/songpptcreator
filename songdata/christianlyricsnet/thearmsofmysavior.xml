		<segment1>When Im all alone. And the weight of the world. Is more than I can bear on my own. When all my plans have failed. And I suffered defeat. Im down on my knees. I cant get to my feet</segment1>
		<segment2>Your love breaks through. And reminds me of the hope that I have in You. That I have in You</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Theres no other place. That Id rather be. Than safe in the arms. The arms of my Savior. Theres no other place. Where I can be free. So I run to the arms. The arms of my Savior</segment3>
		<segment4>When Im feeling overwhelmed. Like I cant take anymore. Ive thrown up my hands. All I see is the floor. Ive looked to the north. The south, the west, and the east. But as far as I can see. I cant find any peace</segment4>
		<segment5>Your grace breaks through. And reminds me of the hope that I have in You. That I have in You</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Life shouldnt be something to dread. Cause I know You still know. How many hairs are in my head. And so I run to You. And so I run to You.     </segment7>
