		<segment1>Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that holla if you got that. Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that well holla back if you got that [2X]</segment1>
		<segment2>Do you got what I got. Cuz what I got is the reason I changed up a lot. And I don't wanna walk how I used to walk. And I don't wanna talk how I used to talk. Anyplace that you're at or anywhere you are. If you need this it really aint very far. You cant see it dwells all up in my heart. But you'll need this in case ya life fell apart. Jesus the one my hope is set upon. The secret to how I keep trekking on. He's the reason I'm no longer heading wrong. Cause he's leading on the path im getting on. I'm believing when things going wrong. He will be the rock that I get up on. Cuz I've seen it in everything I'm telling on. Do you need this here's what I'm telling y'all</segment2>
		<segment3>Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that holla if you got that. Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that well holla back if you got that [2X]</segment3>
		<segment4>Do you got that so what it be. Do you got the hope plus the peace. That everywhere you go It'll never leave. Well if so then let it show where I can see. But if not man I got the remedy. To every problem that could ever be. Cause he can solve em but do you see. Well open your heart it'll set you free. What I drop man I hope your getting me. Cuz in your top ten he cant be number 3. You gotta stop then and just let him lead. Let him hop in and give him the key. Well listen up dukes if you're hearing me. Cause what I just said is more than you'll ever need. And what he just gives is more than you'll ever see. Trying to do it on your own so I'm a speak saying. </segment4>
		<segment5>Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that holla if you got that. Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that well holla back if you got that [2X]</segment5>
		<segment6>So what you do when things get hot. What you think you got when everything stopped. What you think you'll drop when the things pop. And all fall apart and everything blocked. We go thru things non-stop. They want to hold us down leave us bound and just locked. But thing that I found and I just taught. You aint gotta bow down to no thing except God. You see he holds up my heart. And I can go far cuz he holds up my arms. And he keeps me calm plus he keeps me on. The path that walk and that I need to be on. Now you need to be warned. You can only make it all up in your life by yourself so long. Without Christ cuz his life was born. And he gave it and came back so check the song saying.</segment6>
		<segment7>Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that holla if you got that. Do you got that do you got that. Do you got that well holla back if you got that [2X].     </segment7>
