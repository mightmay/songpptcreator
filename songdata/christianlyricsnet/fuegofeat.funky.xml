eh yo I turned off the tv it sounds so lame. cause when they speak it all sounds so same. they say hope and that they got change. but it goes over my head like rogaine. I dont care if Im just no name. I wanna burn like a slow flame of propane. these things of the world is no gain. Ill take Jesus keep the rope chain. the whole thing is a such a paradigm. that keeps me on my knees just in my prayer time. its a mess man the whole nine. just in recession like Donald trumps hairline. so Im back on my grind. stepped off the mic to give him the airtime. but Im fine when I keep a clear mind. and stay up above it all just like the airlines</segment1>
		<segment2>weve gathered to come back at it. come on the track just to take a stab at it. hell take a life thats breaking down shattered. and do much more than break ya bad habits. so what I got is the grace now added. and I fiend for the Rock just like a crack addict. whether or not you think that mattered. Im ready to be used like Go Go gadget
