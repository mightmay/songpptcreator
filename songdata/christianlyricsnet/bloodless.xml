		<segment1>take me (far from all that's wrong). let these (fears collapse inside). take me (back to when I). believed</segment1>
		<segment2>and as a little boy they tried to hide his eyes. with reeds and rituals. the paper and the knife. but fire will always burn through skin and forgery. and answer when you won't. the bloodless hands of fear</segment2>
		<segment3>he didn't know he was hungry</segment3>
		<segment4>someone had a knife and took away my eyes</segment4>
		<segment5>the last time is right know. this choice will take or make everything. your face is fading out</segment5>
		<segment6>wash those days from your eyes. and let them fall away. drown the fear that own</segment6>
		<segment7>he felt the wake of torrid days. ushered through by warm mistakes. suddenly his broken feet. took their rest on bended knee</segment7>
		<segment8>the last time is right know. this choice will take or make everything. your face is fading out</segment8>
		<segment9>i won't stand here. this dance won't stop the music. your promise will help me lead untill the end</segment9>
		<segment10>what words have you to say (if this is the last time I won't forget you). before we spill (exhale the last breath, tear down the statues). this blood (this scar will remain here to mark where we severed). this time you will be afraid (my life from your hands). you have lost me. your plan failed (your hands from my heart)</segment10>
		<segment11>this is the last time    </segment11>
