		<segment1>Where do I begin?. There's so much I want to say to make it easier. Tomorrow's on it's way. Do you believe I want to take your painful memories?. I know you want to run away. I know that you can't see tomorrow</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Caroline, let me wipe away your tears and give you life, Make you feel beautiful again. Caroline, don't throw it all away. I'm here tonight to take away your pain.</segment2>
		<segment3>Yesterday is gone and everything that made you cry has fallen to the ground. I'm here to bring you home, I will always take you back. You haven't let me down. I know you want to run away. I know that you can't see tomorrow</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>And when you're feeling al alone and you can't go on, Remember I am here. And when you think you've gone too far, Ill meet you where you are. My arms are open wide    </segment5>
