		<segment1>A child is born tonight in Bethlehem. His mother holds him close and sings a sweet lullaby. All the world is sleeping unaware that God himself has come in the night</segment1>
		<segment2>The shepherds tremble as the angels sing. And in their song the voice of God speaks peace to the world. A miracle has happened, God has come and God has spoken. But the miracle has only just begun</segment2>
		<segment3>And the God who spoke is speaking still. And the God who came still comes. And the miracle that happened still happens in the heart that will believe. And we see (receive) the miracle of Christmas</segment3>
		<segment4>So come to Bethlehem again and see. The One who's come to rescue us, our Saviour and King. Bring your past, the joy, the sorrow, all your hope to find tomorrow</segment4>
		<segment5>And hear the words again, fear not and know that God is near</segment5>
		<segment6>For the God who spoke is speaking still. And the God who came still comes. And the miracle that happened still happens in the heart that will believe. And receive the miracle of Christmas</segment6>
		<segment7>Believe the miracle of Christmas. Will you believe?.     </segment7>
