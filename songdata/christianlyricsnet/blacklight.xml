		<segment1>Rape your mind till you're spiritually blind. Cults twist the truth into clever lies. Deceiving even God's holy elite. The god they serve will bring their defeat. When black becomes white and white becomes black, you can read the Word but still deny that Christ came down in the form of flesh, God incarnate to taste a bitter death. Chorus: Black Light, Blind Sight, Black Light, Hindsight, Black Light. His Word is clear, 1 Corinthians 15, if Christ did not rise your faith is in vain. He rose from the grave to give us new life but they reject Him and bask in black light. (Chorus). Rape your mind till you're spiritually blind. Cults twist the truth into clever lies. Deceiving even God's holy elite. The god they serve will bring their defeat. The god of this world has blinded their eyes. Satan comes as an angel of light. Teaching lies to itching ears. Doctrines of death are all that they hear. (Chorus). (Isaiah 7:14, Matthew 1:23, John 1:1&amp;14, 1 Corinthians 15, 2 Corinthians 4:4, Hebrews 2:9, Jude 3)    </segment1>
