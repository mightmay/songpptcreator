		<segment1>The moon's waving the world good-bye. The morning sun smiles and lights the sky. I hear the waves crashing into shore. The world's an ocean waiting at my door. Before I set out for the open sea. I'll take the Word my Father's given me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. And I'll go sailing out to treasure island. The treasure island that God's Word can be. I'll pray and make my way to treasure island. And in those quiet times, I know that I will find. All the treasure I will ever need</segment2>
		<segment3>I raise the sail as I kneel to pray. Check my course all along the way. A million thoughts like the rushing wind. Are blowing this ship, so I pray again. Soon I have landed on the solid ground. I'll take my life's concerns and lay them all down</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>And when I return to the mainland, I'll take the treasure back with me..</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus II. And I'll go sailing out to treasure island. The treasure island that God's Word can be. I'll pray and make my way to treasure island. And when the new day starts, I'll take my longing heart. And sail to treasure island once again </segment6>
