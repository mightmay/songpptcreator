		<segment1>I wrote a four word letter: Though Id lived I hadn't been alive.. You held my hem but I traveled blind, Thought Id sold my soul for something better. The rain came down, it wet my eyes;. I didn't mind, Its not me that you've missed. You heard me when I cried, &quot;Youve seen you've loved a side of me that died.&quot;. I remember sunshine, And you were mine, Its still a little cloudy but there's no rain in sight, You were mine.    </segment1>
