		<segment1>Yeah!. I could have dwelt in the silence of death. Had it not been for the Lord's help, When I said that my foot was slipping. His love supported me, When anxiety was great within me.</segment1>
		<segment2>His consolation brought joy to my soul. But it was His love which make my life whole.</segment2>
		<segment3>Go!</segment3>
		<segment4>Expectations blow in the wind. You could have stopped, but now you've sinned. Remember to repent you won't regret it. He died for you, don't forget it. Life is short, Christ's love, forever. Christians perfect? I say never. We aren't perfect, just forgiven. Can't you see that He's so clever.</segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah!    </segment5>
