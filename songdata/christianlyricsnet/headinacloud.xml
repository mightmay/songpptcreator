		<segment1>Maybe your view of quality is more than you can be. You bear your ideology so stoically. That all that you can see, is inferiority. Here I am, my head in a cloud. Can't you see my feet dangling, down there on the ground?. I guess I'm fool, cause I thought I could recognize. The people who cared for me, I thought I could draw the line. That surrounded my friends</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh I, I'm not going to give up</segment2>
		<segment3>And I don't mind the quitters, so much as the thieves. It's tolerable company, given the means. I won't waste my time crying. If I'm the last to understand. The difference between us, be it preference or circumstance. I'm losing the faith that youth hold in longevity. I guess that's the price for bartering naivety. Preferring the comfort that the skeptic takes in disbelief</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm not going to give    </segment4>
