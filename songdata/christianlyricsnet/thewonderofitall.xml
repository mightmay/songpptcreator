		<segment1>Looking out the window at the clouds flying by. I wonder if You moved them with a thought. or with a breath. And as they pass, I see the beauty of the sky. and wonder how You decided to make it that blue. And once again I'm amazed</segment1>
		<segment2>I see the miracle of a baby being born. And wonder how You gave us life. I see this young boy trying to grow into a man. And wonder how You let us live so long. And once again I'm amazed</segment2>
		<segment3>I can see the majesty You have made. I gaze into the eyes of Your creatures. I can feel the wind You breath on my face. And I'm amazed at the wonder of it all</segment3>
		<segment4>When beauty breaks forth from the shell of a worm. I wonder how You give it wings. When green leaves burst into the colors of a flame. I wonder why October is time for the display. And once again I'm amazed</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm amazed, speechless, stand in awe, astounded. Can't believe, Jesus what You've done for me    </segment5>
