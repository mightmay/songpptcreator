		<segment1>The Lord is my light and my salvation;. whom shall I fear?. The Lord is the strength of my life;. of whom shall I be afraid?. when the wicked, even mine enimies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear;. though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.    </segment1>
