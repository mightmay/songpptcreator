		<segment1>This is the last time I'll try to reach you. and my guess is, you'll just ignore it, just ignore me. Without a passing glance. without the slightest sigh. without moving your hands. without the softest cry. </segment1>
		<segment2>If I'd say. go your own way, I'll be with you. make mistakes and I'll forgive you. home is waiting here for you when you return. </segment2>
		<segment3>Rain reveals the foundation. and this one's wearing thin. and shifting in the sand. </segment3>
		<segment4>And the water does its damage. with its endless beating pulse. heralding the end </segment4>
		<segment5>Without a passing glance. without the slightest sigh. wihtout moving your hands. without the softest cry </segment5>
		<segment6>If Id say. go your own way, I'll be with you. make mistakes and I'll forgive you. home is waiting here for you when you return </segment6>
		<segment7>This is the last time I will try to reach you. and my guess is that you'll just ignore it, just ignore me. </segment7>
		<segment8>Go your own way, I'll be with you. make mistakes and I'll forgive you. home is waiting here for you when you return.     </segment8>
