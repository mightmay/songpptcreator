		<segment1>You said &quot;Come to me, if you're weak&quot;. &quot;I won't look away &amp; I will keep you close&quot;. But the closer I get the harder it seems. I find myself pulling away from all of the things I believe</segment1>
		<segment2>Chours: Lord, don't give up on me, it's You I need. So let your love rain down upon my soul. Filling up the deepest hole. I still love You so. I have tried to cross this river wide</segment2>
		<segment3>And even though the storms were raging high. I could see Your light shining constantly. (I could see morning light shining constantly). Constantly, You were always there</segment3>
		<segment4>You said &quot;Lay it down. give it up&quot;. &quot;I will understand no matter what it is&quot;. But instead I face failures &amp; constant disbelief. That you could ever love me knowing the secrets I keep</segment4>
		<segment5>Despite my broken heart &amp; shattered dreams. Lord, Your right there reminding me, reminding me</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, I have called to You in time of need. You let Your love rain down upon my soul. Constantly You let me know, I still love You so. Oh, I have tried to cross this river wide. And even though the storms were raging high. I could see the morning light, shining in the sunrise. Constantly    </segment6>
