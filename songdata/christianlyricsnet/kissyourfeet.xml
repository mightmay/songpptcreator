		<segment1>All I have in this world. Is more than a king could ever wish for. All these crowns leave me cold. For I was born to kiss Your feet</segment1>
		<segment2>All I have in this life. Is all for a King, you know I live for. And Your crown bears my name. For I was born to give You praise</segment2>
		<segment3>Isn't He beautiful. Isn't He beautiful. Isn't He beautiful</segment3>
		<segment4>Take this life, take it all. I'm breathing the dirt, but I have clean hands. So I'll run with my boots on. For I was born to give You fame    </segment4>
