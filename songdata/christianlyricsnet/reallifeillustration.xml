		<segment1>From the dawning of my infancy, you were always watching over me. Realization of a vacant heart, searching, come to find out you were worlds apart. I fear the time, when my mind? confused by my example. A portrait of, to show you love, greater hopes and promises for you. In these years gone past, I've come to be, more aware of opportunities. Every now and then deferring right, hoping, you don? see the conflicts in my life.    </segment1>
