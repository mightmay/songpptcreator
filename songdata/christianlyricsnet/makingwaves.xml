		<segment1>I will never sleep again the way that I have now. I will never close my eyes. It has taken me this long to get this far. It has taken me so long to get this far. Now I'm breaking through, Making waves and smashing against the shoreline. Breaking through, making waves and smashing against the shoreline. Now I'm staying on track this time. Forward motion is good. Free from guilt, over it all. This is my commitment. I'll live and let redemption see me through. What a world wants to hold me down. I'm standing firm. It feels so good..    </segment1>
