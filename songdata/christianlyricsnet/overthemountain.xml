		<segment1>Over the mountain, take me across the sky. Something in my vision, something deep inside. Where did I wander, where d'ya think I wandered to. I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through</segment1>
		<segment2>I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now. I told them I had ridden shooting stars. And said I'd show them how</segment2>
		<segment3>Over and over, always tried to get away. Living in a daydream, only place I had to stay. Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide. People around me talking to the walls inside</segment3>
		<segment4>I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now. I told them I had ridden shooting stars. And said I'd show them how</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me. You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free, yeah</segment5>
		<segment6>Over and under, in between the ups and downs. Mind on a carpet, magic ride goes 'round and round. Over the mountain, kissing silver inlaid clouds. Watching my body disappear into the crowd</segment6>
		<segment7>Don't need no astrology, it's inside of you and me. You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free, yeah    </segment7>
