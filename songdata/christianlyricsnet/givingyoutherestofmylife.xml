		<segment1>Im not a wealthy man. what i hold on to has no. worldly value. people dont understand. no way to measure the things. i treasure. cant put a price on somebodys love. oh Lord, theres nothin that im . giving up when im. . CHORUS: giving You the rest of my life. its no sacrifice  as long as i shall live ill be. giving You the rest of my life. with all that i have. no idle promises, im giving You the rest of my life. . i wanna pay You back. with something precious, this is. what my wish is. theres just one thing i have. thats mine to give You, its Yours to keep forever. whatever time on this earth. ive got left. whatever happens, for the worst. or best im. . chorus. . dont know what the future. holds for me. theres no way to see. but if i just hold on to Your love. ive got it all, what else do i need. . chorus    </segment1>
