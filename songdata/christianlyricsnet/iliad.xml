		<segment1>Iliad, tragedy, miseries all subtracted. A chosen one, I'm a father's son. I'm the one You attracted Chorus. For this lame world. Where the blame grows. You died upon it to redeem it. I believe it, I receive it. So forever You'll inhabit me</segment1>
		<segment2>You wouldn't walk out on this tragedy. Never give up on Your Iliad. You suffered for the victory. 'Cause it's always been Your labor of love</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>When the story of love began. From the starting until the end. The hero wins. Come tomorrow no one knows. But when everything unfolds. The hero wins. For this lame world. Where the blame grows. You died upon it to redeem it</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus    </segment5>
