		<segment1>Walked home tonight through the streets. Where we all came of age. Buildings still the same but the faces. Now seem so strange. Though its been so many years. Since I saw your face. I still think about you all the time. But you left no trace</segment1>
		<segment2>Where are you now?. Do you have somebody to love you?. Where are you now?. Could it be that you're thinking about me too</segment2>
		<segment3>I'd give anything to see you again. I'd give anything to see you again. No-one else. Could come close. To your Memory. I'd give anything to see you again </segment3>
		<segment4>Do you still believe in the Faith. That burned inside of us. Is your soul like a stone like our friends. Eroded to dust. Though it's been so many years. Since I heard your voice. One question still remains. Did you make the choice?</segment4>
		<segment5>This town has watched us rise and fall. To famine and to fame. Won't gain the World to lose my soul. Could you still say the same?    </segment5>
