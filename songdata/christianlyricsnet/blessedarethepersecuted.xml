		<segment1>We feel your hate, actions speak louder than words. You hate us, you try to silence us with your lies. It will take much more if you think you can shut us down. Your efforts are worthless against us. We will always stand our ground. Blessed are the persecuted, for the evils said against them. They will inherit the kingdom of God. Blessed are the persecuted. You are our God, to you we lift our hands. Persecuted for Your word, never bow to any man. Though evils lie before us, we maintain our stand. A lamp upon our feet and a light unto our path.    </segment1>
