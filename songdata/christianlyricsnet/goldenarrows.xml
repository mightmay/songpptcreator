		<segment1>So.. There it was behind the palms. Do you remember? It was what you dreamed that it would be. I had to turn the key. Cause I saw the scripted sleeves, I could have stayed but. Oh my goddess!. Oh my goddess I have left here. I said, who's in the walls?. I have to know her. Blooming from the corner_. Revolving. I asked, is there a war?. They watched me breathe dust. Calling out to free us. Weakened at the knees. Drawn bows that track the languorous. They were in panic. With plans for the newest planet's fate. But I had to move an inch. And that's when they caught a glimpse. I thought I could dash. Oh my goddess, I have left here. I said, who's in the walls?. I have to know her. Blooming from the corner. Revolving. I asked, is there a war?. They watched me breathe dust. Calling out to free us. Weakened at the knees. I saw beyond. What lips can't form. From stairs that climbed. Where beauty hides..    </segment1>
