		<segment1>every thought a thought of you. no more thought i ought to do. when everything we see or touch. we trust i true. every thought a thought of you</segment1>
		<segment2>every look in search of you. no need for book. i'm aware with you. wear a thin disguise. a light within my brother's eyes. every look in search of you</segment2>
		<segment3>da da da da da. da da da da</segment3>
		<segment4>every song in praise of you. our darkest nights are days to you. the trees raise branches high. like arms in church to grateful sky. every song in praise of you</segment4>
		<segment5>no one here to believe but you. everyone else is bound. to leave but you. and they swear their love is real. they mean, i like the way you make me feel. (no one here to believe but you). there is no one here to believe but you</segment5>
		<segment6>da da da da da. da da da da. da da da da da. da da da da    </segment6>
