		<segment1>So little of what seems to be. Is ever really there. So much of what's here I resent. I am a demagogue. Born of eternal flaw. Forever just a memory my friend. So when I disappear. She will still be here. Sifting my remains through the ashes</segment1>
		<segment2>She's not ordinary. She's just like me</segment2>
		<segment3>But there is something wrong. Inside of me that says. That she and I are one in the same. So I'm not alone. She's just like me    </segment3>
