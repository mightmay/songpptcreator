		<segment1>People everywhere have something to say. From the East to the West. From here to Bombay. Save the whales save the planet. Save the eagles today. From the mountains to the valleys. To the rich and the poor. Everybody has a voice but they still want more. They fight they shout they yell. What they screamin for. Picket lines burning flags magazines. Coup-de-ta, kill the king. See the popel rally hear them scream. The worlds a speaker listen to them sing </segment1>
		<segment2>It's an Audio World. A world thats reaching out to you. It's an Audio World. A world thats dying to hear the truth </segment2>
		<segment3>You got to show up speak up get the Word told. Tell all the people nad you've got to be bold. Just let the voice of God in their hearts unfold. We make the message known by the anthems we sing. But there's many of us who haven't done a thing. Be a sign waver for the Christ and the coming King. Let's preach and teach and spread the Word. Tell everybody 'til everybody's heard. Let it be known that it's for the King. And this is the reason that we sing     </segment3>
