		<segment1>A day is coming. When all will be fed. There wont be a single hungry mouth. Begging for bread. A day is coming. When every disease. Will be swept away. As mercy floods through every street. A day is coming. A day is coming. A day is coming. But until that day comes</segment1>
		<segment2>Let Your kingdom come in me. Let Your will be done in me. Here on earth as it is and as it will be in heaven. Show Your glory to the world. Tell Your story to the world. Let my life be a preview of coming attractions. Yeah, coming attractions</segment2>
		<segment3>A day is coming. That wont fade to night. Therell be no more hatred to endure. No wars to fight. Therell be no orphans. No prisoners or slaves. And all the tears of death and pain. Will be washed away. This day is coming. Its surly coming. Jesus youre coming. But until that day comes</segment3>
		<segment4>Let Your kingdom come in me. Let Your will be done in me. Here on earth as it is and as it will be in heaven. Show Your glory to the world. Tell Your story to the world. Let my life be a preview of coming attractions. Yeah, coming attractions</segment4>
		<segment5>Shine Your light through me. Live Your life through me. Let the world see Your kingdom come in me. Shine Your light through me. Live Your life through me. Let the world see Your kingdom come in me</segment5>
		<segment6>Let Your kingdom come in me. Let Your will be done in me. Here on earth as it is and as it will be in heaven. Show Your glory to the world. Tell Your story to the world. Let my life be a preview of coming attractions. Yeah, coming attractions </segment6>
