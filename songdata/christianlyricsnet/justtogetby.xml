		<segment1>Listen up here's another lesson. Chapter 2 of this saga. Sparks yet another question. Are you doing just enough to get by. To try and fool 'em into thinking. That you live the right life. Or maybe thinking since you can't see Him. He can't see you. That's understandable 'cause. Then I used to feel it too. But we're responsible for every action. And like Newton there's an equal reaction</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>You're afraid of what it takes to give it all away. Doing enough just to get by, just to get by. Thinking that you live the right life.  . It's so ridiculous to think you all just hearin' us. If you believe it let it known y'all be feelin' us. Not just the sound but the Trinity in whom we trust. It's already known who in the end will be victorious. And like KJ it's a 12-round knockout. I'll fight to the end and I'll be the one to walk out. Step out holdin' up the crown like a title belt. It's one bout the devil wish he never dealt</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>It's all mixed up in your head about. What's wrong and what is right</segment5>
		<segment6>What's right    </segment6>
