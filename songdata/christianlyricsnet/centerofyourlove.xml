		<segment1>Tell me have you ever been. On the outside looking in. Well it's a cold and lonely place. Out from under heaven's grace</segment1>
		<segment2>Did you ever wonder why. Or did it ever make you cry. Tears of joy when you found out. What his love is all about</segment2>
		<segment3>It's the water tha ti need. It's the air that my heart breathes. And I have come to realize. Love is keeping me alive</segment3>
		<segment4>In the shelter of your arms I've found. The center of your love is where I'm free</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: And I just want to be in the center of your love. Yeah that's all I'm thinking of. Whoa I just want to know. How your love is with me everywhere. Your love is with me everywhere I go. (everywhere I go)</segment5>
		<segment6>There is nothing I can see. That the world can offer me. What could possible compare. To your tender, loving care</segment6>
		<segment7>You're the only one I've found. Who can make my world go 'round. 'cause it's only at your side. Where there's meaning in my life</segment7>
		<segment8>All that's in this world has let me down. But you are all that matters to me</segment8>
		<segment9>Repeat chorus</segment9>
		<segment10>Int he shelter of your arms I've found. The center of your love is where I'm free</segment10>
		<segment11>Repeat chorus</segment11>
		<segment12>Chorus: I jsut want to be in the center of your love. Yeah that's all I'm dreamingof. Whoa I just want to know. How your love is with me everywhere. Your love is with me everywhere I go. (everywhere I go)    </segment12>
