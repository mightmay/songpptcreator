		<segment1>How can i smile while vampires sing?. I must confess that sometimes i live up in a tree. Blessed by a ghost with an open arm and a steady hand for redemption. I forget that winter comes with a Deadline, and then she's gone. Cold air cage opened up. resurrected: Dark angels. And the conversation gets placed once again, underneath my brain and up in front of my mouth. Technology, Well, she takes a walk and she is so proud. The catalysts include a microphone and a highway of wires. Misused and taken for granted. How i can i smile while vampires sing?. Blessed by a ghost with an open arm and a steady hand for redemption</segment1>
