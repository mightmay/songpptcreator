		<segment1>On a bus ride into town, I wondered &quot;Why am I going to town?&quot;. I looked around at th e billboards and the stores I thought, &quot;Why do I look around?&quot;. so I got out and I bowed and kissed the filthy ground. and in the first dry spot I found I laid down without having to wonder why I was laying down. Before long I was too cold and so took a bus back to the station. I found a letter left by a pay phone with no return contact information, it was addressed: To total strangers, it read like a horn blown by some sad angel. &quot;Bunny, it was me who let you down&quot;. it was the shyest attempt I'd ever seen at conversation. if I didn't have You as my guide I'd still wander lost in Sinai. counting the plates of cars from out-of-state, (how I could jump in their path they hurry along!). until you could surround me, you're pretty but you're all I can see, like a thick fog - if there was no way into God, I would never have laid in this grave of a body for so long, St. Cyril's fair always came through the first week of September. but it's already the 19th and there's no sign of it yet. I have a hard time remembering the things I should remember. and a hard time forgetting the things I should forget. Oh Christ when You're ready to come back I think I'm ready for You to come back. but if You want to stay wherever exactly it is You are, that's okay too - it's really none of my business. If I didn't have You as my guide I'd still be wandering lost in Sinai. or down by the tracks watching trains go by to remind me: There are places that aren't here. I had a well but all the water left so I'll ask Your forgiveness with every breath, if there was no way into God, I would never have laid in this grave of a body. So long, dear.    </segment1>
