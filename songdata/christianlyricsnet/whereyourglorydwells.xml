		<segment1>Holy one, we come in Your honor. Show Your blessing and favor upon us. Our hearts are heavy and spirits are tired. But in Your glory well walk through the fire. </segment1>
		<segment2>Bring to our lives a sense of your calling. Hear our cries to be completely healed. In Your eyes well discover the meaning of your unending grace. Were desperate for a taste. Were longing for the place where Your glory dwells.</segment2>
		<segment3>Precious one, we bow in Your presence. Hands outstretched in a holy expectance. Desperately pleading for restoration to empty hearts.  And a broken nation    </segment3>
