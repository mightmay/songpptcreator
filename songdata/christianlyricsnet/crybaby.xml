		<segment1>Well cry like a baby. &quot;C&quot; moon, &quot;C&quot; moon. So where do you go?. Up high, under low. The devil I know said. &quot;Something is missing&quot;. Outside it's hot, the first of July. And the look in your eye said. &quot;Something is missing&quot;. Midnight she cried like a baby. &quot;C&quot; moon, &quot;C&quot; moon, &quot;C&quot; moon. Cried like a baby. Can this be something. We can't understand?. Could it be the girl. Can't understand?. Where will we go?. Up high, under low. The devil I know said. &quot;Something is missing&quot;. Sweet little angels sing. 'Bout the fast pace of things. But earth children sing. &quot;Love will conquer anything&quot;. Midnight she cried like a baby. &quot;C&quot; moon, &quot;C&quot; moon, &quot;C&quot; moon. Cried like a baby. Could it be. We can't understand?. Can it be that we can't. Cry, cry, cry, cry like a. Midnight, cry like a. Whisper, scream like a baby. Cry, cry like a baby. Could this be. Something we can't understand?. Cry like a baby, cry like a baby. Could this something that we. Can't understand, understand?. Well cry like a baby. &quot;C&quot; moon, &quot;C&quot; moon    </segment1>
