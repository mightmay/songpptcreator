		<segment1>When I speak. May it bend, break, and bleed sincerity. When I speak. May it bend, break, and bleed sincerity. A voice. A voice like running waters. Its not dry nor is it hollow. That is a river you want to follow. There are those who debase His word. Look the part but its too absurd. Diminish His word. Look the part but its too absurd, too absurd. Im not telling you, Im not telling you to meet any conditions. But to question everything! Everything has its time! Everything has its season. Its purpose, timing, its reason. My length of years put into perspective (determines). Nows the time! To question everything! Everything has its time! Not trying to shove anything down anyones throats. Forgive me for judging the breath of life and the breath we breathe. Not trying to shove anything down anyones throats. Forgive me for judging the breath of life and the breath we breathe. When I speak. May it bend, break, and bleed sincerity. When I speak. May it bend, break, and bleed sincerity. A voice like running waters. Its not dry nor is it hollow. That is a river you want to follow. Want to follow. Question everything! Question everything! Question everything! Everything!    </segment1>
