		<segment1>You want to swim in the river, I want to dance in the summer. You've always been the believer, I'm always left to wonder. The water's rushing so fast, I think it will take us under.</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, what thought did you recall, that would make you say my name?. The water's too deep , our friends say, &quot;Don't go.&quot;. But my mouth betrays me and says, &quot;Hold on!&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>And now I know, this is the pain of believing. The danger is real, and there is no easy way out. How did I get here?. You trust too much in my bravery. It's my safety you are taking.</segment3>
		<segment4>We are going to drown in the river. I cannot swim any farther. My blood is pumping so fast to my heart and limbs underwater.</segment4>
		<segment5>But I reach and find your hands in mine. And I say, &quot;You will be saved!&quot;. I pull and I pull and I pull. But your foot is anchored deep. Your face tells me you won't be freed.</segment5>
		<segment6>I decided long ago never to let your loved ones know.. who you really are. People want the truth but never want the scars. And now I'm here with my best friend dying. And I'm the one that's still lying. And you say it's going to be okay. Over and over again.</segment6>
		<segment7>River, wash me clean.    </segment7>
