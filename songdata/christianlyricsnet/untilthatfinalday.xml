		<segment1>My flesh is tired of seeking god, But on my knees I'll stay. I want to be a pleasing child, Until that final day.</segment1>
		<segment2>My mind is full of many thoughts. That clutter and confuse. But standing firm, I will prevail, In faith that I'll be used.</segment2>
		<segment3>Amen! I'm asking once again. Won't you help me my friend, lord jesus. Holy lord spirit, set us free, From chains we cannot see, Come release us.</segment3>
		<segment4>I wrestle not with flesh and blood, My fight is with the one, Who lost the keys of hell and death, To god's most precious son.</segment4>
		<segment5>One sleepless night of anguished prayer, I triumphed over sin. One battle in the holy war, God's promised me to win.</segment5>
		<segment6>Amen! I'm asking once again. Won't you help me my friend, lord jesus. Holy, lord spirit, set us free, From chains we cannot see, Come release us.</segment6>
		<segment7>My flesh is tired of seeking god, But on my knees I'll stay. I want to be a pleasing child, Until that final day.    </segment7>
