		<segment1>I tried to run. I tried to fight You. But I'm done. I'm giving up. I've learned to trust You, Your love</segment1>
		<segment2>No I'm singing..</segment2>
		<segment3>Can You take over?. Take over. Can You take over me?. I've been here over and over again. Here on my knees. I'm only closer and closer. To where I wanna be. When You take over, take over. Can You take over me?</segment3>
		<segment4>I tried before. To let go. And I just hold on more. Amazing Lord. I need the strength to let go. And be Yours</segment4>
		<segment5>So now I'm singing..</segment5>
		<segment6>Can You take over?. Take over. Can You take over me?. I've been here over and over again. Here on my knees. I'm only closer and closer. To where I wanna be. When You take over, take over. Can You take over me?</segment6>
		<segment7>I surrender all I have. And I surrender all I am. As I remember what You've done to set me free</segment7>
		<segment8>I just want to sing..</segment8>
		<segment9>Can You take over?. Take over. Can You take over me?. I've been here over and over again. Here on my knees. I'm only closer and closer. To where I wanna be. When You take over, take over. Can You take over me?</segment9>
		<segment10>Can You take over?. Take over. Can You take over me?. I've been here over and over again. Here on my knees. I'm only closer and closer. To where I wanna be. When You take over, take over. Can You take over me?</segment10>
		<segment11>Take over me. Take over me     </segment11>
