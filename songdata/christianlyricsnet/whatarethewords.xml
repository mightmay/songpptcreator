		<segment1>What are the words?. What are they saying?. If I am still. I, too, can hear;. The skies are singing. The breezes whisper, &quot;Make friends with silence, Stop and draw near&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;Our God is true. Our lord is mighty. Glorious Jehovah. Is calling you. Now through the thunder. Now through the raining. Now through the laughter. Now through the pain</segment2>
		<segment3>Hallelujah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah</segment3>
		<segment4>What are the words?. What are they saying?. If I am still. I, too, can hear;. The skies are singing. The breezes whisper, &quot;Make friends with silence, Stop and draw near&quot;</segment4>
		<segment5>&quot;Our God is true. Our Lord is mighty. Glorious Jehovah. Is calling you. Now through the thunder. Now through the raining. Now through the laughter. Now through the pain.&quot;    </segment5>
