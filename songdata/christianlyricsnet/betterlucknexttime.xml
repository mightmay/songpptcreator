		<segment1>Sometimes we fall. Ain't nothing new to me. Don't care move on. I must say you gave up for this time now</segment1>
		<segment2>Stop tell me where you going. Maybe the one you love isn't there. You're going under. But you're over it all so you don't care about all that I had to see. Watch you wait until you come around. Around</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't close your eyes. You need to see it all. It's no surprise. That they break you down. Least they won't give you up</segment3>
		<segment4>Stop tell me where you going. Maybe the one you love isn't there. You're going under. But you're over it all so you don't care about all that I had to see. Watch you wait until you come around</segment4>
