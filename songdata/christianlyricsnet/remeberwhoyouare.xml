		<segment1>My daddy always told that his mamma always said. &quot;No matter what you become in this life, Whether big or small n the eyes of men. You'd remember who you are in the eyes of God&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>Remember who you are in Jesus. He sees you as his own it pleases Him to know that you. Remember who you are in Jesus. It's His name you wear. My child, remember who you are</segment2>
		<segment3>So I am giving you now. This legacy of love. The greatest gift that I can give you is to pray. That whether big or small. In the eyes of men, You'd remember who you are. In the eyes of God</segment3>
		<segment4>Remember who you are in Jesus. He sees you as his own it pleases Him to know that you. Remember who you are in Jesus. It's His name you wear. My child, remember who you are</segment4>
		<segment5>There is a song living deep within your soul. As life goes on that soul begins to grow. Until the day when the world will need to know. Who you are..Remember who you are    </segment5>
