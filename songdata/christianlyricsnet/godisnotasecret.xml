		<segment1>You don't understand. this is not what you think it is. You don't get it, man. you want to boil it down to show biz. Your in-depth research shows: drop the God, emphasize the beat. I've heard that positive pop you dig--. I'd rather be buried in wet concrete. Take back your free advice. I don't accept. I will not play those games. God is not a secret to be kept. God is not a secret to be kept </segment1>
		<segment2>You don't understand. I'm not talking multiple choice. You don't get it, man. if the cross offends you, find another voice. I am not running for office here. I won't keep it purposefully vague. I've heard New Age Life-force trip. I'd rather be dipped in bubonic plague </segment2>
		<segment3>Take back your free advice. I don't accept. I will not play those games. God is not a secret to be kept. God is not a secret to be kept </segment3>
		<segment4>If we keep silent. If we mass defect. These very rocks will scream. God is not a secret to be kept. God is not a secret to be kept </segment4>
		<segment5>And would I wash my hands again?. Would I deny my savior when. he hung inside the public square?. Did not my silence put him there?    </segment5>
