		<segment1>Judge not. less you be judged first. what you got. is gonna bring hurt. you know. so just keep it inside. keep it in your mind. and then you might find. the next time around. you need me about. you scream. you shout. K.O. in first round. What, what?. You think that I should. You think that I would. I don't think that I could</segment1>
		<segment2>You try to fight me try to light me on fire. But you cannot take away my desire. You try to school me try to fool me with cheep tricks. But I'll always recognise a liar</segment2>
		<segment3>What now?. Are you gonna keep lying. Take my advice. I'd rather see you crying. In time. You will feel what I feel now. I kneel down. But that don't mean. I'm not real now. See how. Everything I said is reality. Everything I made. became like theology. so knowledge me. as the one who won't bow down. now, now. I recognise you're the loud mouth</segment3>
		<segment4>And I know I will kneel. Before the One I will kneel. He made me be what I am today. And I know I will see his face    </segment4>
