		<segment1>All God's creatures got a place in the choir. Some sing low and some sing higher. Some just sing out like a bird on a wire. Waiting to fly home.</segment1>
		<segment2>All God's children are the apple of His eye. Even the ones we can't stand sometimes. But because you care just to go outside. And I need something to sing with this neighbour of mine</segment2>
		<segment3>That's why grace is so amazing. That's why love is so absurd. That's why I sing for a god unchanging. That's why I don't care if I look like a fool</segment3>
		<segment4>All God's people got a reason to live. Joy for the hard days and true love to give. So we raise our hands and lay down sin. And remember the days our freedom began</segment4>
		<segment5>That's why grace is so amazing. That's why love is so absurd. That's why I sing for a God unchanging. That's why I don't care if I look like a fool. His grace is so amazing. That's why love is so absurd. That's why I sing for a God unchanging. That's why I don't care if I look like a fool.</segment5>
		<segment6>Yeah I look like a fool</segment6>
		<segment7>Feeding the hungry. Clothing the naked. Giving the homeless a place to rest. Visiting the prisoner. Lifting up the lowly. By your fruits</segment7>
		<segment8>May you shine on us. May you shine on us. Shine on us. Oh shine on us</segment8>
		<segment9>That's why grace is so amazing. That's why love is so absurd. That's why I sing for a God unchanging. That's why I don't care if I look like a fool. His grace is so amazing. That's why love is so absurd. That's why I sing for a God unchanging. That's why I don't care if I look like a fool    </segment9>
