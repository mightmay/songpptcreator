		<segment1>This mathematic sunset starts a neck to sink her teeth into again. A late aesthetic exit is impossible but not from rafter sins</segment1>
		<segment2>I am just alive, she's just a fake. Now poison is running through the seams. The numbers say it, flash up the screen. And from crescendo cuts the knee</segment2>
		<segment3>Gravity will retrace every step. Gravity will retrace every step</segment3>
		<segment4>One cholera outbreak and the blinds are pulled, the shades are drawn here. Once again but to drop Murexa in lakes. In too much so drop the glass to shatter then it blends</segment4>
		<segment5>Gravity will retrace every step. Gravity will retrace every step    </segment5>
