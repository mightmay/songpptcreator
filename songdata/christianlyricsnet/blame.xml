		<segment1>Won't you come with me. To a place I like to hide. To a place where I can slumber. against the fall of this world. Who you gonna blame. Everywhere I go. Gotta find someone to give the abuse. Gotta pass off the blame, you gotta blame it on me. Now I see your shame. the shadows comfort you. your guilt stricken face it tells me. that you've been, just where I've been. Who you gonna blame?    </segment1>
