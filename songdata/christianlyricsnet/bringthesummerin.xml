		<segment1>Blue summer carpet tween the trees. No longer smothered by the leaves. You bring your sun to light the days. The summertime lightens my ways</segment1>
		<segment2>Though the rain is falling fast. The summer in your heart will last. Kicking darkness far away. Lighting up the darkest day</segment2>
		<segment3>Though the discontented, Misconnected winters come and go. Still you shine as mine. No UV warning needed for this show</segment3>
		<segment4>So come on now. Let's bring the summer in. Though days are cloudy. Come on now. Let's bring the summer in. Let's change the season. For one reason. Bring the summer in</segment4>
		<segment5>No sweat marks lurking underneath. No fast acting anti histamines. No need to fear the outside burn. Just be prepared for inside turn</segment5>
		<segment6>Sky forms the feeling day by day. But you can choose to push away. Any winter of your heart. Bring in summer at the start</segment6>
		<segment7>So as you plan your steps along. This weather front stays ever strong. No need to pack your water proofs. Just get the sunnys, drop the roof</segment7>
		<segment8>Live in summertime today. Its burning in you day by day. Every season of your soul. The summers there at your control    </segment8>
