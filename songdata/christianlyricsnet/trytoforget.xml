		<segment1>how can i do it?. when i know it's just not right. the pictures blind my sight. when we glorify. we glorify the flesh and we do it at any cost. no thoughts given to reason for how much we've lost. two seconds of pleasure for a lifetime of grief. no reconciliation. a future with no relief. i try to forget the weakness. i would never be swayed. now i live this nightmare that i've made. how could i have fallen?. turn it off. release me. hear my cries. forgive me    </segment1>
