		<segment1>I don't know if light is brighter. In the earth or the soul. I don't know which night is darker. The one I do or don't know</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. But I'm convinced. I'm persuaded. I will not be separated. From the love. I have in You. `Cause neither death or life can severe. Neither height or depth could measure the love You have. And my love for You</segment2>
