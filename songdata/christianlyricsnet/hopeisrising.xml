		<segment1>This is the time for the rising. When our souls stand as one. This is the time for redemption. When all we see you come. This is the time for healing. Where broken lives are made new. This is the time for revival When all will bow to you</segment1>
		<segment2>Every prison has a door. Every captive can be free. Every sinner has a hope. And hope is rising up in me</segment2>
		<segment3>This is the will of a Maker. To see his children made whole. This is the will of a Savior. To lead his children home. Holy spirit, send you power. Cause only you can save us now    </segment3>
