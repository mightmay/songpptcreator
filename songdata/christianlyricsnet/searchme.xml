		<segment1>Search me O God. Search me and find. Any way in me that does not reflect Your purity. Refine me O God. In the fire of Your gaze. That I might be holy in all of my ways. Take me deeper Lord. Draw me closer LordÂ… </segment1>
		<segment2>Give me a heart after Your own heart. Give me a mind that is pure and pleasing to You. Fill me with love. With Your power and Your joy. That this world might see You in me    </segment2>
