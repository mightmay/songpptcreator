		<segment1>We still live the same town, well don't we?. But I don't see you around anymore. I go to all the same places. Not even a trace of you. Your days are numbered at 24.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you. We're not getting any younger. And I won't look back 'cause there's no use. Its time to move forward.</segment2>
		<segment3>I feel no sympathy. You live inside a cave. You barely get by, the rest of us are trying. There's no need to apologize. I've got no time for feeling sorry.</segment3>
		<segment4>Well I try not to think of what might happen. When your reality it finally cuts through. Well as for me I got out and I'm on the road. The worst part is that this, this could be you.</segment4>
		<segment5>You know it too. You can't run from your shame. You're not getting any younger. Time keeps passing by. But you wave it away. Its time to roll over.</segment5>
		<segment6>I feel no sympathy. You live inside a cave. You barely get by, the rest of us are trying. There's no need to apologize. I've got no time for feeling sorry.</segment6>
		<segment7>And all the best lies. they are told with fingers tied. So cross 'em tight. Won't you promise me tonight. If its the last thing you do. you'll get out.</segment7>
		<segment8>I feel no sympathy. You live inside a cave. You barely get by, the rest of us are trying. There's no need to apologize. I've got no time for feeling sorry.</segment8>
		<segment9>I feel no sympathy. You live inside a cave. You barely get by, the rest of us are trying. There's no need to apologize. I've got no time. I've got no time for feeling sorry.     </segment9>
