		<segment1>Do you remember. The southern breakfast treat. Referred to as grits. But it looks like cream of wheat. (chorus). Don't bring me down. Please, please. Don't bring me down. (repeat chorus). (Check this). Yo, I know a secret. Too hard not to tell. (Don't bring me down). If grits was locked up. Gotee would post bail. (repeat chorus x2). Are you familiar. With the southern breakfast treat. (Don't bring me down). Referred to as breads. But to me it looks like. Spooky cream of wheat. (Chorus x3)     </segment1>
