		<segment1>So this is who I become. When You leave me to myself. A burned-up, hollow, angry, empty shell. An actor on a barren stage. An even-keel with unchanneled rage. Sinking deeper into hell </segment1>
		<segment2>Bind me to You. Pierce me straight through. Consume me with Your fire. Ravage my heart. Tear me clean apart. And still be my Desire </segment2>
		<segment3>As I descend it starts again </segment3>
		<segment4>Sliding down, spiraling. Gasping on the breath of corruption. Fighting undertow. Holding on, realizing. My own hopeless helplessness. Finally letting go </segment4>
		<segment5>All is madness as the flames engulf me. Oblivion. Refining fire making ashes of this life. Burn, Fire, burn. Clean this holy temple. Resore Your holy Name. In the onslaught of Your love </segment5>
		<segment6>And now, as gradual as the fall. The dawn of hope. The brilliant sun sending all the shadows fleeing. Sweet daylight. A new man rising from the ashes. Clothed in white, bearing a new name. I leave it all behind and take to flight     </segment6>
