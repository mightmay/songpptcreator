		<segment1>Look what I've done. This picture I've painted. It looks like my heart. Or what still remains </segment1>
		<segment2>Convinced of the weight. Your interpretations. Are not what I see. I wish they could be </segment2>
		<segment3>I remember it much redder. I remember it much brighter </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: Can you stay for a while. Try to imagine this. Could you be for a while. I can't remember it. Could you fall for a while. I can't escape from this </segment4>
		<segment5>I'll try to explain. The way that the frame. Doesn't quite fit the image. Or surround the edge </segment5>
		<segment6>It stands on display. What do you see?. Behold all the new grey. What's become of the old me </segment6>
		<segment7>I remember it much redder. I remember it much brighter </segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus] </segment8>
		<segment9>Calling, crying, ashamed of what I am not. Really failing, falling into this cage and I can't escape. I can't escape </segment9>
		<segment10>Look what I've done. This picture I've painted. Doesn't quite fit. Or surround the edge. I remember it much redder </segment10>
		<segment11>[Chorus] </segment11>
		<segment12>I can't escape, I can't escape, I can't escape     </segment12>
