		<segment1>I pull over to the side of the road and I. Watch the cars pass me be. The headlights and the black limousine tell me. Someone is saying goodbye. I bow my head and I whisper a prayer, Father, Comfort their broken hearts. And as I drive away theres a thought that I. I cannot escape, no I, cannot escape this thought. I cant get away</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, if this should be my last day on this earth. How then shall I live. Oh, if this should be the last day that I have. Before I breathe the air of heaven. Let me live it with abandon to. The only thing that remains. After my last day here on earth</segment2>
		<segment3>If this should be my last day here on earth. If this should be my last day here on earth. If this should be my last day here on earth. If this should be my last day here on earth</segment3>
		<segment4>And if tomorrows comes to find me. Looking in the face of Jesus. Will I hear Him say the words well done?</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, if this should be my last day on this earth. How then shall I live. Oh, if this should be the last day that I have. Before I breathe the air of heaven. Let me live it with abandon to. The only One that remains. After my last day here on earth</segment5>
		<segment6>If this should be my last day here on earth. If this should be my last, my last day here on earth. Cause this could be my last, this could be my last. This could be my last day </segment6>
