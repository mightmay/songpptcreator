		<segment1>We walked the line, and made it out on the other side. We were so blind, how can we see when we cant open our eyes?. (We walked the line) We walked the line, and made it out on the other side. We were so blind, how can we see when we cant open our eyes?</segment1>
		<segment2>Open your eyes. And see how dangerous it could be to see what weve consumed. Were living without a purpose, living without a compass. On a ship without a captain, well sink into the blackness. Of an ocean depth so deep we cant find light to help us see.</segment2>
		<segment3>Pour salt in my wound, stitch up my face. Will I make it out of this place?. Forget the past, stand eye to eye, show your scars, this is your fight.</segment3>
		<segment4>The wicked will fall. The wicked will cease to exist. Their cities will burn. Theyll crumble beneath their feet. (As wicked) As wicked well fall. As wicked well cease to exist. Our cities will burn. Theyll crumble beneath our feet.</segment4>
		<segment5>Were no better than anyone else. Were no better than anyone else, but we can change ourselves. Were no better than anyone else, so why do we pretend?. Were no better than anyone else, but we can change ourselves. Were no better than anyone else, so why do we pretend?</segment5>
		<segment6>So as you sit on your faulty throne, making promises you cannot keep. One day youll be overthrown, till then we will not sleep.. we will not sleep.</segment6>
		<segment7>We will tear apart this wasteland, in search of the truth. We will tear apart this wasteland, in search of the truth.    </segment7>
