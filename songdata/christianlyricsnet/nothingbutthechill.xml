		<segment1>You make me drunk like dad's whisky. When I was thirteen years old. Now I've got my nose pressed down on the table. Like I'm waiting for him to come home</segment1>
		<segment2>My thought's keep rolling like boulders. Sharp off the tip of my tongue. I know he'd say Son, you're a man, stop crying. But daddy I still feel so young</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold me, I will hold you back. Nothing but the chill will let you go</segment3>
		<segment4>Outside the rust just keeps building. Around the gate of my fence. Last time I checked it was you I was mending. And nothing else needed me since</segment4>
		<segment5>Over the streets in the city. Winter is bringing her chill. I hear her calling at the top of the chimney. But I'm not inviting her in</segment5>
		<segment6>Hold me, I will hold you back. Nothing but the chill will let you go. Love me, I will love you back. Nothing but the chill will let you go. There's no way I'm ever letting go    </segment6>
