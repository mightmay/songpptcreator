		<segment1>My will won't break, it barely bends. Same old sinner, the same old sin. On my knees to plead again. Confessions trial, where to begin?</segment1>
		<segment2>Have mercy, on me a sinning man. Lord have mercy, on me a sinning man</segment2>
		<segment3>If it's true that the wages of sin is death. Then I've earned quite enough to quit. The reward I deserve I'd surely get. Were it not for you to pay my debt</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, I don't think I can take this further. Oh, if it's not one thing it's another.     </segment4>
