		<segment1>Why do the nations rage?. Why do they plot and scheme?. Their bullets can't stop the prayers we pray. In the name of the Prince of Peace. We walk in faith and remember long ago. How they killed Him and then how on the third day He arose. Well, things may look bad. And things may look grim. But all these things must. pass except the things that are of Him</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Where are the nails that pierced His hands?. Well the nails have turned to rust. But behold the Man. He is risen. And He reigns. In the hearts of the children. Rising up in His name. Where are the thorns that drew His blood?. Well, the thorns have turned to dust. But not so the love. He has given. No, it remains. In the hearts of the children. Who will love while the nations rage</segment2>
		<segment3>The Lord in Heaven laughs. He knows what is to come. While all the chiefs of state. Plan their big attacks. Against His anointed One. The Church of God she will not bend her knees. To the gods of this world. Though they promise her peace. She stands her ground. Stands firm on the Rock. Watch their walls tumble down. When she lives out His love</segment3>
