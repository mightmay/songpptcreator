		<segment1>I see the vacancy in this once good vessel. The negativity (the blessing) caused your own downfall. Shut up and you will see He love's you, He loves me. Have you forgot what your fighting for. In this crying out, this act of acceptance. Your loosing what your were fighting for. Why don't you just shut up, but you keep on You &quot;don't even care&quot;, so what's the deal. You're a liar and you've accepted the lie. now you don't know why God's grace is gone from you. change your life before your through. I know: I have expirienced You vomit: your isqualifing as we speak: I used to be like you    </segment1>
