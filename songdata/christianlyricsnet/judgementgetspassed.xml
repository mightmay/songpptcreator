		<segment1>Well, you're born and you just got one chance. Use it now, 'cause you won't be back again. Well, we all die once  but what's after that?. Well, we all rise  the judgment gets passed and you can't come back. Well, now Hebrews 9:27 says that there's one time to die for every man. Wait around 'til your time's up and then you're dead.  Are you countin' on bein' reincarnated?.  Are you found in the Lamb's Book of Life, my friend?. Will you frown on the White Throne Judgment Day?.     </segment1>
