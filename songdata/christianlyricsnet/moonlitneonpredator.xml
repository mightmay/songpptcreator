		<segment1>So this is real, the window sill, it cannot heal. All the secrets are here now. All I've known, my cover's blown, the ages shown. You know that they all fake the hope. The neon lights, the fade of night, the fear of heights. The complex and effects start. Breaking tide to beach the white, and early light. And the water only from His side.</segment1>
		<segment2>All alone. There's whispers of defenses gone.</segment2>
		<segment3>This is the way, this is the motion. Let go now. This is the threat, this is the ocean. Let go now.</segment3>
		<segment4>And so it's made, the frozen shade has turned my gaze. This effect is in motion. Strength is gone, my breath is on the last is drawn. You know that it will soon be gone. Still I wait in today and complicate. And all time is just frozen. I see through, was never you, and what you said. The hope is where His hand has bled.</segment4>
		<segment5>Just let go.</segment5>
		<segment6>(Isaiah 6:9,10)    </segment6>
