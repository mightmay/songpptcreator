		<segment1>When all I have is on the floor. Divided, divided. When I'm a world away from peace. Behind Your eyes is where I know. I'll find it, I'll find it. 'Cause who You are defines my dreams</segment1>
		<segment2>You already take me there. You already take me there. You already take me there. Heaven in the here and now</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm a broken-hearted man. Complacent and tired. When I've been knocked out of the race. I've been a fool for long enough. To fight it, to fight it. It's in Your arms I find my place</segment3>
		<segment4>You already take me there. You already take me there. You already take me there. Heaven in the here and now</segment4>
		<segment5>You meet me where I am. Forgive me where I am</segment5>
		<segment6>Where I lose myself in grace. (Where I'm lost and found). I want to lose myself in grace. Let Your love rain down. All over me (over me, over me). Cover me</segment6>
		<segment7>You already take me there. You already take me there. Yeah, You already take me there. Heaven in the here and now. Heaven in the here and now. Heaven in the here and now    </segment7>
