		<segment1>It's five minutes from the show, so where the heck did Micah go?. I don't know, he's not around. I didn't hear him make a sound. His wherabouts we could not find. I think we left him behind. Have you seen him? </segment1>
		<segment2>Micah,where did Micah go?. Micah, should be at our show, Micah, guess that we should find him, Micah, 'cause we kind of like him here.</segment2>
		<segment3>Poor John walsh his hear is bleeding, &quot;Have you seed me?&quot;. milk jugs reading: does this face ring a bell, is he lost inside some well?. I think we left him at the show. I think we left him in Toledo. </segment3>
		<segment4>We've got a roll of duct-tape for the next time he tries to run away. Come on Micah, it's time for your feeding, do you want another senseless beating?    </segment4>
