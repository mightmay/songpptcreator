		<segment1>They say Jesus is doing nothing. They say evolution took His place. There's no God that created the world and. No Savior for the human race</segment1>
		<segment2>They say God is powerless. He laughs aloud as we cry in pain. It's just a part of his sick, sick humor. Forcing us to appreciate</segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS:]. You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off. You can't infect my mind with your vanity. You say that God is dead but you're rippin' me off. You can't infect my mind with your vanity. You're rippin' me off They say God doesn't even exist. We made him up just to numb our pain. They can't believe in a loving God. Who doesn't believe in atheists</segment3>
