		<segment1>We met in seventh grade in History. Then just another one. Friendship was a few years to come. But I knew who you were. I knew what you stood for. That much we had in common, but you had so much more. And I saw a joy in you I did not see in me. You were a light for all to see</segment1>
		<segment2>Graduation came we moved to L.A. (it was) so good to know a face, A friend I didn't have to make. Those long drives home to Santa Cruz. I grew so close to you, Friends from then on through life. Such a short length of time. Left here with thoughts of you that still inspire me. To be a light for all to see</segment2>
		<segment3>And one day we will be together in our final goal in the presence of He, The one that made us be, the one you served, the one that your light helped us all to see</segment3>
		<segment4>You're life was a picture of how I want to be    </segment4>
