		<segment1>All alone in this world you don't want it. not anymore oh no. the cares of this world con choke you out. you got no direction you can't find your way out. trapped in the maze that you call life. you're not gonna make it until you see the light so bright. these walls you built them up yourself. locked from the inside. can you break your way out. which way is up which way its down. walking in circles you can't find your way around. but Jesus will find you. and He'll never let you go. Jesus will find you. He won't leave you standing all alone. He's gonna find you. and He'll never let you down. Jesus will find you He'll help you out what are you gonna do?. the ways of this world have let you down. you wanna make it but you don't know how. losing this game someone called life. you've had enough you've had it for the last time. so watch your back as you walk astray. turn around and walk the other way. you only wnat to live for you. someday I hope you get a clue but it's up to you    </segment1>
