		<segment1>[Spoken:]. Matthew 24 verse 30. &quot;And then, the sign of the. Son of Man will appear in the sky and then all the tribes of. The earth will mourn. Why? For they will see the Son of. Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great. Glory.&quot; Every eye will see Him that is the scope of His. Coming. Every eye will see him, it is visible. Well I got news. For you, when He comes in, you're going to know He's. There; you're going to know He's around</segment1>
		<segment2>[VERSE:]. Picture Christ coming back like a thief in the night. Came. Riding a white horse with the force of a night. Train. Heaven's open behold and overthrowing your dice. Game. With His pure and Holy vision eyes blazing just like. Flames. And nothing can escape the penetration of His holy. Gaze. His eyes in all places recognizing unholy ways on. His. Head are many diadems or victory crowns. Who's the. Victor fit to be crowned in human history now. With a name. Written all over Him that nobody knows. Clothed in a robe. Soaked in the Blood of His foes. Symbolizing the battle won. With Satan sin and the grave. Death has no more. Strength. Heaven's armies arrayed in fine linen. White and. Pure following Him on them white horses. The word of God. From his mouth is a sharp sword. Who can thwart Lord your. Divine report card. That reports the hearts of the nations. Have failed hard</segment2>
		<segment3>[Spoken:]. When Jesus came the first time, He was falsely. Accused, He was reviled, He was rejected, He was tortured, He was treated like a criminal - He was hung up on a cross. And killed. He's coming back to clear His name. Look over. At Matthew 26.. and the high priest said to Him; &quot;I adjure. You by the living God that you tell us whether you are the. Christ the son of God.&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>[VERSE:]. In the scriptures we find facts. Pictures of divine. Acts. Prophesied God provides wisdom the mind lacks. At. History's climax. More vivid than IMAX. The sky cracks with. Jesus on some, I'm back. Now, just try to visualize the most. Glorious site ever to hit physical eyes. Holy angels in Christ. Who gets minimalized in splendor arrives and all the dead in. Him will arise. Believers who are alive become a maturated. Order. And caught up in the clouds like evaporated water. To. Be captivated by the Master's grace and aura. Before He. Activates the slaughter on the cats who hate the Torah. The. File wildin' out and doubt and wouldn't call on Him. And now. Crying out for the mountains to fall on 'em. The dead come. Out the grave at the holy judge they look. They're broken up. And shook while He opens up the books. All sins will be. Weighed not ignored. And law breakers slayed (slain) by the. Sword by the day of the Lord. While we gaze and admire His. Greatness, liars and fakes who hate Messiah they expire in. The fiery lake. Made for Satan and his angels sent to. Deceive. Multitudes who refuse to repent and believe. The. Elect have no hell to fear. Cause we're related to the judge. Like the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</segment4>
		<segment5>[Spoken:]. Listen, there is coming a time in God's providence. And God's plan when He is going to once and for all finally. Do away with Satan and with the angels that followed. Satan in His rebellion those non-elect angels. Those. Demons God will deal with them all at some point.</segment5>
		<segment6>[VERSE:]. In the scriptures we find facts. Christians in God's. Wrath. Two different paths that never cross the cross. Bought the divine pass. The wicked had a mind. Lapse. Resisting to the time that the cataclysmic, Catastrophic judgment turned the skies black. No date. Setting clock watching or time seeking. Only the Father can. Bother with the divine secret. Not even Jesus is time. Peaking, but I'm speaking of His humanity - every man and. Then every woman. Who lives in vanity will be saying at the. Second coming. Set the hands of time back, please God. Rewind that. The Bible says that I'm a sinner. Then I confess. That I'm that. But God is beyond that. Weep and plead but. His fury will be like the turbulent seas. The elect will be. Gathered from all the four corners. Of the world boys and. Girls who thoroughly tried trying to warn you. Of the cosmic. Disruption of the physical order. And the stars start fallen. Fire drying up the waters. But the cross was sufficient His. Death was efficient. To take a wicked bigot and flip it make. Him a Christian. Teach him the Great Commission. His. Mission is soul fishing. Before He's revealed from Heaven. With mighty angels. And flaming fire asked the Messiah to. Change you. Eternal Hell fire ain't worth sinning. It's time to. Search your heart like the google search engine</segment6>
		<segment7>[HOOK:]. .. When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from. Heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire; dealing our. Retributions to those who do not know God and to those. Who do not obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus. Salvation is. Obeying the Gospel, refusing to obey the Gospel results in. Judgment. Obey the Gospel and these will pay the penalty. Of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord. And from the glory of His power. When He comes to be. Glorified in His saints on that day and to be marveled at. Among all those who have believed - for our testimony to. You was believe. So He's going to come - He is going to. Judge the ungodly. And the Bible says, those of us who are. Saved; we are going to marvel; this is going to be an. Amazing thing. He could be coming back tonight..    </segment7>
