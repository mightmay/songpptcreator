		<segment1>I remember when we used to think we'd hang out all our lives. Yeah things would never be the same. Even now when I look back on that I think about my friends and wonder what they're doing now. It's not easy growing up and holding life's pieces intact. Now all my friends are growing up, I wasn't planning on that. I remember when we used to dream and plans we used to make. We thought we had it figured out and now the time has passed us by. Our dreams are put on hold and life just fits us in the mold.     </segment1>
