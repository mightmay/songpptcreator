		<segment1>Bob Hartman. 1 John 5:20</segment1>
		<segment2>You are tied-in and networked. You've got people to see. You have friends in high places. You've got places to be. You've got plenty of time to make your mark. You've been able to get things done. And all the white shirts will take your calls. You've really had quite a run</segment2>
		<segment3>Who can you turn to. When your life is behind you?</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). It's all about who you know. It's all about who you know. When you get to the end and you've got nothing to show. It's all about who you know. It's all about who you know</segment4>
		<segment5>You have learned how to pull strings. And call in a favor or two. You have found some ways to spend your time. Instead of with &quot;you-know-who&quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>There's only one name. You can call on without blame</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>Some may wonder where, when if not how. There's no worry, if you know Him now</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus)</segment9>
		<segment10>Nothing we do here below. Is gonna save us 'cause. It's all about who you know    </segment10>
