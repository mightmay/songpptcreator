		<segment1>Daddy, daddy do you miss me. The way I crawled upon your knee. Those childish games of hide and seek seem a million miles away. Am I lost in some illusion. or am I what you thought I'd be. Now it seems I've found myself in need to be forgiven. Is there still room upon that knee?. If I give my Life if I lay it down can you turn this Life around, can I be made clean by this offering of my soul. Can I be made whole again?. Have I labored all for nothing. Trying to make it on my own. Fear to reach out to the hand of one who understands me say I'd rather be here all alone. It's all my fault I sit and wallow in seclusion. As if I had no hope at all, I guess truth becomes you I have seen it all in motion that Pride comes before the fall. Can I offer up this simple prayer. Pray it finds a simple ear. A scratch in your infinite time. Not withstanding my fallings not withstanding my crime! </segment1>
