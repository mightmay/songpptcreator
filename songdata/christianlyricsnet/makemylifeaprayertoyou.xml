		<segment1>Make my life a prayer to You. I want to do what You want me to. No empty words and no white lies. No token prayers, no compromise </segment1>
		<segment2>I want to shine the light You gave. Through Your Son You sent to save us. From ourselves and our despair. It comforts me to know You're really there </segment2>
		<segment3>I want to thank You now. For being patient with me. Oh, it's so hard to see. When my eyes are on me. I guess I'll have to trust. And just believe what You say. Oh, You're coming again. Coming to take me away </segment3>
		<segment4>I want to die and let You give. Your life to me that I might live. And share the hope You give to me. The love that set me free </segment4>
		<segment5>I want to tell the world out there. You're not some fable or fairy tale. That I made up inside my head. You're God the Son. You've risen from the dead </segment5>
		<segment6>I want to thank You now. For being patient with me. Oh, it's so hard to see. All that You have for me. I guess I'll have to trust. And just believe what You say. Oh, You're coming again. Coming to take me away </segment6>
		<segment7>I want to die and let You give. Your life to me that I might live. And share the hope You gave to me. I want to share that love that set me free     </segment7>
