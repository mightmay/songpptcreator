		<segment1>No way, no way, no, no, no. I can't wait for another day. For shelter in your arms (I'm sure you know). All the ways that you comfort me. It really soothes my soul. With everyday away, those memories come rushing back. Making me long to feel your touch (I'm sure you know). Everything that I'm going through. Because I turned against your love</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Everyday away, the more I think about you. Everyday away, the more I need you near to me. Everyday away, I long to be around you. Everyday away, I realize how dear you are to me</segment2>
		<segment3>This time that I spend alone. Has opened up my eyes (I'm sure you know). I thank you Lord for showing me. A love that never dies. Cause you've showed me all the beauty Jesus. That your love can bring and this time. I surrender to you my Jesus. No one else Lord, will ever take your place</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
