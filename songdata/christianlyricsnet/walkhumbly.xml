		<segment1>How could I not be on your side.                    . Now you've shown me.               . What it means to be alive?.  . What can I give to show you how.                         . Much you've changed me?.                . Now I'll never be the same.                   . So I will act justly, love mercy.        . Walk humbly with my God </segment1>
		<segment2>Seasons they change and passions they fade </segment2>
		<segment3>But one thing's for sure </segment3>
		<segment4>You will always remain </segment4>
		<segment5>King of my heart </segment5>
		<segment6>Jesus, you are always with me </segment6>
		<segment7>And I'll never be the same. . Nothing can separate us from this love.  . Nothing could ever stand in Your way </segment7>
		<segment8>Nothing can separate us from our God.     . Forever and ever You will reign    </segment8>
