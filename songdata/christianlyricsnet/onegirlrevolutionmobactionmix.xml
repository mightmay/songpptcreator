		<segment1>I wear a disguise. I'm just your average Jane. Super doesn't stand for model. But that doesn't mean I'm plain. If all you see is how I look. You missed the superchick within. And I christen you Titanic. Under-estimate and swim </segment1>
		<segment2>I've got the rifle, gonna be myself (4) </segment2>
		<segment3>I'll be everything that I wana be. I am confidence and insecurity. I am a voice yet waiting to be heard. I'll shoot the shot, bang. That you hear 'round the world </segment3>
		<segment4>And I'm a one girl revolution. I'm a one girl revolution. I'm a one girl revolution </segment4>
		<segment5>Some people see the revolution. But most only see the girl. I can lose my hard earned freedom. If my fear defines my world. I declare my independence from the critics and their stones. I can fight my revolution. I can learn to stand alone </segment5>
		<segment6>I'll be everything that I want to be. I am confidence and insecurity. I am a voice yet waiting to be heard. I'll shoot the shot, bang. That you hear 'round the world </segment6>
		<segment7>And I'm a one girl revolution. I'm a one girl revolution. I'm a one girl revolution </segment7>
		<segment8>And I'm a one girl revolution. I'm a one girl revolution. I'm a one girl revolution     </segment8>
