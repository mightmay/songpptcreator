		<segment1>vs1. Ive got debts that I cant pay. I wont see another dime today, oh yeah. And the rain falls down this government line. While the suits get a room at a hotel wasting time</segment1>
		<segment2>And its easy to fall down hard. Its easy to fall </segment2>
		<segment3>ch. But I know Im walking tomorrow. Paved on streets of gold</segment3>
		<segment4>vs2. And this car I drive, its a little worn. But Ive got to make it to Houston in this storm. Cause what little peace that I can find. Is flowing through the bayou, not this vine</segment4>
		<segment5>and its easy to fall down hard. its easy to fall </segment5>
		<segment6>ch. But I know Im walking tomorrow. Paved on streets of gold. And I know my time in the valley. Can only save my soul</segment6>
		<segment7>bridge. They say not to worry about tomorrow. Does that mean I should live for today. Cause right now I cant find. The peace of mind to stay</segment7>
		<segment8>ch    </segment8>
