		<segment1>I guess you could say I'm a little afraid. What if you go away?. I've seen it before. I've been there before. If I have to love myself. Tell me how to love myself. What's there to love about myself?. I just wanted to see that as a person you want me. But I'm feeling the pain of all these bags in the way. And I'm thinking you're just gonna run away. And I can't catch you</segment1>
		<segment2>I guess you could say. That I want you to stay. 'Cause you have this strange knack. Adds a glow to my black. As you chase it all away. And I hope that you can see. I will someday leave these things. I am waiting to be free. But I'm feeling the pain of all these bags in the way. And I'm thinking you're just gonna run away. And I can't catch you. Oh, I want to catch you    </segment2>
