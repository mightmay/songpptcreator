		<segment1>You move the earth. You hold the stars. Come move in us. Come hold our hearts. You send the rain. And life begins. So rain on us and reign within our lives again</segment1>
		<segment2>We're waiting here. Waiting for you, God. With our hopes and fears. We come empty hands held out. Lord, draw us near. Heal these broken hearts. And lift us up to fall before everything You are</segment2>
		<segment3>You lift the sun into the sky. You lift us up. Open our eyes. To see Your face. And what You've done. You took the nails to give us love. And we stand in awe before Your throne. There's no where else that we can go</segment3>
		<segment4>Come, O Come, Emmanuel. Come Lord here to dwell. Let all Your children lift one voice</segment4>
