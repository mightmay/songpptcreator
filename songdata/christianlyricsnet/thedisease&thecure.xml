		<segment1>I've been infected with the latest disease. An Epidemic thats infecting the weak. It doesnt matter how I plead. Because cant escape it</segment1>
		<segment2>Whoa Its my temptation. Whoa Its so contagious</segment2>
		<segment3>Theres something wrong with me. Inside Im wanting to be free. But the more I give the more. Consuming it just seems to be. I know its what I need. To find a cure for this disease. To save me from all of my self deprecation</segment3>
		<segment4>Is there way to clean the sin off of me. Is there anyone with a vaccine. Ill take the shot even if I bleed. As long as it can heal me</segment4>
		<segment5>I will do whatever I need. To uncontaminate and then proceed. Is it too late to forgive and forget. Can someone help me</segment5>
		<segment6>There only is one cure. That is why I pray. Jesus please take it away</segment6>
