		<segment1>Sleep until night. The slowness of ancient sights. Ponder the voice of birds in song. Light enters by the glowing of fireflies. You said Is this forever ours?</segment1>
		<segment2>Here is the light. That comes in brilliant forces. Reminding us of what was lost. Older than time, the rush of ending ages. Stories of ours. A glass to count all the hours</segment2>
		<segment3>A rustle of leaves. Peaked your curiosity. I thought you might be vanishing. Tricked by a worm. Bewitched while imagining. The ghost of the earth took you from me    </segment3>
