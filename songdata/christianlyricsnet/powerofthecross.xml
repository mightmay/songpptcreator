		<segment1>Once in darkness now in light. Once blind now you see. Once a sinner now a saint. Once bound now free. </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall. That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall </segment2>
		<segment3>Once a stranger now a child. Empty now filled. Once condemned now reconciled. Broken now healed </segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS:]. That's the power of the Cross. See the chains fall. That's the power of the Cross </segment4>
		<segment5>See the chains fall </segment5>
		<segment6>Once a prodigal now home. Once lost now found. Once and enemy now a friend. Once poor now crowned </segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS:]. That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall. That's the power of the Cross See the chains fall. See the chains. See your chains fall. See the chains. See your chains fall!!!!.     </segment7>
