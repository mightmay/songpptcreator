		<segment1>it dawned on me that you are not able. to get up off the floor. if up to me i would have brought this up before. but only after can i see clearly. that things have gone amiss. if i had returned it would not have ended up like this. up in the air, falling down empty handed. while unaware of the ground where you landed. &quot;don't follow me and you'll be doing fine,&quot;. just dont give me that line. in this broken mirror you're sullen. and i you would deject, but thoughts turn to glass, and on these things i reflect. vivid, bright-the colors that follow, and fill this empty room. your pekid skin, just a sign of your impending doom. saw you running after, what better way to tell you than this?    </segment1>
