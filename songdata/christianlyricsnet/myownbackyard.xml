		<segment1>Thomas Jefferson Washington. Is only eight years old. He lives with his mother. In an old abandoned car they call home. Since his daddy has been gone</segment1>
		<segment2>From the windy city skyline. It's easy to look down. On the miracle mile. That might as well be a million miles. From Tommy's side of town</segment2>
		<segment3>And there are far away places. That I would like to think. Keep all the world's suffering. At a safe arm's length. But I can't keep pretending. When I only have to look as far. As my own back yard</segment3>
		<segment4>Tonight a little girl named Jesse. Will find it hard to sleep. On a desert reservation. Without the American dream. And without enough to eat</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes you will find her. Staring at the sky. Wondering why so many things. Have to be so hard in her life. And Jesse starts to cry</segment5>
		<segment6>And there are far away places. That I would like to think. Keep all the world's suffering. At a safe arm's length. But I can't keep pretending. When I only have to look as far. As my own back yard</segment6>
		<segment7>I will sing of compassion. I will sing of charity. I will sing to remember. That in the very least of these. It is Jesus that we see    </segment7>
