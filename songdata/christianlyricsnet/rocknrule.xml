		<segment1>This is a waking up. This is your final call and I would never. want to see you get torn apart. I can't believe it. I can't believe you're a part of this world. You were a sick, sad man from the start.</segment1>
		<segment2>Now you're not even worth my time.</segment2>
		<segment3>I can't be stopped, I'll just keep going all the way. You will try but you will fail, just say it's over and it's done with.</segment3>
		<segment4>I drove around Chicago, headed to Champaign. I passed right through the country where the. corn is as high as any God has ever made. I saw a man beside the road he said, &quot;Excuse me, sir. I think I've lost my way.&quot;. And I told him as I pulled back on the road. and headed south, &quot;I've got no time to waste.&quot;. I said, &quot;I guess you don't have faith.&quot;. (Does it matter anyway?)</segment4>
		<segment5>It's the way you wanted. Everything in its place.</segment5>
		<segment6>I guess you don't have faith.</segment6>
		<segment7>This is a waking up. This is your final call. So don't you expect me to be there when you fall.    </segment7>
