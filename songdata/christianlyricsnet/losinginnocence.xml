		<segment1>Im done. Im done with this!. Oh Son, expose my weakness. With the daylight you bring. Thats bright enough to kill this grey </segment1>
		<segment2>Were dancing on the fence. Were losing innocence. But we cant expect to live like this forever </segment2>
		<segment3>What do I say?. How do I explain this grey. That weighs heavy on the brains. Of those who I love and those who keep the faith?. When I know theres just one way</segment3>
		<segment4>We try to come as close as we can. To what we cant and not get caught. But, instead, lets turn and run towards the light!</segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
