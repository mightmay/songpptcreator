		<segment1>Keep expecting so much. Seeing little in return. Desperate for the deeper moments. Begin to see them slowly burning down. I see them slowly burning down</segment1>
		<segment2>Needing meaning in this. Heavy day I seem to bear. Everything comes into question. Lessons learned just seem to tear apart. They seem to tear apart</segment2>
		<segment3>And I am underwhelmed again. Wanting more than you are giving. Underwhelmed again. Is there more that I am seeing</segment3>
		<segment4>You promised me so much when. We began to walk this way. You said we'd change the world together. But now it seems we're nowhere further on. It seems we're nowhere further on</segment4>
		<segment5>There must be more. Much more than this. Please show me more</segment5>
		<segment6>At the lowest low now. Thinking I should can it all. Needing breakthrough from the nothing. But remembering the call. Where it really started. Hearing fresh your voice again. Something calling me to press on. Seeing you again. I'm bowing down. I'm bowing down</segment6>
		<segment7>And I am overwhelmed again. I hear your voice still calling for me. Overwhelmed again. Remembering all you've made for me. Overwhelmed again. Not deserving all you're giving. Overwhelmed again. Another chance at truly living.     </segment7>
