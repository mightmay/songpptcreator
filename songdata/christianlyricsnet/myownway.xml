		<segment1>If I gotta stand here alone I will I want to lift myself up nut I can't i've tried and tried and every time I try I lose more ground slipping sinking feeling hopeless holding more weight than a man should bare I feel i'm getting smaller everyday insignificant and lost I feel so out of place I gotta face a world that hates me it's wants to see me lose it wants to see me fall on my face than I cry to god I gain more ground walking rising growing stronger holding all the power a man can bear I will never say die I will never give even if I feel i'm getting stronger everyday with power like this a world with light I know i'll face i'll see this day my own way.     </segment1>
