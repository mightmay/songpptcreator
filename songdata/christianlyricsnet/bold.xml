		<segment1>Repercussions of what once was said. The words just came flying out of my head. I didn't mean to offend you, I didn't mean any harm. I just wanted you to pick up your cross and come along. The Lord calls us to make a stand. To be bold and preserve in them. Cause if you do, you will save yourself. And those who hear the Word. Just tryin' to keep you on the right track. Because I care my friend. Don't want to see you sliding back. And now that you love the Lord. And you're coming along fine. Be diligent and give yourself to Him. Everyone is so caught up in trying. To save the world straying away from God, The whole reason why we're here. Don't you know that's why God sent His Son. To die for our sins?. So that we can deny ourselves. And be whole again    </segment1>
