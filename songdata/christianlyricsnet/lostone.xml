		<segment1>Verse: 1I can see you walking on the shore- I hear youCall my name but I don't know what for- Truth isI've felt so lost and so ashamed- And ICan't imagine what you're going to sayChorus: 1Nobody sees me, I'm never chosenNever the one, the one whose wantedThe one, the one whose countedI am forgotten, I am the brokenI am the one, the one that gave upThe one, the one that falls downDown down down.Verse: 2I have tried so hard to be someone- You haveUnraveled everything I've done- Truth isSometimes it hurts to be so real- If youKnew how invisible I feelBridge:  You walked this road, you kindly showed you gave me eyes to seeYou know my pain, you took the shame you brought me to my feetChorus: 2I know you see me, I have been chosenI am the one, the one that's wantedThe one, the one that's countedI'm not forgotten, I'm not a failureYou are the one, the one who saved meThe one, the one who sent love downDown, down down    </segment1>
