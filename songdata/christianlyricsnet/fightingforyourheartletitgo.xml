		<segment1>Someone tore apart your heart. Someone let you down. Down on the ground. Someone ripped away your faith. Someone let you bleed. Forgot what you need. Its not easy moving on. Its not easy moving on. Oh. Let it go. Say goodbye. Call this an emergency. Loves fighting for your heart to be free. Dont waste. Another tear. Drowning here. In yesterdays emergency. Loves fighting for your heart to be free. Someone held you from your dream. Someone pushed you out. Out of the crowd. Somebody stole away your hope. Someone ran off with your heart. Youre alone in the dark. Its not easy moving on. Its not easy moving on    </segment1>
