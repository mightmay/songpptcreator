		<segment1>Lord I come before You now. To worship You to worship You. I lay aside the obvious. Everyday mundane concerns</segment1>
		<segment2>Forgive me when I pretend. That I dont need You here. When everything inside of me. Is reaching for Your hand</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Im letting go of my pride. Im letting go of me. Im letting go of my life. I lay it at Your feet. Im falling down Im falling. Im falling at Your feet Lord. Im falling down Im falling. At Your feet and Im letting go</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to live a life of truth. To honor You to honor You. And everyday a life renew. Rearranged Im not the same</segment4>
