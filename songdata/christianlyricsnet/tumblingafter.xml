		<segment1>The other day while I was driving home my world was shaken. It occurred to me that I had left too many risks untaken. I'm always sitting here just waiting for a revelation. Is it ever gonna come? </segment1>
		<segment2>All this searching yet my destiny is still unfound. Makes me realize this world will always let me down. So it seems that the only hope I ever had. Was everything that You are </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm falling down. Tumbling after You. I'm overwhelmed. Tripping over simple truth. In all I've found. There's nothing that's more beautiful. Than what I've found in You </segment3>
		<segment4>You could always see right through the front I'd offer You. Not believing my excuses, waiting for the truth. When You could have turned Your back. And walked away from me. You, You picked me up instead </segment4>
		<segment5>So we'll turn another page and change the way I look at You. And maybe I'll begin to understand what You went through. Not content to leave me wandering and unaware. You took my hand instead. Yeah, You lead me to the edge </segment5>
		<segment6>You're everything that I ever needed. Now I wanna believe this time. That You would love me. That You would say I'm Yours, I'm Yours, I'm Yours    </segment6>
