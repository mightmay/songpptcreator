		<segment1>Shake the water off my hands. And count the moments. That you really understand this disappointment. Tired of always waking up the darkest feeling. Think I'll open up these blinds and get to seeing</segment1>
		<segment2>On a day much quieter than this. I will hold your hand and kiss your face. I think it's imperative you know that I am. Not about to</segment2>
		<segment3>I know that you could feel. Like a girl on a ferris wheel. Falling down the stairs and then. We could do it again we could to it again..</segment3>
		<segment4>On a day much quieter than this. I will hold your hand and kiss your face. I think it's imperative you know that I am. Not about to</segment4>
		<segment5>When it seems like everything's fine. Just look up and close your eyes. And remember. It's imperative you know that I am. Not about to let it go    </segment5>
