		<segment1>Dear heart, Do you belong to me. Or do I belong to you. Just look at all the trouble. You dragged me into. Ive heard it said. To follow your heart. But Im starting to wonder. If its gone too far</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh heart, you let me down. Chasing love, when it cant be found. Heart, weve fallen out. All of your emotions have led me to doubt. Tell me whos gonna save us now?</segment2>
		<segment3>Dear heart. Youre in the wrong place. Looking out for yourself. No matter what I say. And I know. That youre holding me back. And its time for a change. So Im giving you away</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh heart, you let me down. Chasing love, when it cant be found. And heart, weve fallen out. Cuz all of your emotions have led me to doubt. Tell me whos gonna save us now?</segment4>
		<segment5>La-la-la-la-la-la :D</segment5>
		<segment6>Heart, you let me down. Chasing love when it cant be found. And heart, weve fallen out. All of your emotions have led me to doubt. Only Jesus can save us now    </segment6>
