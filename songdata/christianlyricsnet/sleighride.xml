		<segment1>Just hear those sleigh bells jingling. Ring ting tingling too. Come on, it's lovely weather. For a sleigh ride together with you </segment1>
		<segment2>Outside the snow is falling. And friends are calling &quot;Yoo hoo&quot;. Come on, it's lovely weather. For a sleigh ride together with you </segment2>
		<segment3>Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap. Let's go, let's look at the show. We're riding in a wonderland of snow </segment3>
		<segment4>Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap, It's grand, just holding your hand. We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairy land </segment4>
		<segment5>Our cheeks are nice and rosy. and comfy cozy are we. We're snuggled up together. Like two birds of a feather would be. Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two. Come on, it's lovely weather. For a sleigh ride together with you. It's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you </segment5>
		<segment6>There's a birthday party. At the home of Farmer Gray. It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day. We'll be singing the songs. We love to sing without a single stop. At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop. Pop! Pop! Pop! </segment6>
		<segment7>There's a happy feeling. Nothing in the world can buy. When they pass around the chocolate and the pumpkin pie. It'll nearly be like a picture print. By Currier and Ives </segment7>
