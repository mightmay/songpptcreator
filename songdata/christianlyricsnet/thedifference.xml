		<segment7>VERSE 2:</segment7>
		<segment8>You defied reason with love. Took the fall meant for us. You alone are enough. Though we were destined to fail. You opened the way. And broke every chain</segment8>

All our fear is in the distance. We know Your love will be the difference. Be the difference    </segment16>
