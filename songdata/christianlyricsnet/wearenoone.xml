		<segment1>Verse 1: I caught you trippin out the back door, headsore with nothing to say to say. Where you goin what you runnin from today?. In the wrong at just the right time What's got you in its sway its sway. Ooh brother there's a price in every life to pay</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Behind the lies in every scene the picture's soaked in gasoline. We found the way and honestly we are no one.. We are no One</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: I caught you slippin on the wet floor, reaching for something to late to late. Get your grip before the levy breaks away</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: What's wrong? what's right? who's side? who's fight? who's song? who's light?. Where you goin what you runnin from tonight?    </segment5>
