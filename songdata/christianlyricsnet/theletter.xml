		<segment1>I take it all to heart. Don't point the finger. Choose the winner. Hold your own. It's never been always. Who's the liar. I'm the coward. The letter read like this..</segment1>
		<segment2>Of all the sinners I walk before. I can't deny. Somehow you're seeing it. So you're the one who took the fall. and it's bringing us together. Don't ask me why. Somehow I'm seeing blue. and I'm breaking after all. This could last forever</segment2>
		<segment3>The choice has always been. To take advantage. ride it to the top. Still I'm caught again. I see this coming. See this coming through</segment3>
		<segment4>Of all the sinners I walk before. I can't deny. Somehow you're seeing it. So you're the one who took the fall. and it's bringing us together. Don't ask me why. Some how I'm seeing blue. and I'm breaking after all. This could last forever</segment4>
		<segment5>We'll see if I start coming clean. You'll see that I'm still missing</segment5>
		<segment6>I can't deny. Somehow you're seeing it. So you're the one who took the fall. and it's bringing us together. Don't ask me why. Somehow I'm seeing blue    </segment6>
