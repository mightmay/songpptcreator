		<segment1>Great god of might, great god of wonders. giver of life, giver of grace. creator of everything before us. you had me in mind before the stars were in place</segment1>
		<segment2>Your love surpasses all by far. We're praising You for all you are</segment2>
		<segment3>The reason we're here and the reason we sing. is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king. we lift up our hands and we lift up our eyes and sing. you are holy. The reason we're here and the reason we sing. is to thank you oh god and give praise to the king. we lift up our hands and we lift up our minds. and we pray that all we do would bring glory to you</segment3>
		<segment4>father of love. father of mercy. what have I done that you would think about me?. you've taken my shame, you've taken my sorrow. replaced them with life and life abundantly</segment4>
		<segment5>you can see inside my heart. you can see inside my mind. So strip away the things. that leave me deaf and blind    </segment5>
