		<segment1>Well, Mom found her a new place to live. And Dad found him a new girlfriend. Looks like everybodys moving on</segment1>
		<segment2>And its hey look on the bright side kid, Now you got two Christmases. And its every other weekend from now on. Yeah, but all I want is the way it was</segment2>
		<segment3>When love would always last forever. And families stayed together. Back to the day before two houses. When they held my hands when I was little. Before I got caught in the middle. Somewhere in between two houses. Cause these two houses sure dont feel like home</segment3>
		<segment4>Wide-eyed wonder grows up fast. Trust is shot and nothing lasts. And Im thinking maybe it was all my fault</segment4>
		<segment5>And will I ever get back to. The innocence that I once knew. Before that summer turned into fall. When I close my eyes, I go back in time</segment5>
		<segment6>I heard about a love that never leaves. So Im asking you to show me. Im talking to You down here on my knees. Feels like Youve always known me</segment6>
		<segment7>When love would always last forever. And families stayed together. Back to the day before two houses. You were holding my hand when I was little. You were there when I was in the middle. Somewhere in between two houses. These two houses. These two houses. But tonight my heart has finally found a home    </segment7>
