		<segment1>Here I am once again. Pleading. To the sky. Kneeling to the sands shedding my. Regrets. Knowing You'll forget everything</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Why didn't I go to such great lengths to. Try to please You. Instead I tried to please myself. In the end when your heart is broken. I see the folly of trying to please myself</segment2>
		<segment3>I have not yet arrived. Seeing. Anything. Quiet my desires till they die. Until they die. Or align with Your will</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus 2x)    </segment4>
