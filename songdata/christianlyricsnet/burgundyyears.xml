		<segment1>Burgundy years. I remember everything. Burgundy years. Death tolls ever dark its cheers</segment1>
		<segment2>Dark the days that beckon me. Throughout the Northland country. But there was hope once in my heart. When minstrels sang sweet their song. From the cup you made me drink. The potions of uncertainty. My love never did perish. I have kept the memories inside</segment2>
		<segment3>Burgundy years. I remember everything. Burgundy years. Death tolls ever dark its cheers</segment3>
		<segment4>Blood it lingers still yet stirring. Where goodwill was once endearing. I've become the caretaker. Dutifully, a saint forlorn. Marriage to the brotherhood. By oaths sworn in magicians woods. The martyr of my Christian name. Slain by the scarlet crusades</segment4>
		<segment5>Burgundy years. I remember everything. Burgundy years. Death tolls ever dark its cheers</segment5>
		<segment6>Shall the words of misfits spoken. Be treated as jesters' tokens. There is but a glimmer full. Of the dim light you have cast. In time all heroes depart. But there was hope once in my heart     </segment6>
