		<segment1>Do you remember. That day of your life. It seemed like yesterday. That joy it filled my heart </segment1>
		<segment2>It doesn't feel the same. And I'm feeling dry. Amidst my pain </segment2>
		<segment3>Now something's different. The times oh they have changed. The love's the same. Yet emotion's running dry </segment3>
		<segment4>The feeling's gone. But I know you're still there. I guess it's just part of life. That I must bare </segment4>
		<segment5>It doesn't feel the same. And I'm feeling down. Amidst my pain </segment5>
		<segment6>I see all my shame. And I'm feeling dry. But who am I to complain. Who am I to complain </segment6>
		<segment7>I'm still free. You've set me free </segment7>
		<segment8>It doesn't feel the same. And I'm feeling down. Amidst my pain </segment8>
		<segment9>I see all my shame. And I'm feeling dry. But who am I to complain </segment9>
		<segment10>It doesn't feel the same. And I'm feeling down. Amidst my pain </segment10>
		<segment11>I see all my shame. And I'm feeling dry. But who am I to complain    </segment11>
