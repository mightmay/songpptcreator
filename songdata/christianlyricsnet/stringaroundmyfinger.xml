		<segment1>Like a string around my finger. Like a note up on the wall. Or a tap upon my shoulder. From a friend I owe a call</segment1>
		<segment2>And I know I should remember. All the things that I believe. But troubled times have a way. of clouding your memory. Chorus: Remind me. Pursue me. Bring Your wonder back to my memory. You are faithful. I'm forgetful. Of the way that You are always graceful. So let Your love remind me</segment2>
		<segment3>Like a string around my finger. Like a much needed sign. Or an unexpected letter. Coming at the perfect time</segment3>
		<segment4>And I know I should remember. All the things that I believe. But troubled times have a way. of clouding your memory. Chorus    </segment4>
