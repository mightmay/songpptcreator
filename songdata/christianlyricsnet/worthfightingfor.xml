		<segment1>Wait is easy going the best for us?. Why is faith becoming so comfortable?. I'm finding out. Oh, We're looking for answers. We're not asking questions. Let's move on</segment1>
		<segment2>It's worth fighting for... Don't give up, give up, hold on. we're making progress. Reach out, reach out, reach up. and he will lead us on. Come on, Come on. We're getting stronger now. The end is worth fighting for</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, there is hope in the aftermath. Faith will show what's next for us. and we'll move on it. Small steps will lead to bigger things. His voice brings new beginnings</segment3>
		<segment4>We have a chance to cause a reaction. It's beyond our human action. Oh God, we need you to move us now.     </segment4>
