		<segment1>Inside outside, under my skin. Never ending love I don't know where it begins?. I don't know where it ends, I don't know how high. I don't know how deep, I don't know how wide. Outside inside around the world. Never ending love envelops me like a cloud. I feel you in front, I feel you behind. I feel you up above, And I feel you at the side</segment1>
		<segment2>And you, you're all over me, you're all over me. Your banner is over me, I give it all cos</segment2>
		<segment3>You still captivate me, fascinate me. You still captivate me, saturate me</segment3>
		<segment4>Inside outside, pulling me in. No matter where I run I know you'll never give in. I see you in the storm, I see you in a kiss. I've been around the world and never found a love like this</segment4>
		<segment5>You're all over me, you're all over me. You're everything I want to be. I'm all over you, you're everything I want to see. You're all over me</segment5>
		<segment6>You, still captivate me, fascinate me. You still captivate me, saturate me. You still captivate me, liberate me. You still captivate me    </segment6>
