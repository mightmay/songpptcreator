		<segment1>so much stress god bless. I hate the way you fake this. and hope to get the sympathy. I think it's time to break this. and just play it like a symphony. empty promises rule the scenes. alcohol and kerosine run thru your. vains as you in hail the black. smoke that you then spit in the. face of the innocent I hate to. watch you fall but love to make. you crawl if you want death well. deth is what you'll get act like. a fool and you'll die soon any. thing you do can be used against you</segment1>
		<segment2>you reap what you have sown yo. may the hand of God be upon you</segment2>
		<segment3>world full of war so much gore. little bit of love is too much. asked as brothers kill eachother. everybody gets blasted I don't hate. you don't wanna break you cuz I. love you dearly dont have to fear. me I only wanna show you the. kindaman I am do you wanna know. who made me what I am He's the. one who reaps us one by one. and He wants you so throw away. your gun cuz if you show some love. it can do no harm it's about the. real art of war in our hearts.     </segment3>
