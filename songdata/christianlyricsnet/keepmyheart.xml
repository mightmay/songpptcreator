		<segment1>Nothing left but these pieces. Nothing here except my broken life. All I offer is all I have. I lay my life beneath your throne</segment1>
		<segment2>Keep my heart. I give it to you, Lord. As I offer mine. Will you give me yours?. Keep my heart. Till the closing of time. And I'll worship you. For all of my life. Keep my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>No one here but your spirit. No one here to hear just how I feel. Just to know how I long for you. To teach me just to trust your hand</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't know if I told you. How I long for your heart. I've just got to be like you. I've just got to be yours.     </segment4>
