		<segment1>The darkness falls upon the trees at night. My voices say it's time to feed my own sight. Further from sane i cannot move again. Engulfed in the in dread it's breaking up my life. Going forward. I learn from my mistakes. Division of my own self leaves me wondering what I've become. When I'm alone to think of my torture. I never have to pretend i love you. I have no conscience: I have compassion. I'd lie to replace what I imagine. You don't have to watch me fall. Just one one more time dear, you know i have to. I never wanted to hurt you, hurt you. Division of my own self leaves me wondering what I've become. When I'm alone to think of my torture. . I never have to pretend i love you. I have no conscience: I have compassion. I'd lie to replace what I imagine. You don't have to watch me fall. Whatever's pulling keeps on pulling me much closer to my heaven. When I am with you i can feel my goodness it's like im in heaven. The shock of waking up in fear that death in near will never happen. I'm coming down; I'm coming down for you. When I'm alone to think of my torture. I never have to pretend i love you. I have no conscience: I have compassion. I'd lie to replace what I imagine. When I am with you, my game is over. I am comatose with my flase lover. Nothing can break my i have no conscience. Nothin will stop me, until i stop this.    </segment1>
