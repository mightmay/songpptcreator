		<segment1>I know some things never change. But this can't be one of them. And i don't think i can stand it. Any longer.. (chorus). Are you scared?. Are you scared?. Are you scared?. 'cause if your scared. You're not alone. I once thought i was brave---. But i can't stop crying. Sometimes i think im going crazy. But i am waiting patiently. Though i fear it will all be in vain    </segment1>
