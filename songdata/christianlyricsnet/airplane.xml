		<segment1>Verse 1: It was the last chance to catch the last flight into your heart. I wanted so bad just to get there, woke up to late today to start. I've missed my chance so many times before, Couldn't find the right keys knockin on the wrong door. Just to find myself alone in the night.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I wish I was an airplane, flying back in time to where you and I had first met. Feelin high just knowin I could hold you again. Even if it ended the same, I wish I was an airplane</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: With every heartbeat I feel the heartache of losing you. I need a new start and a new way of getting through. Those runway lights don't compromise, reminds of what I saw in your eyes. The first time we met, on that San Antonio night. Chorus 2: I wish I was an airplane, flying back in time to where you and I had first met. Feelin high just knowin I could hold you again. There was a fire inside no matter how we tried could not be quenched. Even if it ended the same, I wish I was an airplane</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: I know I need you now, your so far away, I'm blinded by the clouds.</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus 3: I wish I was an airplane, flying back in time to where you and I had first met. Feelin high just knowin I could hold you again. I said it before and I'll say it again. Even if it ended the same, Even if it ended the same, If it ended the same. I wish I was an airplane    </segment5>
