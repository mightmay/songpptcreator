		<segment1>Sometimes I'm a liar sometimes I'm a fake. sometimes I'm a hypocrite that everybody hates. sometimes I'm a poet sometimes I'm a preacher. sometimes I watch life go by sitting on the bleacher </segment1>
		<segment2>But I've never been left alone. in any problem that I've known. even though I'm to blame. there were times when things were dark. and I've been known to miss the mark. but someone fixed my aim </segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes I'm a man of God. sometimes I'm alright. sometimes I lay down close my eyes. and pray to God </segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes I don't feel good. it's hard to start the day. it's hard to climb the obstacles. that sometimes come my way. if I make it, I'm a good man. am I a bad man if I fail?. I know I'm never good enough. so I let grace prevail </segment4>
		<segment5>But I've never been left alone. in any problem that I've known. even though I'm to blame. there were times when things were dark. and I've been known to miss the mark. but someone fixed my aim </segment5>
		<segment6>Sometimes I'm a man of God. sometimes I'm alright. sometimes I lay down close my eyes. and pray to God I'm ready for the night     </segment6>
