		<segment1>You've taken all this time. But don't know where to go. With all these answers that. You can't even pretend that you know. But you will get it and somehow make it right. Don't let it get you. Don't go and make it right. You always see what they let you be. Your own ideas they leave quietly. Can't you fight?. Precious peace of mind. Not even sure of how you feel. You're nice and cozy. It's warm inside your head. You'll do it their way and you won't even notice that you're dead. You need to realize it's time to live your life. They say they care but they're longing something dry. [Chorus].     </segment1>
