		<segment1>I was fallen from the first. I am not a stranger to the darkness. Walked the road of prodigals. And crawled upon my knees to You</segment1>
		<segment2>From the ashes and the dirt. You fashion beauty from the wounds Ive carried. Nothing lost, and all redeemed in You</segment2>
		<segment3>Beautifully broken in Your eyes. You see the man my sins disguise. You took my place. You saved my life. Miraculous love, sweet sacrifice. Beautifully broken. You were beautifully broken</segment3>
		<segment4>So You see me as Your own. Holy in the light of Your redemption. By the blood and by the thorn. Were called to life</segment4>
		<segment5>In this weakness You find strength. You find sinners who are saints. And I find amazing grace. In this sacrifice. In this death is life    </segment5>
