		<segment1>Find me, where you can find me. So tired of hiding behind these songs. And take me where you will take me. Back to a place I've know all along. the voice that calms the waves, sing out. And call my name </segment1>
		<segment2>Sing over me, Sing over me. Sing above the noise that Ive been making. Sing over me Sing over me. All I ever needed was to hear your melody. All I ever needed was to hear your melody </segment2>
		<segment3>Wake me, come on and wake me. So tired of living like Im asleep. And hold me the way you hold me. How you unfold all this unbelief. The voice that calms the waves, sing out. And call my name </segment3>
		<segment4>Sing over me, sing over me. Sing away the silence that is breaking. Sing over me sing over me </segment4>
		<segment5>All I ever needed was to hear you melody. All I ever needed was to hear your melody. Sing out, sing out, sing out my love. Sing out, sing out, sing out my love </segment5>
		<segment6>Sing over me, Sing over me. Sing above the noise that Ive been making. Sing over me Sing over me. All I ever needed was to hear your melody. All I ever needed was to hear your melody </segment6>
		<segment7>Sing over me, sing over me. Sing away the silence that is breaking. Sing over me sing over me. All I ever needed was to hear you melody. All I ever needed was to hear your melody. All I ever wanted was to be your melody. Sing out, sing out, sing out my love. Sing out    </segment7>
