		<segment1>And what I saw today was more than I can take. I'll say this honestly. I was afraid. And the pieces are coming together now. But there's still just so many things to figure out. This time there's so many things that I would want the world to take away. This time it feels so right. And its time is done, it's time to run. And it's all you have. And it's all you have for now</segment1>
		<segment2>Leave the past, there's nothing left. And it's over now, I'll show you how. And it's all you have. And it's all you have for now</segment2>
		<segment3>You know it 'cause you thought about it. And when you sing about it, it's all right. Don't be afraid to let it go(oh). And the pieces are coming together now. But there's still just so many things to figure out. This time there's so many things that I would want the world to take away</segment3>
		<segment4>This time it feels so right. And its time is done, it's time to run. And it's all you have. And it's all you have for now. Leave the past, there's nothing left. And it's over now, I'll show you how. And it's all you have. And it's all you have for now</segment4>
		<segment5>All this pain, it's a shame. You never talk about it. You know in so many words it's all right. It's a game on your face, you know you can't deny it. And now it's you in the dark until sunrise</segment5>
		<segment6>This time it feels so right. And its time is done, it's time to run. And it's, it's all you have. For now. Leave the past, there's nothing left. And it's over now, I'll show you how. And it's all you have. And it's all you have    </segment6>
