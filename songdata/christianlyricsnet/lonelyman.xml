		<segment1>I got some game and I got some style. you best beware I'm a real wild child. my secret's safe, can't read my mind. to get to me you've got to get in line. I am a lonely man. I am a lonely man. I lost everything on the number 10. you gotta pay if you wanna plat. I tossed my dice on the green felt skin. you gotta pay if you wanna play. it all comes down so I break it down. it all comes down so I break it down. it all comes down so I break it down. it all breaks down. take some time you can see inside. the little man that I try to hide. you'll never know me 'cause I've always lied. you'll never know all the tears I've cried. I want something to believe in. I want to see what I cannot see     </segment1>
