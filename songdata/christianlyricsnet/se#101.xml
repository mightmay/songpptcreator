		<segment1>These four walls and late nights brooding. Never changing, never moving. It seems, it seems. Momentum's at a crawl. The ants are in the kitchen. The mice are in the walls. This noise in my head. Could make this building fall </segment1>
		<segment2>I've got to get out of here. And I gotta get out now before I crack </segment2>
		<segment3>Mac &amp; Cheese and minute rice. And instant pleasure's always nice. It seems, it seems. Real things take much too long. And I say now's the time to take a stand. And sit back down hasty young man. Did you really think the world. And all it's offered. Could have done you so much wrong? </segment3>
		<segment4>SE #101 forever. SE #101 till I die.     </segment4>
