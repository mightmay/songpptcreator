		<segment1>Did you think you were immune to this?. Did you think you could escape without infection?. You do all you're able to resist just to avoid the danger of rejection</segment1>
		<segment2>Memory warns you of the past when it all went wrong</segment2>
		<segment3>When you think your life is shattered. And there's no way to be fixed again. Love heals your heart. At a time you least expected. You're alive like you have never been. Love heals your heart</segment3>
		<segment4>Everybody has a wall to climb. That was built to guard the pain that hold them captive. Every smile that they would hide behind. Will try to mask the hurt beneath the surface</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes, it's hard to understand how we're trapped inside.     </segment5>
