		<segment1>I lay down. And I close my eyes. But I won't go to sleep tonight. There's too much on my mind. Holy God. You seem to be twice as far away from me. Than you have ever been before</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Hold me safely in Your arms. And clear my crowded mind. And whisper words of peace. In the dark. Whisper to me. Oh, whisper</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm afraid but they don't know it. I feel so weak. But I can't show it. So here I lay. Crying out with hears</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS: Hold me gently in Your arms. And calm my beating heart. And whisper words of hope. In the dark. Whisper to me. Oh, whisper</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE: Whisper. Make the day sleep. Make the noise cease. And give me peace. Whisper to me. How I need to hear You whisper. Whisper to me. Oh, Whisper</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS: Hold me gently in Your arms. And calm my beating heart. And whisper words of hope. In the dark. Whisper to me. Words of hope. Words of peace. Whisper to me    </segment6>
