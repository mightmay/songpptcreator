		<segment1>Being desperate. It's so revealing of what things really mean. It can give you a chance to recall the wonderful. When you could say to those with fearful hearts. &quot;Be strong&quot;. Life seems to interrogate itself. It shouldn't surprise you. You might never know the necessities. And I could never know what makes the world to you. There is someone who know what means the world to you. This could be the opportunity. The stakes are high, and the past doesn't change. The future is left for you to build. So often it can be too fast, too late. And poetic justice leaves no room for the helpless. Will the words ring true?. We were never meant to be alone. And we were never meant to feel so helpless. You are walking past an open door    </segment1>
