		<segment1>Sneakin' round after midnight. There's no one there to see me. Participating on the wrong side. Then I hear a voice in my mind singing</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: When I see you running away. It makes me wanna cry. When I see you. Reminding me of the day I had to die. Don't you know that My heard I still can feel the pain. When I see you, it's killing me again</segment2>
		<segment3>A Holy King is returning. It could be any time. He's coming back for a spotless bridge. Not for those who've got something they're trying to hide    </segment3>
