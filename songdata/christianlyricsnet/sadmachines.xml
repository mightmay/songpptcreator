		<segment1>An ageless question, universal. They're asking why. Creation destined cries flood the night in pain. They say if You are real then take it away. But man will only look to You lying on his face</segment1>
		<segment2>Now we lie awake. With shut eyes. So to forever forget this</segment2>
		<segment3>There cries, this agony, injustices, suffering. Symptoms of a larger disease. Inside of me and you and me. So try to close you eyes and make it fade away. But open and you'll see. This stain is you, this stain is me</segment3>
		<segment4>Now so many wonder why it is. So much has gone awry in all of this. And being makes you sigh that you exist. But you can't escape this. Seemingly undeserved is your lot. But generations past and you forgot. We chose to eat our fill and fell to not. This pain is here reminding us to turn and leave. To come back home</segment4>
		<segment5>Pointing to show us the way    </segment5>
