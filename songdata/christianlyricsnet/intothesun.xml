		<segment1>It's been a while since you last saw me. One breaks down and the other ones fade. These eyes can see the days break. Too late for the other's mistakes</segment1>
		<segment2>Sit down laugh thinking what have we done. Let me inside. Is it all over before it's begun. Please give me some time</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause we are running into the sun. Getting close to something into the sun. You know that we're falling. We're falling back into the sun</segment3>
		<segment4>I never meant to let you go. Why did I leave maybe we'll never know. But I'm a man now broken on the ground. I'm in need and I think that it shows</segment4>
		<segment5>All this time we're going nowhere and we know it. I was so blind. All the lights are leading to where you're going. I'm not far behind</segment5>
		<segment6>And now we're running into the sun. Getting close to something into the sun. You know that we're falling. We're falling back into the sun</segment6>
		<segment7>Into the sun. Into the sun. Into the sun</segment7>
		<segment8>You know that we're running into the sun. Getting close to something into the sun. You know that we're falling. We're falling back into the sun</segment8>
		<segment9>Into the sun. Into the sun. Into the sun    </segment9>
