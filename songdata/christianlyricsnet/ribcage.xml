		<segment1>All hail the newborn sin. Reject the boundaries and soak the cancer in. Hope kills the filth you crave. So bleed the truth out and fall into that grave. Uphold the brand new skin. Accept the failure, refuse to rise above. Break through the ribcage. And tear the heart out from everyone that you love </segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-chorus]. Over and over again. We'll bury the shame underneath the lies we breathe. Over and over again. We'll carry the blame for the hell that we can't leave </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Show me &quot; The path that leads into your mind. Release &quot; The thoughts you lock so deep inside. Show me &quot; I'm the one who knew this pain. Release &quot; Before you fall into this again </segment3>
		<segment4>Behold the loyal slave. His rotting shell now a tomb where death can play. See now his pride caves in. Alone he fights to stop this dark decay. Feed, feed the lust you need. And fainter grows each plea from skies above. Break through the ribcage. And tear the heart out from everyone that you love </segment4>
		<segment5>[Pre-chorus] </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>Building a life out of all that you hate. We see through the front that you tried to create. The world you had hoped for was only a fake. And just like the maggots that made you this way. I know </segment7>
		<segment8>. .     </segment8>
