		<segment1>i've been feeling beat and brokenhearted. don't want to complete the things i've started. the noise, the fuzz, the radiating buzz. (the way everything does). it's so loud. surprised, ashamed, the object of the game. is sounding all the same. it surrounds. sky deliver me before i'm bled. from the crowded airwaves overhead. conquered and undone. so worn and faded. when everything's become. so complicated. a lot to say, but always on the fray. and never in the way you wanted. and so, for me a decent melody. is what i want to leave undaunted. an old song, an old line. it's ok it's all fine. convince me what is good. what i like what i should do    </segment1>
