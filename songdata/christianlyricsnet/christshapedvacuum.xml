		<segment1>All my life natural desire a hole in my heart as wide as the sky my want as deep as any ocean my life avision of what could truly be to learn from my mistakes and truly see i've got this passion coming from my heart to leave this world behind for a new start I rip through things that do not cure they do not heal all they do is steal away all of my hope money steals sex cheats religion twists the truth to lies all I want from this life is to be whole and open my eyes but all I see when i look around is a love of death fascination of filth i've got to focus on what's real in my heart to leave this dead world behind for a new start.     </segment1>
