		<segment1>Why must this road come to an end?. What was so right now seeming so wrong. But even the sun must set my friend. And the time has come. We must be moving on</segment1>
		<segment2>Day has lead to this night. Time to say our goodbyes. And move on. Remember me well </segment2>
		<segment3>Cherishing the good times. Forgiving all the bad times. Moving on. Remember me well</segment3>
		<segment4>A not so distant melody. Singing softly, ringing in my ear. A bittersweet memory. With now one too many tears</segment4>
		<segment5>Day has lead to this night. Time to say our goodbyes. And move on. Remember me well</segment5>
		<segment6>Cherishing the good times. Forgiving all the bad times. Moving on. Remember me well</segment6>
		<segment7>Just one last look. Back to yesterday. Just one more tear. Cried for yesterday</segment7>
		<segment8>Day has lead to this night. Time to say our goodbyes. And move on. Remember me well </segment8>
		<segment9>Cherishing the good times. Forgiving all the bad times. Moving on. I'll remember you well. I'll remember you well</segment9>
