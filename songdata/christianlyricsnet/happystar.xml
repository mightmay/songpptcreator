		<segment1>My heart is telling me. You're more than praiseworthy. I bow before your name everyday. because You're the only one for me yeah!. No more living in fantasy. You took away my hypocrisy. I thank You for everything. You're the only one. once I was lost nowhere to be found. that was then and this is now. You freed me from my chains of sin. You broke the lock that I locked within. You gave me hope and peace inside. You're the only one for me yeah. I'm kneeling down as I sing this song. I want to praise you all day long. I thank you for everything. You're the only one. once Iwas blind I couldn't see. You took my blindfold off of me. You're my God. I'm not. saved me. my Lord and King    </segment1>
