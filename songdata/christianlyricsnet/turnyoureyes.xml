		<segment1>V1:I'll lead you in ways you have not knownI'll guide you through the dark of the nightChorus:Turn your eyes upon me nowBe Still When you can't figure it out Turn your EyesV2:Forget about the former things you've doneI will make you shine like the dawnBridge:And I will not forsake youAnd I will hold you nearMy Love is stronger than death, Truer than life, greater than fear    </segment1>
