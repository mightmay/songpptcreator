		<segment1>Take me there to the place where You are. Take me there, Take me there. I just wanna be where You are. Hide me in Your shelter. Hide me here, hide me here. I just wanna be where You are </segment1>
		<segment2>You have buried my sin in the depths, my Lord. And You've covered me from the furious storm. And You've kept me in the cleft of Your rock. And You've loved me there right from the start! </segment2>
		<segment3>Take me there to the place where You are. Take me there, Take me there. I just wanna be where You are. Hide me in Your shelter. Hide me here, hide me here. I just wanna be where You are </segment3>
		<segment4>You are here and I can feel You. I just love to be where You are. Hide me in this shelter. I just love to be where You are.     </segment4>
