		<segment1>Her body twitches, unbearable pain. Lord bring me out of this, why doesn't he stop, love does not exist. Her insides feel like an unbearable hell. Confusion runs through her mind. She prays so loud, she cries from the inside. why, why, why, why, how could someone do this to me?. He has taken this gift from her, fright in her eyes, he doesn't even flinch, persistence on his face. Her body lay helpless as the shock kicks in. Thoughts of death only enter in. Why was I raped? Why did he do this to me, I thought he loved me, but now my inside bleed. Scared for life, I face this world. Only the Lord helps me make it through each day. How can you look in a girl's eye. and use her body for your own please?. This one's for the child molesters, this one's for the people who rape!. My God powerful will burn your bridged down!. Planned attack on your soul to defeat the evil and make you whole. If no change, then hell your fate. When you rape you take the most important thing in a young girls life. Those who have been raped: you are in my prayers.. God hears your cries    </segment1>
