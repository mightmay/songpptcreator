		<segment1>Come in a little close dear, listen to this tale. About your brother next to you. Why it is he failed. I got a secret, I can't keep it inside. So there's this secret. I'm glad it isn't mine. It's killing me to keep it in. This burden isn't fair. Listen to this story, mask it with a prayer. Brother why is it you find?. Is it your quest to tell?. The troubles that haunt our closest kin. Is time ours to sell?. We tear apart the inside. Working towards dividing our intentions. Locking all our doors. Whisper in my ear. Voice your silence. Who are we to judge?. I see a painted portrait in the hallway. All alone. The light brightens its texture. I see the artist's every stroke. I close the curtains to dim the light, so the beauty fades away    </segment1>
