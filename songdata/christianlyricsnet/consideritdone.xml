		<segment1>Sometimes you wanna laugh, sometimes you wanna cry. Youre just not good enough no matter how you try. So you go on but you know somethings wrong. You meant it when you asked Him in down on your knees. Somehow you lost the thrill and thrills are what you need. To let you know where youre gonna go. (You struggle on) trying to earn what Hes given you. (You struggle on) He died to give it what more can you do</segment1>
		<segment2>So consider it, consider it done. That prize youre fighting for is already won. So consider it, consider it done. Youll find his works just begun. When you consider it done</segment2>
		<segment3>God helps the ones who help themselves, some people say. But are we helping out or getting in His way. He wants our best and Hell do the rest. Its by His grace were saved. Not by the things we do. So weve got to serve Him with a thankful attitude. And let Him know where He leads well go. (From this day on) our hopes in Jesus and His works complete. (From this day on) He makes his experience our history</segment3>
		<segment4>So consider it, consider it done. That prize youre fighting for is already won. So consider it, consider it done. Youll find his works just begun. When you consider it done.     </segment4>
