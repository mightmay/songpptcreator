		<segment1>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind but now I see </segment1>
		<segment2>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Was blind but now I see </segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). Because your love came down. Your love came down. Your love came down. And it saved, it saved me</segment3>
		<segment4>. Through many dangers, toils and snares. I have already come. 'Twas grace that brought me safe this far. And grace will lead me home </segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus 2). Cause your love came down. And you turned me around. And your love came down. And it saved me, it saved me</segment6>
		<segment7>When we've been there ten thousand years. Bright-shining as the sun. We've no less days to sing God's praise. Than when we first begun</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus). (Chorus 2). (Chorus). (Chorus 2)</segment8>
		<segment9>Thanks to KJM for these lyrics.     </segment9>
