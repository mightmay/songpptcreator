		<segment1>Leave the past, and set pace high for the future. We're making our way. This makes me believe in us again. Persevere. Hold these bonds at strong. Ignite the fire. With one foot in front of the other. The results I'm sure will speak for themselves. We can pave the way for days of hope and change. See the standards high, rebuilding self-control. And burn all the wasted time. We must leave behind this modern way of reason. It's something that comes all too natural. Resolution to relive struggle. Opening one's own heart. And push ourselves to the edge. It's not for pride or to accomplish success. It's not for number one, but it's for you. I believe we can change this town    </segment1>
