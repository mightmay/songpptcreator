		<segment1>I can't believe that I've failed again, I've damaged our friendship so many times, but I will try to change if you still have. some faith in me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Anyone who hurts an eye, brings tears out. Anyone who hurts a heart brings out some truth. And anyone who hurts his friend, destroys the friendship</segment2>
		<segment3>If I ever said harsh words to you, or raised my fist against you. But we haven't lost everything. I still have this chance to make things right.</segment3>
		<segment4>If you'll (only) give me that chance.</segment4>
		<segment5>I still got to know: No friend will stay at my side, if I call him a fraud, treat him like dirt, or stab him in the back. No friend will stay at my side.    </segment5>
