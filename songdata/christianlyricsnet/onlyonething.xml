		<segment1>Only one thing cannot fail. Only one thing will never die. Only one thing is sure and stable. Even when I turn and turn and turn. Only one thing, deeper than the ocean. Only one thing is higher still. Only one thing has such devotion. Waiting arms wide until my will gives way</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Your love reaches across the miles I raced. To separate me from You. Your love cradles me like a child when. I finally reach for you. Your love's beyond my understanding. Only one thing</segment2>
		<segment3>Only one thing is always faithful. Only one thing is ever pure. Only one thing, completely able. Only one thing will endure forever</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>I could sing of Your love forever</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
