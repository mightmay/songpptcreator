		<segment1>I know that faith is easy. when everything is going well. But can you still believe in Me. when your life's a living hell?. And when all the things around you. seem to quickly fade away. There's just one thing. I really want to know</segment1>
		<segment2>Will you let go?. (I'll trust you, Lord). Will you stand on My word?. (I'll trust you, Lord). Against all odds. will you believe what I have said?. (I'll trust You, Lord). What seems impossible. (I'll trust You, Lord). Will you believe?. (I'll trust You, Lord). Every promise that I made will you receive?. (Yes, I will trust You, Lord)</segment2>
		<segment3>I know how bad it hurt you. when that loved one's life came to an end. And when they had to leve you. you said you'd never love again. But will you trust that I can help you. and I'll never turn away?. Will you trust Me, child, no matter, come what may?</segment3>
		<segment4>What if it hurts?. (I'll trust You, Lord). What if you cry?. (I'll trust You, Lord). What if it doesn't work out. the first time that you try? (I'll trust You, Lord). What if you call My name. (I'll trust You, lord). And you don't feel Me near?. (I'll trust You, Lord). Will you believe in Me or will you fear?. Oh, my child?. (Yes, I will trust, You Lord)</segment4>
		<segment5>I will trust (3 Times). Oh, oh, oh, oh     </segment5>
