		<segment1>I sit here with your dreams. They are screaming with. A perpetuate and constant flowing. Rhyming and flowing. </segment1>
		<segment2>You mean the world to me. Are we ok? Maybe we can talk about it. </segment2>
		<segment3>Do you feel prettier now?. Do you feel? </segment3>
		<segment4>I can make this last. And I can hold you tightly. When loneliness has never felt so alive. </segment4>
		<segment5>You look beautiful now. You look prettier now. </segment5>
		<segment6>You mean the world to me. Are you ok? Maybe we can talk about it    </segment6>
