		<segment1>All have walls to be torn apart. Cold hard places rising up in the heart. Standing in between what's holy and what's not. We walk around deserts alone. Chipping in vain at towering stones. 'Til we find they're impossible to break without God </segment1>
		<segment2>To be like Joshua. Who trusted the Holy One. A willing instrument. Who let God get the job done </segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. It takes a Jericho faith. Blind belief. Following the voice when you cannot see. Walking God's way. Hearing His sound. Jericho faith. Makes the walls come down </segment3>
		<segment4>All have things to conquer down here. But faith makes ruins out of pride and fear. With the Father's hands we can level barriers. He's crumbling before our eyes. Smashing to pieces every wall inside. We're living and learning to be stronger than we were </segment4>
		<segment5>No matter how great the size. Of the stumbling block. We gotta know that God. Can make rubble out of rock    </segment5>
