		<segment1>The scar that's in my side says. As the sea is wide my love is more so. Im everything you need. Dont you know the blood I bleed is for you - don't you know</segment1>
		<segment2>I bridged the gap you see. Ill supply your every lack and need. To bring you back to me. Youre so valuable</segment2>
		<segment3>Child can't you see. Youre worth more than all the world to me - you're priceless. Youre the iris in my eye. And I hold you up so high - I hold you priceless </segment3>
		<segment4>bridge: Dont you know. Youre worth so much to me. Dont you know. I crossed the line it's true. When I left my throne behind for you. I gave it all for you. Youre so valuable    </segment4>
