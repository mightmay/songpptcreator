		<segment1>When I woke up this morning. Wiped the sleep from my eyes. Found a new day dawning. And suddenly I realize. You're gone</segment1>
		<segment2>Tell me I was dreaming. That you didn't leave me here to cry. You didn't say you don't love me anymore. And it was just my imagination telling lies. Tell me that you didn't say goodbye</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm in a state of confusion. I hope things aren't what they seem. If this is really happening. Just let me go back to dream. You're home</segment3>
		<segment4>Tell me I was dreaming. That you didn't leave me here to cry. You didn't say you don't love me anymore. And it was just my imagination telling lies. Tell me that you didn't say goodbye</segment4>
		<segment5>Tell me I was dreaming. That you didn't leave me here to cry. You didn't say you don't love me anymore. And it was just my imagination telling lies. Tell me that you didn't say goodbye    </segment5>
