		<segment1>People count on &quot;nothing isn't worth it&quot;. Enslave your bodies for money to buy freedom</segment1>
		<segment2>The people are angry with you and each other. I will remember when you said you'd save me</segment2>
		<segment3>You disappoint your fathers and your mothers. With your faith not lasting I wonder what you'll wonder. And soon you'll sing badabadabadada. And soon you'll sing badabadabadada</segment3>
		<segment4>The people are angry with you and each other. But I will remember when you said you'd save me. Badabadabadada</segment4>
		<segment5>The people are angry with you and each other    </segment5>
