		<segment2>Time stands soo still. In the wake of your passing. Soon Ill see you. With a choice of what</segment2>
		<segment3>Life has moved along and know that youre at peace. But the thoughts of your remain. And I know that you are happy. Its not from the weeks or the years that go by. We miss you and we hope our lives and loss have made you</segment3>
		<segment4>Time stands soo still. in the wake of your passing. Soon Ill see you. With a choice of what</segment4>
		<segment5>Time stands soo still. In the wake of your passing. Soon Ill see you. With a choice of what</segment5>
		<segment6>[Faintly says]. Time. Time. Time. Time</segment6>
		<segment7>Time stands soo still. In the wake of your passing. Soon Ill see you. With a choice of what</segment7>
