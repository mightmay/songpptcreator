		<segment1>&quot;Devil, Devil. My heart is filled with selfish. Thoughts of destruction, And things I don't understand. Yet I must find acceptance in this. From the one who brought me into this world. Taking me under his wing, And showing me what it is to be a man. Time has passed, and things have changed. All these things have changed. Do his words still ring true?&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;They've given up. Don't you do that to me.&quot;. &quot;But I'm so unsure with the way things are.&quot;. &quot;Now listen to me. Trust me my son.&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;I am learning every day that things have changed. It's not just me and you. Is there still life in the blood we once shared?. Am I wrong for loving you or just in love with being wrong?. I want to know where your heart lies. That much I deserve. Excuse my words from before. Hate found it's way to my heart. I'll leave my back turned to you. See if my world falls apart. Is this what you call being a man?. Are you a man?. Excuse my ways from before. Hate found it's words in my heart.&quot;    </segment3>
