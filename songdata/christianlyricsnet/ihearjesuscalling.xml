		<segment1>I see what eyes cannot see. and ears cannot hear. and brains cannot perceive. I see a spirit over me. that guides protects and keeps me. from some wrecks </segment1>
		<segment2>I hear Jesus calling. I hear Jesus calling. I hear Jesus calling </segment2>
		<segment3>I hear words that were said. over two thousand years ago. I hear the spirit when he's near. reminds me who I belong to </segment3>
		<segment4>I hear Jesus calling. I hear Jesus calling. I hear Jesus calling </segment4>
		<segment5>Softly and tenderly my Jesus is calling. calling for you and for me. I hear Jesus calling     </segment5>
