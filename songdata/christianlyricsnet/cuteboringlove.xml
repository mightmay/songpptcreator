		<segment1>She said what I was supposed to think. Thank God for freedom. Thank God for liberation. (She said) Now we are allowed to think. Now we are allowed to feel lust without cute boring love </segment1>
		<segment2>But don't you ever just like me. Longing for purity. And don't you ever. Get sick of our territories </segment2>
		<segment3>What are you so scared of sister. What made you so afraid to feel. To chose a stone cold liberation. The one thing I hate most about me. Is the one thing you want to make your trademark. To feel lust without cute boring love </segment3>
		<segment4>But don't you ever just like me. Longing for purity. Don't you ever. Get sick of our territories. Don't you ever feel like glass. Fragile, hurting, letting it pass. Don't you think it's time to trespass </segment4>
		<segment5>But when the fire is gone. Who are you? Who are you now? Who are you?. What are you so scared of sister?. I'm just as scared as you    </segment5>
