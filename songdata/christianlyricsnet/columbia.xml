		<segment1>We all learn from our failures. I never thought I could fall this far -. So far from you. With no desire to look back. I'll embrace this forever. Divorcing my adoration. As death marches to the grave. We all learn from our mistakes, let it break me. We all learn from our failures. Failure is death, and I have overcome it. With not a single tear of remembrance. I choose to forget and start all over.     </segment1>
