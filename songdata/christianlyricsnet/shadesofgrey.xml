		<segment1>I and I am to blame, I sit here in shame. I threw you away again.</segment1>
		<segment2>And I, I send you my best. I try to lay this to rest, When you were my everything.</segment2>
		<segment3>Shades of Grey, And please fade away. And oh what have I said in vain?</segment3>
		<segment4>Hey, and I'll look away, Pretend I'm okay. I'm back on the road again.</segment4>
		<segment5>And please, could it be true, That I still love you, And my loves unworthy.</segment5>
		<segment6>Shades of Grey, And please fade away. And oh what if I said in vain?</segment6>
		<segment7>Are you listening to my words?. And I saw your smile pass me by, And landed far from me. And what does that mean?</segment7>
		<segment8>Shades of Grey, And please fade away. Oh what have I said in vain?</segment8>
		<segment9>I and I ran away, For I was afraid. Afraid you'd be everything.</segment9>
		<segment10>    </segment10>
