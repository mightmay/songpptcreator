		<segment1>Small and sleeping children's song. The kind that wished for death. Salt beyond our lady Satuernn's Reef. Has whored herself to rest. Silver stab in the noontide, in the frayed and edge of the sea. Fell quick to the snow, still life. Sprawled out in the cold, he said. There was dancing on the ceiling. I was strapped down to the anchours. Stumble out your breathing speaks. As heavy in the prose. Salt beyond our lady Satuernn's Reef. Has wounded several more. Silver stab in the noontide, in the frayed and edge of the sea. Fell quick to the snow, still life. Sprawled out in the cold, he said. There was dancing on the ceiling. I was strapped down to the anchours. Twisting down the drain. Infinities of microscopic blades that crawl your skin. Hiding under fingernails and spilling you to slip. Damned towards several silver stabs. Pricking your sedated episodes. I was strapped down to the anchours. Down, down, down..where will those mermaids lead him?     </segment1>
