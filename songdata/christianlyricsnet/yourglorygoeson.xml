		<segment1>Well I'm amazed. By Your wondrous glory. Struck by the way it's consuming me. And I embrace. This feeling deep within me. Worshipping You is my destiny. There's no end to Your majesty</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Your glory goes on and on and on and on. It's never gonna fade away. It keeps going on and on and in and on. Forever will Your glory reign</segment2>
		<segment3>No matter what. I'm gonna keep on living. Even when times get the best of me. Cause I'm in love. With the King of heaven. Whose Glory goes on for eternity. And I will proclaim so that all the world will see</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Lord I tremble with the truth. That You think of me. There's no end to what You'll do. For Your glory</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus 2x)    </segment6>
