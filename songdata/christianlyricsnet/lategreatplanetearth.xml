		<segment1>The world ends without a tragedy. Time is melting into history</segment1>
		<segment2>The sky is falling. Voices crying out in desperation. Hear them calling. Everybody, save yourself</segment2>
		<segment3>The world plays its angered symphony. Lost inside eternal mystery</segment3>
		<segment4>Doesn't matter what you say. Doesn't matter what you do. We all end up this way. There's one thing left to save you</segment4>
		<segment5>The sky is falling. Voices crying out in desperation. Here them calling. You can never save yourself</segment5>
		<segment6>Save yourself..    </segment6>
