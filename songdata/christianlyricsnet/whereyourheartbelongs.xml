		<segment1>You lost yourself in finding out. the wonders of the world will let you down. You gave yourself to those who never cared about your soul. They only cared for their own. It seems everyone has left you</segment1>
		<segment2>You're not alone, I hear you call. And I've been waiting her for you through it all. You're not alone, come to the cross. And let me show you where your heart belongs</segment2>
		<segment3>You've been down the darkest roads. and you know just how it feels to lose your hope. But don't give up on everything. when everyone has given up on you. And it feels like everyone has left you</segment3>
		<segment4>You're not alone, I hear you call. And I've been waiting her for you through it all. You're not alone, come to the cross. And let me show you where your heart belongs</segment4>
		<segment5>I will never leave you, come back to my open arms. To the only love you need</segment5>
		<segment6>You're not alone, I hear you call. And I've been waiting her for you through it all. You're not alone, come to the cross. And let me show you where your heart belongs.     </segment6>
