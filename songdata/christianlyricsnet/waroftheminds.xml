		<segment1>Verse 1: Sometimes I feel like Moses man I just want to run to Midian/ just to change my state but not the state where my citys in/ but my state of mind/ look for a sign like Gideon/ cause my faith is wavering Im forsaking dependence again/ you took me from Egypt just to make me a leader/ but like Moses Im not an eloquent speaker/ Im not eloquent either/ not before nor after youve spoken/ me in ministry youve gotta be jokin/ I feel like Jeremiah/ here are my bones Lord and here is my fire/ Im inadequate to represent the messiah/ call me the weepin rapper/I read a chapter then Im heapin up laughter/ because Im weak and I can see the disaster of me in ministry/ I feel Job I curse the day of my birth/ since I was born its only payin me hurt/ my insecurities worse/ sometimes I wish that that night was barren/ either that or Lord send me an Aaron</segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 2: This song is for you my sisters and brothers who strugglin with depression/ not just the blues but a struggle with depression/ maybe its clinical and got you taking medicine/ or maybe not but you taking counseling session and/ thats excellent/ take your medicine/ if you need it cause this is pleasin to Jesus/ I write this song for the schizophrenic/ who only gets left alone and throne in a hospital only to panic/ and whose family doesnt understand/ so they treat you like an animal but never would the Son of Man/ for those who ask whats going inside of me/ who feels bound by fear bound by anxiety/ I write to you because I know the/ very God whos in control of bipolar/ I write to those who wrestle with thoughts of suicide/ dont do it cause Jesus loves you for you He died</segment2>
		<segment3>Hook:(J.R.). For every tear that you cry for all of the wars in your mind and the fears that you hide know that Hes there know that Hes walking with you I know that its hard to press on when the nights seem so long remember His word is your hope so know that He cares know that Hes walking with you</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 3: The core problem is that Adam sinned/ and since then to now its 8 out of 10/ women and men and children who struggle with depression/ especially house wives and preachers theyre people who struggle with depression/ I write this song for that introverted/ insecure person thats training his thoughts into thinking hes worthless/ God made you/ God can save you/ in everything you can give Him worship/ youre not worthless/ Lord I pray for the mentally ill/ that in your ministry you mentally heal/ those who suffer with it/ if not now then you eventually will heal your children that are mentally ill/ for now they suffer with it/ give us the strength just deal with your will/ because we sinners and we wrestle with it/ just like Job did it/ I write this song for those who were sexually abused/ lookin for weaponry to use seek Jesus     </segment4>
