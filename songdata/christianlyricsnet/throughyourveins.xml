		<segment1>So many people that are stuck here in a dream, So many people who haven't got a clue what it means. So many people that are now becoming dope fiends. So many people who haven't got a clue what it means. Push it in, pull it out, and I'll hold you while you scream. Your body numbs, your mind fades, as you try to exhale the pain. What talked you in to doing something that you can never leave. Push it in, pull it out and I'll hold you while you scream. What am I supposed to do, now that I can't trust you. What am I supposed to say, now that you've fallen away. Time and time you told me, there would never come a day, When I would be forced to live without you now, what am I supposed to say. Push it in, pull it out and I'll hold you while you scream. Your body numbs, your mind fades, as you try to exhale the pain. What talked you in to doing something that you can never leave. Push it in, pull it out and I'll hold you while you scream.    </segment1>
