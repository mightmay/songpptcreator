		<segment1>Death is no conflict, for those who do belong, The very last life breath, starts a brand new song-. Promised to find, what I've been looking for, I guess then we will meet right at Heaven's door</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS</segment2>
		<segment3>As I wander the streets of gold. Talk to all the friends I've known. We'll go adore the Master King, Then only then I'll be breathing in.</segment3>
		<segment4>For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain, When I leave this earth, I'm not coming back again. So I wear this life like a dirty coat, Give up my tattered threads when I cross the moat.</segment4>
		<segment5>Life has no conflict, for those who do belong, This very moment can start whole new songs. When I pass through; die, as we all shall do, I'm going to fall at the feet of the one who created me. and you</segment5>
		<segment6>Only peace, no disease, no more rain, no more pain, No more tears, no more fears. Breathing in.    </segment6>
