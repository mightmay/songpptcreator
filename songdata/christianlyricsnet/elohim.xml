		<segment1>It's been one of those days. Where all my blue has turned to grey. A thunderstorm. Above me forms. And I need sheltering </segment1>
		<segment2>So Maker of the wind and rain. Can you calm the hurricane. In my soul. Out of control. Or help me face what may </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. I love you. I want you. I need you right now. I can't live without you. Don't wanna learn how. With all of my heart </segment3>
		<segment4>I surrender I bow. Elohim..Cover me </segment4>
		<segment5>No matter how hard I try. Nothing seems to satisfy. The deepest part of my heart. Where shallowness resides. 'Til I'm so desperate I call Your name. And you revive my soul once again. Of all that I. Crave inside. This can't be denied </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus. ..Rescue me..Cover me..Forgive me    </segment6>
