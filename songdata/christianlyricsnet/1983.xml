		<segment1>When we were kids, our dreams were invincible, When we were young, our whole lives ahead of us, And it was well understood we'd all become astronauts, And firemen,</segment1>
		<segment2>Let's not pretend, we all become famous, Let's not pretend, there's more to this then we hoped for, For we knew the rules when we were still children, You blow it, You fail it, Disappointment.</segment2>
		<segment3>It's well on it's way, well understood, And you have a place, to be (when we were young), Time on our hands, Still out of our hands, just like rain (it rained so hard), Time ran away, and left us afraid,</segment3>
		<segment4>Your parents are proud, You've got everything, No passion at hand, You'll be Ivy League, It's more probable, We all become salesmen, You know it, You fear it, Mediocrity.</segment4>
		<segment5>It's well on it's way, well understood, And this is your life, Don't apoligize for what you are, Because you're a star.</segment5>
		<segment6>I hope you find contentment, I pray you find an answer, 'cause life is better than your occupation, Revelation.</segment6>
		<segment7>When we (when we were young) were, Time on our hands, Still out of our hands, Just like rain (it rained so hard). Time ran away, and left us afraid.    </segment7>
