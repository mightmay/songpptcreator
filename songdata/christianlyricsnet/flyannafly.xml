		<segment1>tonight. i am black and you are white. and your beautiful gown is making me cry. tonight. the stars they shine for us. and for a second i can touch the sky. alright. this is why i've lived my life. and he didn't come back before tonight. sunlight. the day has overcome this time. and it fills our room with colors so bright. fly anna fly. and save my life. don't wipe away. the sand from my eyes. fly anna fly. i feel alive. and it's okay. this sand in my eyes. tonight. it feels like we're the only ones. at the sheer face of love    </segment1>
