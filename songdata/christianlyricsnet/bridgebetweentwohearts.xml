		<segment1>I dont understand the ways of life divine. But I know something bout the tie that binds. Stronger than steel, so tried and true. Thats the kind of love that ties me to you. Hes the common ground, that binds us together. And tears our fences down. . CHORUS: Hes the bridge between two hearts. The way to cross the widest sea. Right from the start. High above we will be. In His love we will meet. . Dont know all the things that love can do. And I could never predict how the Lord is gonna move. (I know better than that). One thing I know sure enough. We can run to Him. When times get tough. . Hes the bridge between two hearts. The way to cross the widest sea. Right from the start. High above we will meet. On the bridge between two hearts. We can cross the widest sea. Right from the start. High above we will be. In His love we will meet. . We can never know every mountain that will face us. Cant see every twist and turn in the road. But if we keep our steps upon the bridge of Jesus. Whatever we will face we wont face alone. . Chorus    </segment1>
