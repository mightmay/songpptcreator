		<segment1>A purple sky to close the day. I wade the surf where dolphins play. The taste of salt, the dance of waves. And my soul wells up with hallelujahs</segment1>
		<segment2>A lightning flash, my pounding heart. A breaching whale, a shooting star. Give testimony that You are. And my soul wells up with hallelujahs</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh praise Him all His mighty works. There is no language where you cant be heard. Your song goes out to all the earth. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!</segment3>
		<segment4>O cratered moon and sparrows wings. O thunders boom and Saturns rings. Unveil our Father as you sing. And my soul wells up with hallelujahs</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh praise Him all His mighty works. There is no language where you cant be heard. Your song goes out to all the earth. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!</segment5>
		<segment6>The pulse of life within my wrist. A fallen snow, a rising mist. There is no higher praise than this. And my soul wells up. O my soul wells up. Yes my soul wells up with hallelujahs</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh praise Him all His mighty works. There is no language where you cant be heard. Your song goes out to all the earth. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!. O hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah!    </segment7>
