		<segment1>I tried to figure it out. Time and time again and time again. I guess there's just some things I'll never understand. 'Cause Your ways aren't our ways. But deep down in my soul, down in my soul. There is one thing I know that I know</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm in over my head. Right where I wanna be. I'm so lost within Your love. The love that always covers me. So high, so deep, so wide. A strong and cleansing tide. My soul has found a place to rest. I'm in over my head</segment2>
		<segment3>I've been holding on. Now I'm letting go, just letting go. Gonna let Your love carry me away. I don't know where I'm going. But I'm surrounded by the truth. And I can feel the current pulling me. Deeper into You</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm in over my head. Right where I wanna be. I'm so lost within Your love. The love that always covers me. So high, so deep, so wide. A strong and cleansing tide. My soul has found a place to rest. I'm in over my head</segment4>
		<segment5>You see me for who I am. You did reach out Your hand. You made me understand. That Your love has always covered me     </segment5>
