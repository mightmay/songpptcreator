		<segment1>Here I am again. In this raging sea. On my knees again. Deep calls to deep. I feel I'm drowning. My arms are. Just too tired to swim. I feel I'm sinking. On my knees again. In the roar of Your waterfall. In the storm of You. May You find me holding on. May You find me true</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: And I put my hope. And I put my trust. And I put myself in You. In You, Lord [2x]</segment2>
		<segment3>Bridge: Wash me clean. Set me free. Hold me close. And cover me</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)    </segment4>
