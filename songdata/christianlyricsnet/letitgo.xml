		<segment1>I've been holding on so tight. Look at these knuckles they've gone white. From fighting for who I want to be. I'm just trying to find security</segment1>
		<segment2>You say let it go. You say let it go. You say life is waiting for the one's who lose control. You say You will be everything I need. You say if I lose my life it's then I'll find my soul. You say let it go</segment2>
		<segment3>Well it's hard enough to hear. Harder still to move beyond this fear. We know there's nothing I can bring. So tell me what do you want from me?</segment3>
		<segment4>What do I love? What do I hate?. What will I lose? What will I gain?. How do I save my soul?. What if I bend? What if I break?. What will it cost? What will it take?. For You to save my soul</segment4>
