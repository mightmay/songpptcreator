		<segment1>[Chorus:]. I don't know why Jesus loved me. I don't know why He cared. I don't know why He sacrificed His life. Oh, but I'm glad, so glad He did</segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse:]. He left His mighty throne in glory. To bring to us redemption's story. Then He died but He rose again. Just for you and me. Oh, but I'm glad, so glad He did. [repeat]</segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse2:]. Where would I be if Jesus didn't love me?. Where would I be if Jesus didn't care?. Where would I be if He hadn't sacrificed His life. Oh, but I'm glad, so glad He did</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus:]. I don't know why Jesus loved me. (Oh I don't know why). I don't know why He cared. (Oh I don't know why). I don't know why He sacrificed His life</segment4>
		<segment5>[Ending:]. Oh, but I'm glad (so glad), so glad He did. Oh, but I'm glad (so glad), so glad He did     </segment5>
