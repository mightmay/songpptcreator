		<segment1>As I turn my face two ways. Take a hold. There can be no hesitation. (Tonight) Tonight, I must fight. This won't be long. I will meet you when I'm strong. Ashes in my eyes bring scars of deception. Blinded I am, forgive me. Forgive me, for I was wrong. </segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. There can be no hesitation. Take my hand. There can be no regrets </segment2>
		<segment3>As I turn my face two ways. Take a hold. There can be no hesitation. (Tonight) Tonight, I must fight. This won't be long. I will meet you when I'm strong. Ashes in my eyes bring scars of deception. Blinded I am, forgive me. Forgive me, for I was wrong. </segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus] </segment4>
		<segment5>Take this blindfold from me (x2) </segment5>
		<segment6>There can be no hesitation. Take my hand </segment6>
		<segment7>There can be (there can be) no regrets (regrets). There can be (there can be) no regrets.     </segment7>
