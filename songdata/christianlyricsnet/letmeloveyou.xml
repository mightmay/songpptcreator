		<segment1>Try and pretend that you're okay. But I don't believe the smile you fake. It's about time that you stopped saving face</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll meet you where you are, I'll meet you where you are</segment2>
		<segment3>Why don't you let me, let me love you. Oh, you don't have to prove a thing. Why don't you let me, let me love you. For you who you are, not who you should be. Let me love you. And I will let you love me too</segment3>
		<segment4>Why are you scared to tell the truth. What do you think you're gonna lose. You know we're forgiven, not accused    </segment4>
