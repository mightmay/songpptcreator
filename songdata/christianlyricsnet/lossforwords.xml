		<segment1>I'm at a loss, I'm at a loss for words, I really want to say. I'm finding for myself. What can I do. When every road I travel leads me back to you. Instead of somewhere else. I apologize </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Cause what I wanted to say. Never came out the way. I wanted it to, I wanted it to. Cause what I wanted to say. Only got in the way. I never meant to hurt you. But I didn't have a clue </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm just a man. I'm just a man in need of something better than. I'm finding for myself. You count the cost. For everything you gain there's always something lost. You're worth so much more. Listen to my heart whispering. I need you </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Empty words cannot suffice. I've been runnin' from what I know is right. When only Yours are words of life </segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>Every time you come around. Every time I make a sound    </segment7>
