		<segment1>Well, here He comes knockin on your side door baby. Yeah, the Son of Gods on your side. I guess He called ya but yall werent home for the hundredth time. Yeah, you look in Christs Book right after Luke in John 8:1 through 59. It aint so hard to find. The place He said youre either in the faith or sons of Belial. You read on, its really tough to debate it. Dont you get it?. Yeah, I think Hes waiting in the sky for you. You know, our Father up in Heaven. Choose your daddy, choose your savior. Choose somebody whos your friend. And choose the one God who youll come runnin to. When all the worlds lies start crumblin. Your gods your money, but God the Son, He. Says come to me; get saved from sin. Choose your daddy  whos your faith in?. Is it God or is it mammon?. You either belong to God above or to Satan. Which is it?  Well, dont you get it?. If you wait then Satan decides for you. You know you gotta become repentant. Choose your daddy, choose your savior. Choose somebody, yeah, whos your friend. And choose the one God that youll come runnin to. Yeah, when the worlds lies start crumblin. Hes God Almighty; just say, Alrighty. Lets make it real the way You planned. Choose your daddy  whos your faith in?. Is it God or is it man?. Choose your daddy  Luke 16 says. Its in God or its in mammon    </segment1>
