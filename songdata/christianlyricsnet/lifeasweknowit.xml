		<segment1>Bob Hartman. 1 John 5:11</segment1>
		<segment2>First He calls out. Into your darkness. He woos you gently. And you have to choose. But the choice is easy. It's light and darkness. There's an invitation. You can not refuse</segment2>
		<segment3>Revelation - when you see where you've been. Confirmation - you've been born again</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). This is life as we know it. Forgiven and free. Life as we know it. More abundantly. Born of the Son, we can finally see. This is life as we know it. Undeniably</segment4>
		<segment5>One day doubting. You're walking blindly. Through shadow's darkness. You don't feel a thing. But you keep on walking. Though you sometimes stumble. Till you find assurance. Only faith can bring</segment5>
		<segment6>Never perfect, but perfectly forgiven. Finding courage to get up again</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>Bent, but not broken. Tempted, not shaken. Kept in the shadow of His wing. Held by the power. Sealed with the promise. By the One who is over everything</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus).     </segment9>
