		<segment1>This is it confidence is all I need. This is how you're going to save me from myself from all that fails. I see you and me and everything in between and I know I'm wrong but I long to fuel. The fire beneath these tired bones as I dance this road to. Run back to you</segment1>
		<segment2>A place of sweet escape I fell into. My everything will always sing your glory. Progress I confess is way overdue. I get caught up in the things that I've held onto. For too long I've been alone I'm stronger every step I take back to. Run back to you</segment2>
		<segment3>A place of sweet escape I fell into. Familiar taste that you have made inside this refuge I can't create. All back to you. A place of sweet escape I fell into. Your glory. Your glory</segment3>
		<segment4>Sing hallelujiah. I'll forever sing to lift you up. You are my king     </segment4>
