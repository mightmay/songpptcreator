		<segment1>Monday found me on my knees again. Breathing You in. To blur the lines that mark where I begin. And where You end. No use in trying to pretend. Come take me again. 'Cause rumor has it I'm not who I've been. Come define me</segment1>
		<segment2>What can we do. If the rumors are true?</segment2>
		<segment3>I turn everything over, I turn myself in. I turn everything over, I turn myself in. There's nothing left of me to defend. I turn everything over, I turn myself in, yeah</segment3>
		<segment4>The evidence convicts the hollow men. After looking inside. To my dismay I find I'm just one of them, yeah yeah. 'Cause I'm an already but not yet resurrected fallen man. Come break this limbo. And I know You know just who I've been. Come define me</segment4>
		<segment5>What can we do. If the rumors are true?</segment5>
		<segment6>I turn everything over, I turn myself in. I turn everything over, I turn myself in. There's nothing left for me to defend. I turn everything over, I turn myself in, yeah</segment6>
		<segment7>Rumor has it You love me. Rumor has it the world spins upside down. Rumor has it my only hope is You. And the rumors are true. I turn everything over</segment7>
		<segment8>What can we do. If the rumors are true?</segment8>
		<segment9>I turn everything over, turn myself in. I turn everything over, turn myself in. There's nothing left for me to defend. I turn everything over, turn myself in</segment9>
		<segment10>I turn everything over, turn myself in. I turn everything over, turn myself in. There's nothing left for me to defend. I turn everything over, turn myself in    </segment10>
