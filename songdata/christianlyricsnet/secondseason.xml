		<segment1>I wonder if these minutes were my last, If I should start to feast or start to fast. Would I pray or would I curse, Hope for good or something worse?. What emotion would I feel?. Would I run or would I kneel? </segment1>
		<segment2>Time is winding down but only for this life. I want to be found enjoying the next life. I see leaves and they are starting to turn brown. They'll be green and growing when the second season comes around. </segment2>
		<segment3>The strongest will expire just the same, The quick will fall exactly like the lame. I'll do nothing at the most. To keep from giving up the ghost, Try to make my shoulders broad, But I am helpless without God. </segment3>
		<segment4>Time is winding down but only for this life. I want to be found enjoying the next life. I see leaves and they are starting to turn brown. They'll be green and growing when the second season comes around. </segment4>
		<segment5>I may try to grip control, But when for me shall this bell toll?. If the answer is to bow, To him that makes how soon is now? </segment5>
		<segment6>Time is winding down but only for this life. I want to be found enjoying the next life. I see leaves and they are starting to turn brown. They'll be green and growing when the second season comes around.     </segment6>
