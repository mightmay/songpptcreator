		<segment1>(Chorus). This is my world, it's all I've known. This is my world, it's mine alone. To figure out where I fit, I'm trying to find where you come in. Into my world</segment1>
		<segment2>Starring out my window, seems such a narrow view. I've always had this simple picture of you. Ive known you from the eyes of others. But never found you for myself. So tired of living how they want me to. Oh I just want to see you, and know you</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). I've walked the hills and valleys. Ran through the fields you made. How'd I miss the wonder that your hands display. And all those other answers, promising to satisfy. They didn't last, they only withered and died. And now I'm needing more in my life</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>. PSALM 108</segment5>
		<segment6>My heart is steadfast. I will praise Your name with all my soul. Rise up and thank You. Lift my voice and awaken the dawn. I will praise You Lord among the nations. I will sing Your name in all the earth</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus). Great is Your love. It's higher than the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the sky. Be praised, oh God. You're far above the heavens. Let Your glory fly all over the earth</segment7>
		<segment8>Save us help us. With Your right hand You save the ones You love. Gives us aid against our enemies. The help of man will never be enough. With You we'll gain the victory. You will take down our enemies</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus)</segment9>
		<segment10>I will praise You Lord among the nations. I will sing Your name in all the earth</segment10>
		<segment11>(Chorus)    </segment11>
