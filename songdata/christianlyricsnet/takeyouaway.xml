		<segment1>It's okay if you can't go. And changed what happened. it was just a bad day. And you know everybody has them. I get it when you say. You feel like everyone's passing you over. But it's not too late. People wake up off your shoulders</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm calling to take you away. To the place where pain won't find you. I'm calling to take you away. So leave the weight of the world behind you. And you know nothing's too far. Nothing's too hard. I'll always be there. I'm coming to take you away</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't cry cause you know you're not alone. Now, let me dry your eyes. Now it's time that you finally find out. There will always be a new day. At the end of every hard one. Now I'm on my way. So I can be the help you starve for</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm calling to take you away. To the place where pain won't find you. I'm calling to take you away. So leave the weight of the world behind you. And you know nothing's too far. Nothing's too hard. I'll always be there. I'm coming to take you away. To take you away</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm coming to get you. So leave your bags at the hall. That held you down. You can't pack for the place we're going now. It doesn't matter what's going on. I'm the one to get you out</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm going to take you. Where the sun lights up your face. Where you can't remember yesterday. 'Till your heart has been replaced. I'm coming to take you away</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm calling to take you away. To the place where pain won't find you. I'm calling to take you away. So leave the weight of the world behind you. And you know nothing's too far. Nothing's too hard. I'll always be there. I'm coming to take you away. Take you away    </segment7>
