		<segment1>My world is closing in. On the inside. But I'm not showing it. When all I am is crying out. I hold it in and fake a smile. Still I'm broken. I'm broken. Only one can understand. And only one can hold the hand. Of the broken. Of the broken</segment1>
		<segment2>When no one else knows how I feel. Your love for me is proven real. When no one else cares where I've been. You run to me with outstretched hands. And You hold me in your arms. Again</segment2>
		<segment3>I need no explanation of why me. I just need confirmation. Only You could understand the emptiness inside my head. I am falling. I am falling. I'm falling down upon my knees. To find the one who gives me peace. I am flying. Lord I am flying</segment3>
		<segment4>When no one else knows how I feel. Your love for me is proven real. When no one else cares where I've been. You run to me with outstretched hands. And You hold me in Your arms. Again</segment4>
		<segment5>I have come to you in search of faith. Cause I can't see beyond this place. Oh You are God and I am man. So I'll leave it in Your hands    </segment5>
