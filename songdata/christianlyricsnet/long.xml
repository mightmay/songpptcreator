		<segment1>Comrades bond, this day will be long. Don't count your losses, gain what he gave. And we blame him for having right. Anyone lose a God, cause I found a God. Raise the question that's given here. Ponder his answer, still bleeding clean. And they rhyme you've hidden in</segment1>
		<segment2>Won't keep long. And we blame him. And we blame him. Reasons I ask you'll know why. As sure as I'm here you'll know why. Because he won't leave me out in the cold. See how the sparrow gets fed from our Lord. Draw Close. And hold me long    </segment2>
