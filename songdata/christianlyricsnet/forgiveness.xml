		<segment1>Verse 1: I say I will, but then I won't. Say I do, but then I don't. It happens every day, I hate the sinner, Love the sin. It's a sorry state I'm in. I've got to get away. </segment1>
		<segment2>Every time I throw that stone. The fate I'm sealing is my own. Do you know how much I need.. </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Forgiveness - forgiveness. I can't live without. Forgiveness - forgiveness. That's what love's about. Forgiveness. </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: I say forgive and then forget, But I ain't learned to do it yet. You'd think I'd know by now. I know how to hurt someone, Been on both sides of that gun, Pulled the trigger anyhow. </segment4>
		<segment5>When I'm hurting someone else. I only hurt myself. I've got to let it go. </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus:.. </segment6>
		<segment7>A thousand wrongs don't make a right. And nobody wins. When the bridges start burning. Can't you hear my cry? </segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus:.    </segment8>
