		<segment1>It's hard to stand. On shifting sand. It's hard to shine. In the shadows of the night. You can't be free. If you don't reach for help. And you can't love. If you don't love yourself. But there is hope when my faith runs out.. Cuz I'm in better hands now</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. It's like the sun is shining. When the rain is pourin' down. It's like my soul is flying. Though my feet are on the ground. So take this heart of mine. There's no doubt. I'm in better hands now</segment2>
		<segment3>I am strong. All because of you. I stand in awe of. Every mountain that you move. I am changed. Yesterday is gone. I am safe. From this moment on.. And there's no fear when the night comes 'round. I'm in better hands now</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>It's like the sun is shining. When the rain is pourin' down. It's like my soul is flying. Though my feet are on the ground. It's like the world is silent. Though I know it isn't true. It's like the breath of Jesus. Is right here in this room. So take this heart of mine. There's no doubt</segment5>
		<segment6>You can't be saved. If you're not reaching out for help    </segment6>
