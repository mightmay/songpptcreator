		<segment1>Were passengers aboard the train. Silent little lambs admist the pain. Thats no longer good enough. And when its time to speak our faith. We use a language no one can explain. Thats no longer good enough. And God knows its a shame. Cause if we look to pass the blame. We are not the worthy bearers of His name</segment1>
		<segment2>For the world to know the truth. There can be no greater proof. Than to live the life, live the life. Theres no love thats quite as pure. Theres no pain we cant endure. If we live the life, live the life. Be a light for all to see. For every act of love will set you free</segment2>
		<segment3>Theres something beautiful and bold. The power of a million human souls. Come together as one. And each, in turn, goes out to lead. Another by His word, His love, His deed. Now the circle is done. It all comes back to one. For it is He and He alone. Who has lived the only perfect life weve known    </segment3>
