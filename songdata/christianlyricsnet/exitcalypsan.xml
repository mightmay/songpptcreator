		<segment2>It's only in your dreams. It's only in your dreams. So exit the fall, and now its over. It's only in your dreams</segment2>
		<segment3>This fight comes, its nameless. The dark is calling out my name. Escape with, no traces. The movement burns inside my veins. Burns inside my veins</segment3>
		<segment4>It's only in your dreams. It's only in your dreams. So exit the fall, and now its over. It's only in your dreams</segment4>
		<segment5>By now the time is here. I thought I made it clear. (This is the fight this is the fall). By now the tiem is here. I thought I made it clear. (This is the fight this is the fall)</segment5>
		<segment6>Dreams, it's only in your dreams. So exit the fall and now it's over. It's only in your dreams</segment6>
		<segment7>And now it's over it's only in your. And now it's over it's only in your. And now it's over it's only in your. And now it's over it's only in your. And now it's over it's only in your, dreams    </segment7>
