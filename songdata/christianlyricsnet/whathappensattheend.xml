		<segment1>What happens when the song I sing doesn't seem to mean a thing. And everything I have to bring is borrowed and rehearsed. What happens when the music ends and I'm too tired to pretend. That who I am and who I've been could ever get along. NowÂ’s the time for letting go</segment1>
		<segment2>I surrender all - can you hear my call?. When I'm at the end of myself. Is this where you begin when I'm caving in. When I'm at the end of myself</segment2>
		<segment3>What happens when the motion stops - staring at a broken clock. When what I am and what I'm not are perfectly reversed    </segment3>
