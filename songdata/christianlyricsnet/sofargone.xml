		<segment1>I know they say that the space between.  Can make it stronger than weve ever seen.  They might be right but I disagree.  Cause Ive never felt stronger than when youre with me</segment1>
		<segment2> Sometimes I wonder why you even care.  Cause even when I leave youre always there with me.  And like a candle makes a brighter place.  This mark youve made on me cant be erased. </segment2>
		<segment3> I wanna be so far gone in you.  So far nothing else will ever do.  I wanna be so far gone in you.  In you.</segment3>
		<segment4> Ive stood alone and Ive fallen down.  Your hands were there to pick me off the ground.  Sometimes I cry cause I cant believe.  Your love is big enough to cover me</segment4>
		<segment5> Sometimes Ive wondered if youre even there.  But when I feel far away you meet me there.  And like a candle makes a brighter place.  This mark youve made on me cant be erased.  Yeah.</segment5>
		<segment6> I wanna be so far gone in you.  So far nothing else will ever do.  I wanna be so far gone in you.  In you.</segment6>
		<segment7> I wanna be so far gone in you.  So far nothing else will ever do.  I wanna be so far gone in you.  In you.I wanna be lost</segment7>
		<segment8> I wanna be lost in you.  Like a ship in the night.  I wanna get lost in you.  Underneath your sky</segment8>
		<segment9> I wanna be lost in you.  Like a ship in the night.  So far gone tonight</segment9>
		<segment10> I wanna be so far gone in you.  So far nothing else will ever do.  I wanna be so far gone in you.  In you</segment10>
		<segment11> So far gone in you.  In you.  In you.  So far gone in you    </segment11>
