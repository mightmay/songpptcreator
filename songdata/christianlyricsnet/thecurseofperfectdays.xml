		<segment1>Tell me that I'm a fool. That Ive exaggerated the situation. Cause' I've never been scared like this. Of losing more than i have to give</segment1>
		<segment2>Its so unfair. I Believed I Could Handle This. I Swore I Could Fix Everything. But i cant take my eyes off of you</segment2>
		<segment3>And we were still so cool. Our Bodies smooth and young. The dreams of getting older. Were never supposed to come. The Curse Of Perfect Days. You Forget just what you've made. And you find yourself just praying. For something more than this Life</segment3>
		<segment4>Its So Unfair. I Thought i could handle this. I swore i could fix anything</segment4>
		<segment5>We believed we'd have our way (And we did, and we did). The Memories We Have Made (Everyday was the best day of my life). I Could never repay what i owe (Ill replace, Ill Reload). Even though i read the ending before the start. I would have never changed a single part</segment5>
		<segment6>Tell Me I'm a fool. Tell Me I'm just scared. Say I'm such a drama queen. Its not even fair. Let me see your eyes. The love that's right behind. And i'll promise you. That It will Never die. That It will Never die</segment6>
		<segment7>And we were still so cool. Our Bodies smooth and young. The dreams of getting older. Were never supposed to come. The Curse Of Perfect Days. You Forget just what you've made. And you find yourself just praying. For something more than this Life</segment7>
		<segment8>I Want So Much More Than This Life     </segment8>
