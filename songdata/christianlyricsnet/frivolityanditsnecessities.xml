		<segment1>Contemplate what holds you at this time?. Books, self help, pills for your spells. Never quiet for fear no one listens. Somewhere you'll be someone</segment1>
		<segment2>Become everything you fear. Frivolity and its necessities. Become everything you fear. Frivolity</segment2>
		<segment3>Two and six, tricked to feeling younger. Never valiant when it's time. He's someone you used to remember. Still immersed in mirrors     </segment3>
