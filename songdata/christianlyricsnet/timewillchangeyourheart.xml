		<segment1>With big guns and big ambitions. Never ending arguments. When is your ammunition spent. With big guns you load and shoot me down. With all those pretty words you thought out. Ready to recent </segment1>
		<segment2>I hope time will change your heart. I'll be coming against your words. With something inside of me. Time will change your heart. I will be waiting at the doorstep of love. The doors wide open for you to see </segment2>
		<segment3>We laugh about it and we dwell over it. But time flies by, and I'm getting anxious. Forgive me for pushing you. I know you have your own legs to walk with. I guess it's because to me it's so precious </segment3>
		<segment4>I hope time will change your heart. I'll be coming against your words. With something inside of me. Time will change your heart. I will be waiting at the doorstep of love. The doors wide open for you to see </segment4>
		<segment5>When there's not much left to say. Words better left unspoken. Let me hear from you. When your heart is broken </segment5>
		<segment6>I'll wait for you    </segment6>
