I was like dag if I hear somebody brag . one more time in they rhyme all about they tight swag . Im a write back and tell them what they might lack . I aint mad I just had to find where they minds at . so if its time to shine and the lights flash . holding out my fingers to the sky in a tight grasp. then run like Jerry Rice on a nice pass . put a spotlight right on Jesus when the mics passed . I got a white tag plus a bright bag . that matches w/ my sneakers and the jeans got a slight sag . that aint the meanings where my lifes at . its only found when I be proceeding down the right path . so if I speak I know they might laugh . but they never seeing what Im seeing so I ride past . if I stop my breathing he decides that . until that day just happens I keep leaning now in spite of that </segment1>
		<segment2>(swagged out w/ my tags out with my tags out). oh you think you getting?. oh you swagged out you think you bad now . you getting swagged out just with youre tags out. you think you swagged you on that cash route . you better change now you gonna get mashed out </segment2>
		<segment3>Da' T.R.U.T.H:</segment3>
		<segment4>hopped up out the bed turned ya swag on . took a look at ya mirro on ya dads wall . said whats up feel good about what you have on. skinny jeans listening to youre favorite rap songs . all black on fitted cap on . culture really is who you are dont think thats wrong . uh uh thats how ye were shaped . but when swagger so thick we cant see youre faith then . thats when God has got a problem . bragging about yourself in the contents of ya album . swagger is really arrogance hiding behind rhyming . coolness eclipses the glory of God the father . thats inherently wrong . when the glory of our God gets buried in youre songs . so the next time you be on stage . faith up swagger down so we can seek his face </segment4>
		<segment5>these dudes content man is so sinful. I made it so simple put it on a slow tempo . they think they pimps but they more like pimples . they making little sense like a pennies and 4 nickels. you grow little you live in compromise . so when you live yo lives you living lies . the only way they big macking was the very time . you combined youre fries with a number one supersized. Im shooting for the skies so if I land on mars . I let him guide me like the grips on some handlebars . his hands were scarred so heres a battle call . to stand out like hot pink on some camouflage . Im standing strong in fact Im standing on. the very rock whether off or the cameras on. yall can try and knock and go and slam the song . but did you ever stop to think man before you sing along.
