		<segment1>Left to negotiate with no sense of knowing. When freedom over truth has triumphed. Free to be lost and disconnected. Given as much value as free things often are</segment1>
		<segment2>Keep me close to you. Don't let me be alone. Discarded but not overthrown. I'm useless, yes it's true. Keep me, fresh and new. Don't make me obsolete. I still have hands to wash your feet. My uselessness is you</segment2>
		<segment3>I could be worth my weight in labor. I could be worth my death in favors. You could monitor my list of things to do. And you could overlook my anonymous service to you</segment3>
		<segment4>The sum of my marketable skills. My part in the collective will. Abilities that you would own. And use in ways I don't condone. Produce and receive my meal. Discard me when I fall ill</segment4>
		<segment5>How can I profit you.. What useful thing can I do?. (Useful, useless to you)    </segment5>
