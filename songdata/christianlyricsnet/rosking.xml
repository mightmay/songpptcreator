		<segment1>Your Eyes Caught Me. From Across The Room. You've Always Had Away With Looks. Your Eyes They Tear Through Me. They Tear Through Me And Leave Me To Wish. That You Won't Leave The Same. That You Won't Leave The Same. Theres Something That Isn't There. That You Won't Leave The Same. Something About Your Stare. That Chills My Inner Core </segment1>
		<segment2>If Only You Had Known. If Only Someone Told You. Without Him Your Whole World. Falls To Dust. And Thats The One Last Thing. I Wanted To Say Before You Died </segment2>
		<segment3>Your Crying Out For Something More. Your Crying Out For Something More.     </segment3>
