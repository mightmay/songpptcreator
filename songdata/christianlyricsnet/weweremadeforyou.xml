		<segment1>We come to be with you, Come and bring you. Our attention, Our Affection. Were here to be with you, Here to bring you. Our Offering, Here in this place. Deep inside our hearts, We wanna scream it out </segment1>
		<segment2>You are God, You are God, We were made for you, Shout for you. You are God, You are God, We will live for you, Everything we do, You are God </segment2>
		<segment3>God of creation, You came from Heaven, You became a man, bringing hope again. You laid your life down, Took all of our sin. Nailed it to the cross, where you paid it all, Now we bow our hearts, and stand in all </segment3>
		<segment4>Theres no one like you, You are the only truth. In a world thats so confused, There is no one like you    </segment4>
