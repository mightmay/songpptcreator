		<segment1>Another Sunday morning same old you. Hoping that the preachers preachings almost through. Not sure you need to hear this. Seems like youve heard it all before. A hundred times or more. All this information second hand. Is there something more that you dont understand. Its a way of life youre missing. Where the word becomes a part of you. Walking everyday with Jesus. Find out His promises are true</segment1>
		<segment2>Living life first hand. Learning the truth. Straight from the Father. Living life first hand. Theres no middle man. When you walk with the Lord. First hand</segment2>
		<segment3>Its all in your mind the world will say. But this is something. That they cant explain away. Not just some fancy talking. Or just some emotion that you feel. Its a life of first hand walking. Finding out His promises are real</segment3>
		<segment4>Living life first hand. Learning the truth. Straight from the Father. Living life first hand. Theres no middle man. When you walk with the Lord. First hand.     </segment4>
