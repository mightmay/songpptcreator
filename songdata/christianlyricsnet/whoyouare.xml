		<segment1>you hung the hopes of a world. on a shining star. ready to give just a glimpse. a little bit of who you are. when the heavens wink on a midnight clear. takes me back thirty years. and again i hear</segment1>
		<segment2>glory, glory, angels sing. to the now and always King. glory to the One who brings. a little bit of who You are</segment2>
		<segment3>i lay my head in a pasture bed. to this very day. there are few of us left to the Master's work. is it true help is on its way?. the faintest flickers above have gone. but a shepherd greets me with dawn. saying, &quot;I am the One&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>suddenly there's nothing left of Him. but a little light burning deep within me</segment4>
		<segment5>glory, glory, angels sing. to the now and always King. glory to the One who brings. peace and life and everything    </segment5>
