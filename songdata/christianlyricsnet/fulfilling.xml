		<segment1>The life's torn from you, there is nowhere to turn. You're all alone, you feel hollow and empty. Nothing you do can suppress the heartache that you feel. The only strength you have is used to cry in misery. Could you fill the hole you've made inside your heart, when you can't erase your past mistakes?. They say that everything happens for a reason. But nothing on this earth will make the sorrow go away. Your thoughts are filled with emptiness and despair. But just have faith and god will show you grace.    </segment1>
