		<segment1>I lost my keys in the great unknown. And call me please. Cause I can't find my phone</segment1>
		<segment2>(CHORUS). This is the stuff. That drives me crazy. This is the stuff. That's getting to me lately. In the middle of my little mess. I forget how big I'm blessed. This is the stuff. That gets under my skin. But I've gotta trust. You know exactly what Your doing. Might not be what I would choose. But this is the stuff You use</segment2>
		<segment3>45 in a 35. Sirens and fines. While I'm running behind</segment3>
		<segment4>(CHORUS)</segment4>
		<segment5>To break me of impatience. Conquer my frustrations. I've got a new appreciation. It's not the end of the world..</segment5>
		<segment6>This is the stuff. That drives me crazy. This is the stuff. Someone save me. In the middle of my little mess. I forget how big I'm blessed. This is the stuff. That gets under my skin. But I've gotta trust. You know exactly what Your doing. Might not be what I would choose. But this is the stuff You use    </segment6>
