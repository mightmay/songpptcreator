		<segment1>Are you looking for someone to be gentle. With your broken heart your shattered dreams. And are you searching for someone who'll be faithful. To you no matter what life brings. Well I know the maker of the storm the sunrise. He is both the lion and the lamb. He is strong enough to shake all earth and heaven. Yet meek enough to take me as I am.</segment1>
		<segment2>He says come unto me. All who are weary. And I will give you rest. Bring what hurts. Bring your scars. Bring the load that you carry. And I will give you rest</segment2>
		<segment3>Are the clouds above your head oh so heavy. Bursting with showers of despair. And do you struggle under more then you can carry. Has life given more then you can bear. And would you like to trade your failures in for victories. Like piles of ashes in for piles of gold. And can you fall down like a child who is helpless. So he can pick you up and make you whole</segment3>
		<segment4>He says come unto me. All who are weary. And I will give you rest. Bring what hurts. Bring your scars. Bring the load that you carry. And I will give you </segment4>
		<segment5>la la la la la la. la la la la la la. la la la la la la la la la la. la la la la la la. la la la la la la</segment5>
		<segment6>Come---. All who are weary. And I will give you rest. Bring what hurts. Bring your scars. Bring the load that you carry. And I will give you </segment6>
		<segment7>Come---. All who are weary. Come---. All who are weary. (Riff several lines). He says come!    </segment7>
