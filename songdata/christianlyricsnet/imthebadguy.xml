		<segment1>Legalistic people suck legalism makes me sick. I wonder what makes them tick? I wanna go puke on it. Ephesians verse 2:8 states God has saved us not by works but by grace. So what's it gonna take? there's no getting thru to you. So what's it gonna take?. There's no getting thru to you. I'm way to young. To have a point of view. This whole thing just bums me out, Jesus knows my heart. But you don't care you've already made up you mind. I try to change my attitude but it's really hard. I'm so sick of you, God is gonna pull thru    </segment1>
