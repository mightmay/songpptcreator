		<segment1>We met these sisters Barlow's their last name. Ordinary girls they don't live in lane. They don't rate with the guys that score. cause they don't flaunt what the boys what more. They don't date they won't date. They wanna see how they're gonna grow up. Who they're gonna be in the meantime. They might feel unloved when all the girls around them are hooking up. But I know for sure it's never popular to be pure. And while some guys might be passing them by. I think they've caught someone's eye. (CHORUS). All the boys in the bad want a valentine from a Barlow Girl. Boys think they're the bomb. Cause they remind them of their mom. Everyone needs to be loved. Everyone needs their own teenage fan club. Any attention can feel like a good thing. Dress to impress can be oh so tempting. You get noticed with your body. Sexual hypnosis by being hottie you might. Fell like public property. You might you might you shouldn't be. no girl should feel she has to trade her body. For love or be an old maid. and yes there are guys who are willing to wait. Ask a Barlow girl on her wedding day     </segment1>
