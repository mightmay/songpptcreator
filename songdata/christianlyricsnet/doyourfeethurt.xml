		<segment1>Can I call you sweetheart or even baby doll?. If I had your number, you'd be getting a phone call. Can I leave you a message on your machine?. Letting you know that you're the bomb. And you blew up on me </segment1>
		<segment2>Are you anxious to see me. After your next class?. Do you care when I tell you. Step around that broken glass? </segment2>
		<segment3>Can I see you after you get out of school?. I won't even mind if you treat me cruel. Take a ride on my Vespa, I'll take you home. I'll climb up to your window and read you a poem </segment3>
		<segment4>I know that you believe in the one true God above. And that's why you're waiting. For your one and only love. Do your feet hurt? Did you fall from heaven?. 'Cause you've been running through. My mind all day. My mind don't mind </segment4>
		<segment5>I don't know what to say or do. I can't eat when I'm with you. Goodnight sweetheart I gotta go. And you won't come to my next show?.     </segment5>
