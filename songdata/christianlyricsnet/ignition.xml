		<segment1>Start it up. Turn it on. We can ride this storm. A grip of hope in our hands. For the coming dawn. Up to our necks in complexities. Causing us to pause. As we collect our thoughts</segment1>
		<segment2>So don't blink if you wanna come cross the border. Take a look a around or come test the water. We won't stop till we see the morning. So welcome to the quiet before the storm hits. Turn on, turn on the ignition. Everybody. Come on, come on and turn on the ignition</segment2>
		<segment3>Comatose. Half hearted. Room temperatures fine. Sleep walkin' no dream is even fillin' our minds. Earth shakin'. We be quakin' like a wake up bomb. This ain't no trouble overseas. No Vietnam</segment3>
		<segment4>Sleep walkin'. I'm sleep walkin'. Sleep walkin'. I'm still talkin'</segment4>
		<segment5>Come spark the parts in me that all but died. Jump start my heart and wake the sleeper inside. Hold up the flag 'cause its ride or die. Hold up the flag 'cause its ride or die.     </segment5>
