		<segment1>This was not my idea. No I would not have though of this. Though I admit there was evidence. Surely not enough to convict. That a man was not his own. And there was more than day to day. How there could be a promise of hope. And healing that the soul might live again</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Never would've bought it. Never would've thought it could be. Never would've held it. Until it took hold of me, hold of me. Now I've found freedom. Now mercy holds my hand. It took the grace of One living. To save this dying man</segment2>
		<segment3>Now as I look at these pages. I see a story told in whole. Not just segments or phrases. But a story of the soul. And now a man was not his own. And there was more than day to day. How there can be a promise of hope. And healing that the soul might live again</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus 2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>Never would've bought it. Never would've thought it could be.     </segment5>
