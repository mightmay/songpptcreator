		<segment1>Malignant and causing turmoil. Attacking from within. I feel the spit and venom. Burning beneath my skin. Childlike and full of weary. Terror is sinking in. I search for a voice of reason. Guidance to tuck me in. You want it all. You want the world in your hands. Well here it is. Cocked, locked, and loaded. Shopped, stocked, my cabinets full. Go on and break my doors down. Go on and break me. I can see you through my window. Terror breathes in here. Footsteps fall in constant form again. Don't tread on me. Fist to the opposition. Don't tread on me. Salvation of tradition. Don't tread on me. You want it all. To carry the weight of the world. You want it all. A ticket please, for a Sunday paper. A ticket please, for a loaf of bread. Big brother, are you my window?. Big brother, are you in my head?. Hey brother, are you watching?. Hey brother, are you watching me?. Don't tread on me    </segment1>
