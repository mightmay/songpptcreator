		<segment1>I've been waiting. For a hero who's brave and strong-. Someone to love me, Someone to tell me I belong, So I pretend I'm satisfied, And I stand watching from the sidelines, Till You pull me into the light. And say, &quot;It's Your turn now, Welcome to your life!&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). And You call me beautiful, And say You've loved me all along, And You've always held the keys to unlock my soul. Oh You call me beautiful</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a smile on my face, And a brand new light in my eyes, It's a new day, And I've never felt so alive-. I feel as if I could conquer anything, Oh thats what Your love has done for me, And now all I want to be, Is everything You want me to be-</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). And You call me beautiful, And say You've loved me all along, And You've always held the keys. To unlock my soul, But I didn't know-. Now I can finally start to live, Take those chances I have missed, Things will be much different, Now that I know. You call me beautiful</segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge). The story is better than I could dream after all, Now this is reality. To know You and to hear You call me beautiful. Call me beautiful-. Now I can finally start to live, Take those chances I have missed, Things will be much different, Now that I know-. Now that I know. You call me beautiful    </segment5>
