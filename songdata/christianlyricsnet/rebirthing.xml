		<segment1>Verse 1. I lie here paralytic inside this soul. Screaming for you till my throat is numb. I wanna break out. I need a way out. I don't believe that it's gotta be this way. The worst is the waiting. In this Womb I'm suffocating. Pre-Chorus. Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen. I take you in. I've died. Chorus. Rebirthing now. I wanna live for love, wanna live for you and me. Breathe for the first time now I come alive somehow. Rebirthing now. I wanna live my life, wanna give you everything. Breathe for the first time now I come alive somehow. Right now. Right now. Verse 2. I lie here lifeless in this cocoon. Shedding my skin cause I'm ready to. I wanna break out. I found a way out. I don't believe that it's gotta be this way. The worst is the waiting. In this Womb I'm suffocating. Pre-Chorus. Feel your presence filling up my lungs with oxygen. I take you in. I've died. Chorus. Rebirthing now. I wanna live for love, wanna live for you and me. Breathe for the first time now I come alive somehow. Rebirthing now. I wanna live my life, wanna give you everything. Breathe for the first time now I come alive somehow. (I come alive somehow). Bridge. Tell me when I'm gonna live again. Tell me when I'm gonna breathe you in. Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside. Tell me when I'm gonna feel alive. Tell me when I'm gonna live again. Tell me when this fear will end. Tell me when I'm gonna feel inside. Tell me when I'll feel alive. Chorus. Rebirthing now. I wanna live for love, wanna live for you and me. Breathe for the first time now I come alive somehow. Rebirthing now. I wanna live my life, wanna give you everything. Breathe for the first time now I come alive somehow. (I come alive somehow). Right now (I come alive somehow). Right now (I come alive somehow).     </segment1>
