		<segment1>My home is where we used to meet, I'd talk to You and You'd talk to me. You revealed Your mysteries, I'd make promises I couldn't keep. Morning sleep it is my thief now I'm far away from You. And I can't find my way back home. I'm here, I know I'm so alone. I used to sing and stand up tall, I've stuck my prayers into the wall. I take my knees down to the ground, now I hear that wonted sound of Your voice. as it surrounds me calling me to get up now. So I will find my way back home. You're here, I know I'm not alone. If I've stolen, or beaten, or acted deceiving, or if I've run away. If I love You, or praise You, or spit in Your face You always come for me. I will find my way back home. You're here, I know I'm not alone.     </segment1>
