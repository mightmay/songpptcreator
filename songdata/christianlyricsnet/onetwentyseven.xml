		<segment1>when will the weak shame the strong. and not collapse into our own arms. when will we raise our flags past half-mast. and not collapse into our own arms. but shame will keep us who we are</segment1>
		<segment2>shame is the anchor tied around my ankle. shame keeps me low and close to the bottom. where I am the least. at the bottom</segment2>
		<segment3>where pride has never been and never will. the swell of my chest. I stand on this. where pride has never been and never will. the swell of my chest. I call this brave. but how dare I call this love. and not bear my cross to the end</segment3>
		<segment4>how can I call this love when all that I am. is because your love endures my back to it. your love endures my back to it. your love endures my back to it.     </segment4>
