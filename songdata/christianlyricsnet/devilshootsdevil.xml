		<segment1>Locked in and trapped stuck here. I'm feeling helpless. I need strength to fight this fear. Becoming restless. Can't fight this feeling burning inside of me. The lights burned out. I'm running down and it's killing me. Devil shoots devil and it's so hard to see. It seems that vicious cycle has got the best of me. Avarice, Envy, Pride has set this heart on fire. Avarice, envy , pride has set this world on fire.    </segment1>
