		<segment1>Yoke	me	with Your	presence. Lead	me	by Your	spirit. Restrain my flesh from all contrary ways. Deliver me from evil. By Your power, Lord Jesus. You are the only One I want on the throne of my heart. For Your	yoke	is	easy. And Your	burden	is	light. Your law of Love frees me. And is my delight. Whatever	it	takes	to	be Yours. Lord, I welcome Your hand in my life. Yoke me with Your presence    </segment1>
