		<segment1>I don't know how I got to where I am. All I know is that I want to go back. to the moment when I fell in lovve with grace. and I hear You whisper</segment1>
		<segment2>Hang on, I know your hope seems gone. Hang on, sometimes the heartache makes you strong. Remember the first time love turned you around</segment2>
		<segment3>I try my best to pray but my heart won't move. And all the words the saints say, they just don't help. I want to go back to when I first called out Your name. and I hear You whisper</segment3>
		<segment4>To the moment when I fell in love with grace. To the day when I first called out Jesus' name    </segment4>
