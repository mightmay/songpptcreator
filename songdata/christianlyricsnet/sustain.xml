		<segment1>As I walk through this valley of death, fear does not hold a grip on me, for your sake, we face death all day long, and by your hand, you help us understand, as the spirit of darkness covers the land, you hold this child in your hands, and we know by the promises that you've made, that your light will guide our faith.</segment1>
		<segment2>I will not fear this evil.</segment2>
		<segment3>as darkness covers the land, I watch the horizon grow dim. Faithful I will escape, knowing that I've been sustained. God has sustained me, He alone has been my hope. In a world waiting for me to fall, God has sustained me through it all..    </segment3>
