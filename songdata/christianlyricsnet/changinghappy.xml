		<segment1>I've always found that happiness hides. Just around the corner just out of my reach. And the moment its found the next that it's missing. And I need to change my own definition la da da da, da da da da da </segment1>
		<segment2>Cause nothing's ever quite all that it seems. And I am not convinced that anybody is ever living the dream. And expectations kill as reality plays this show of your life. It's a whole different scene </segment2>
		<segment3>Yeah, I'm changing what it means to be happy, what it means. Yeah, back to the way I know that it should be, Close to you is where I need to be </segment3>
		<segment4>No matter how hard we push or how hard we pull. There's just a little bit more til we're full. Cause we've all tried to cover sadness and sorrow. With temporary things that never seem to last </segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, I'm changing what it means to be happy, what it means. Yeah, back to the way I know that it should be </segment5>
		<segment6>So explain to me why we fill up empty with empty and at the end of the day. We're confused by the longing </segment6>

		<segment8>Yeah, I'm changing what it means to be happy, what it means. Yeah, back to the way I know that it should be. The way that it should be </segment8>
		<segment9>Yeah, I'm changing what it means to be happy. What it means to be happy, to be happy, truly happy. Close to you is where I need to be mm mm. </segment9>
