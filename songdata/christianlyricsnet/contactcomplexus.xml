		<segment1>Runaway, runaway. Breathe this in. The waters wait, waters wait. Wide awake, wide away. Breathe this in. The waters wait, waters wait. Asking if you are..</segment1>
		<segment2>Erased, everything within you will feel. Erased now.</segment2>
		<segment3>Everyday, everyday. Houses full of no escape, no escape. Runaway, runaway. It starts to pull. He's in this place, in this place. To question who you are.</segment3>
		<segment4>Who am I?. Who am I?. I will fade.</segment4>
		<segment5>(Psalm 42:7)    </segment5>
