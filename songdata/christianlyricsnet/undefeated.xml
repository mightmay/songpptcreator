		<segment1>Like a band of gypsies. We go rolling down the highway. I've come a long way riding with my friends. They stand beside me. When the world's not going my way. We may be losers but we're winners in the end</segment1>
		<segment2>We are undefeated. And we're still believing. In the one thing that has gotten us this far. And we can't be beaten and we're standing on shoulders of the ones who went before us. And we're fighting back with love</segment2>
		<segment3>Trouble always finds me. Everywhere that I go. A cloud above me. Like a kite upon a string. Here in the valley, the valley. I know there is a mountain top. Where I can stand and sing</segment3>
		<segment4>Love conquers all     </segment4>
