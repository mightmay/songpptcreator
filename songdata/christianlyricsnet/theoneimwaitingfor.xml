		<segment1>The way that girl can break a heart. It's like a work of art. And this is the worst part. She knows it</segment1>
		<segment2>And she's so confident. That she's what everybody wants. But nobody wants. Her to know that</segment2>
		<segment3>So fall back on all of your premonitions. And just learn to listen. To those that have more wisdom than you. And just stop. Putting so much stock. In all of this stuff. Live your life for those you love</segment3>
		<segment4>And I'm still waiting for. You to be the one I'm waiting for</segment4>
		<segment5>The way that girl can turn a head. Well she is such a threat. But don't ever forget. She knows it</segment5>
		<segment6>And she's got it all. All figured out. And she won't let you doubt. She knows it</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm still waiting for. You to be the one I'm waiting for</segment7>
		<segment8>Something tells me that this is going to make sense. Something tells me it's going to take patience. Something tells me that this will all work out in the end    </segment8>
