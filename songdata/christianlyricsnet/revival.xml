		<segment1>If i slip an inch they take a mile they make a life of finding my weakness don't get me wrong no don't get me wrong I know i'm the one to blame an iron guilt the chain around my neck self imposed alone I hold the key to freedom don't get me wrong no I know the enemy is strong they'll stop at nothing to take me down devils come to take my life with blood red stars in their eyes it's never enough for them but enough is enough for me it take strength to stand it take honor to live again it's never enough for them but enough is enough for me to their bitter end my will to fight.     </segment1>
