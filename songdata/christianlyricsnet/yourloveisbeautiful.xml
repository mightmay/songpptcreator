		<segment1>You surrounded me with songs of praise. You have bought me to this place. Where your love and grace, move within my life. Now Your message is my light</segment1>
		<segment2>Your love is beautiful. Your love is beautiful. It's the reason why I sing. All around the world, let the praise begin. All around the world, let the praise begin</segment2>
		<segment3>I am planted here by the waters and I'm living for the King. I have found my peace in the house of God. This is where I'm meant to be    </segment3>
