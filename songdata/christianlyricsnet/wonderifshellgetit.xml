		<segment1>dear diary i saw this guy at the show. he was singing to me at least i think so. all the world around me stopped when he said. (hi, what's up baby) he's the perfect guy. his hair his eyes oh i love his smile. when he opened the door knew he was worthwile. he looked so good standing right next to me. so beautiful i know our children will be. this time i know its true love </segment1>
		<segment2>[chorus]. he is the one that i've been waiting for. i promise to love him forevermore. i've waited my whole life for the day i am his. i just know he's the. wonder what his name is </segment2>
		<segment3>dear diary today i found a new guy. with a movie star face and the perfect lines. knight and shining armor hero to rescue me. he'll be so romantic just like in the movies. he'll play the role of a boyfriend for me. like in &quot;Here on Earth&quot; with leelee sobieski. there's just one problem something i might have missed. he's a movie star he doesn't know i exist. this time i know its true love. [chorus] </segment3>
		<segment4>dear diary i thought my dreams had come true. last week i found the one to give my heart to. told all my friends about him even tried his last name. didn't see that to him, it was all just a game. he seemed so nice i've known him for a whole week. but my friends didn't like him didn't know him like me. no more crushes or rushes learn to be satisfied. with being single again.. -wait who's that guy? you are cute!. [chorus]     </segment4>
