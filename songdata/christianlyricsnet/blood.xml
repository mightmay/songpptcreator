		<segment1>12 A.M., I sit alone. tears in my eyes. 12 A.M. another gun fight. my best friend dies</segment1>
		<segment2>this pain cuts deep inside. makes my heart bleed. now I'm cold and all alone. God help me breathe</segment2>
		<segment3>still my best friend. still my best friend. still my best friend. still my best friend. still my best friend. still my best friend. still my best friend. still my best friend </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). wrong place wrong time. shot tonight. blood red moon up in the sky. wrong place wrong time. shot tonight. blood red moon up in the sky    </segment4>
