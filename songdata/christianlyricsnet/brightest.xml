		<segment1>If you find yourself here on my side of town, I pray that you'd come to my door. and talk to me like you don't know what we ever fought about. I don't remember anymore. I just know that she warms my heart. and knows what all of my imperfections are. She says that I am the brightest little firefly in her jar.    </segment1>
