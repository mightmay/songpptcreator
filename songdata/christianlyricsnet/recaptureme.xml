		<segment1>Fleeing what I do not know. Recapture me, recapture me. I flee to where I cannot go. Recapture me. The bridge between my heart and mind. Recapture me, recapture me. You come across myself to find. Recapture me</segment1>
		<segment2>You come and knock on imaginations door, You come to show to. To know You is what eyes and ears are for.</segment2>
		<segment3>With ears that hear but not receive. Recapture me, recapture me. With eyes that see but can't perceive. Recapture me. Your paradox and poetry. Recapture me, recapture me. You speak one sacred certainty. Recapture me</segment3>
		<segment4>You come and knock on imaginations door, You come to show to to know You is. What eyes and ears are for, (what eyes and ears are for, What eyes and ears are for). To know You is what eyes and ears are for. (what eyes and ears are for, What eyes and ears are for)</segment4>
		<segment5>Through prophets madness make me wise. Recapture me, recapture me. Through foolish faith open my eyes. Recapture me. With sacred words, with silent words. Recapture me, recapture me. You're the living Word that must be heard. Recapture me. Recapture me. Recapture, recapture me    </segment5>
