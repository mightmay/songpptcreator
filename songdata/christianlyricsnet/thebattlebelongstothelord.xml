		<segment1>In heavenly armour we'll enter the land. The battle belongs to the Lord. No weapon that's fashioned against us shall stand. The battle belongs to the Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>We sing glory and honor. Power and strength to the Lord. (repeat)</segment2>
		<segment3>The power of darkness comes in like a flood. The battle belongs to the Lord. He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood. The battle belongs to the Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>When your enemy presses in hard do not fear. The battle belongs to the Lord. Take courage my friend, your redemption is near. The battle belongs to the Lord     </segment4>
