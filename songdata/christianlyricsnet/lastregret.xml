		<segment1>Lost in the game. Finally I can say I'm proud of me. No hope at all. A day I believed would never come. No one to blame. The shadows of my past have been erased. A life that God himself could change </segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). I never dreamed that I could feel this way. Don't wake me please. I've finally found the place where I belong. Only one regret. All those years I lost. For nothing at all </segment2>
		<segment3>Laughing in pain. Searching for a reason to exist. World torn apart. Excuses left me breathless and ashamed. Slipping away. I found a purpose that's worth fighting for. The memories don't haunt me anymore </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus).     </segment4>
