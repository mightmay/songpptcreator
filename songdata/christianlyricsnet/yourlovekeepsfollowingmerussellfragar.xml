		<segment1>You loved me as You found me. Your love keeps following me. You wrapped Your arms around me. Your love keeps following me. By grace I'm what I should be. Your love keeps following me. You saw me as I could be. Your love keeps following me. And it's higher. (reaches from heaven to men). It's wider. (anyone can come in). It's deeper. (it covers any sin). And I know this one thing. Wherever I go. I know. Your love keeps following me    </segment1>
