		<segment1>Have you seen the sun? Have you seen the sun? Or has the darkness dragged you further from your door? Take each others hands. Look into the clouds. Such a beautiful song we sing. Finally finding our own way back home. Such a beautiful song we sing. Oh no, this is no time for excuses. Weve singled you out and the leaders keep running away. The sound of trumpets will carry you home. The sound of trumpets will resound and we all sing. Take each others hands. Look into the clouds. Such a beautiful song we sing. Finally finding our own way back home. Such a beautiful song we sing. Re-break the bone to assure the healing. So that we might know you again.Re-break the bone. Re-break the bone. Re-break the bone. Sound the alarm like a vulture on the nation with silver. Oh no, have we sealed our own destruction? Walking away from the only thing that matters. Re-break the bone. Re-break the bone. Re-break the bone to asure the healing. Re-break the bone. Know you again. Take each others hands. Look into the clouds. Such a beautiful song we sing. Finally finding our own way back home. Such a beautiful song we sing. The sound of trumpets will carry you home. The sound of trumpets will resound and we all sing. Re-break.     </segment1>
