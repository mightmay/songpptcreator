		<segment1>My knuckles have turned white, from holding your hand oh so tight. Your hand in mine feels too right. My tongue has become tied, I'm fighting back my insides. I'm dancing with an angel under pale moonlight. I'm waiting for the day when you will come to me and say. i'm here to stay so let's run away. We are standing on the edge of it all. Take my hand let's go. There's no need to be afraid of the fall. My love will hold you. i'm drying tears I've cried, from finding love that's in your eyes. One kiss from you and I'm paralyzed. Our hearts are killing time, they're dying to be inline. The idea of being one with you is the greatest prize. We'll watch each other grow, and step into the great unknown. This is our hope, the seed we've sown    </segment1>
