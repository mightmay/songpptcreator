		<segment1>Just when I think I've got it, It's gone. When I think I know the answer. And I dare to raise my hand it's wrong. Stop. stop. stop this foolish pride of mine. That dares to drag me far away from you. When I try to do it my way I always lose. I always lose your point of view.</segment1>
		<segment2>I don't have to be condemned. Jesus saved me from the laws of sin. If I fall I'll try again. With the spirit as my guide. I'll never have to hide again.</segment2>
		<segment3>I, I, I try to close my eyes like a child. Playing in a game of hide and seek. If I can not see the Lord. Then surely Lord. You can not see me. As if I could ever. Keep him from spying me. All the plans of this man they're nothing more. Nothing more than evil schemes.     </segment3>
