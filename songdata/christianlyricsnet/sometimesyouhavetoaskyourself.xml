	<english>
		<segment1>Never quite just knew how to get it through. The utilitarian sloganeerian minds. And its time to stand up and redefine the lines. right now</segment1>
		<segment2>Compartmentalizing, isn't realizing. Because it's not affecting change in the real world. So get on with your life and get over mine. There's only one world and there's many different tastes</segment2>
		<segment3>So enjoy, don't employ your state. Common goals, communicate to contemplate. The way things are and why. Don't pawn the status quo problems off on the other guy</segment3>
		<segment4>Your a celebrity in your own world. Catch phrases only catching cobb webs. Spiritualized capital gain and wealth. Isn't the means to the end, isn't the end itself</segment4>
		<segment5>Manifest individually. Manifest a sense of reality. Because it's non exclusive. Don't be so elusively blind. Things are never what they seem. You don't know what you'll find. Right now!    </segment5>
