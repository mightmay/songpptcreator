		<segment1>Fill me in, turn me inside out. Sometimes I feel like just letting go and screaming out loud</segment1>
		<segment2>Fill me up, sometimes it's so messed up. I feel like giving up but it's not far now</segment2>
		<segment3>But it feels so far away. Can't you pull me up and</segment3>
		<segment4>Make me a believer, let you down. For the first time come undone. If you let me, so don't put me down. And don't let this feeling slip away</segment4>
		<segment5>Let me in, these walls are closing in. Sick of these holes I'm in. Struck outside and looking back in</segment5>
		<segment6>Close me up, these hands have had enough. I feel like giving up, but it's not far now</segment6>
		<segment7>Away, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And tonight ignore me, ignore me. You know, I'm sorry, so sorry. And I'm sorry.     </segment7>
