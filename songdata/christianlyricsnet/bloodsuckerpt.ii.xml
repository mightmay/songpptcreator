		<segment1>
well, it's yours. you can have it if it means that much to you. don't let me stop you. don't let me stop you now</segment1>
		<segment2>stretch me out across the table. turn my insides out. turn me into someone else. someone more like yourself</segment2>
		<segment3>stretch me out. bother not with ties, I promise to lie perfectly still. I swear not to scream. at my becoming part of the machine</segment3>
		<segment4>let it be known that this is what you'll get. for falling out of line. no one wins against the machine. so get back in line</segment4>
		<segment5>are you the man now. that you got what you wanted. are you the man now. that you got it
