		<segment1>It came upon the midnight clear, That glorious song of old, From angels bending near the earth, To touch their harps of gold: &quot;Peace on the earth, goodwill to men. From heavens all gracious King!&quot;. The world in solemn stillness lay. To hear the angels sing.</segment1>
		<segment2>Yet with the woes of sin and strife. The world has suffered long;. Beneath the angel strain have rolled, Two thousand years of wrong. And man, at war with man, hears not, The love song which they bring;. O hush the noise, ye men of strife, And hear the angels sing. Hear the angels sing</segment2>
		<segment3>And ye beneath life's crushing load, Whose forms are bending low, Who toil along the climbing way. With painful steps and slow;. Look now, for glad and golden hours. Come swiftly on the wing;. Oh rest beside the weary road. And hear the angels sing. Hear the angels sing. Hear the angels sing. Hallelujah, Christ the Savior is born. Hallelujah, Christ the Savior is born. Hallelujah, Christ the Savior is born. Hallelujah, Christ the Savior is born    </segment3>
