		<segment1>In humble adoration. I kneel before Your throne. In brokenness I seek. Your face alone. Above You there's no other. Who's able to restore my soul. Come and make me whole</segment1>
		<segment2>Breathe on me. Power of God come in and change me. You are all I need. Holy Spirit breathe on me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm ready to surrender. To give You all my life. No matter what the cost or sacrifice. Reveal to me Your calling. Cleanse me from my prideful ways. Use me now I pray</segment3>
		<segment4>Breathe on me. Power of God come in and change me. You are all I need. Holy Spirit breathe on me</segment4>
		<segment5>I will say of the Lord. He is my strong tower. My rock and my fortress in whom I trust. In times of the storm and in tribulation. He is my help and my salvation</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh breath of God. Restore my soul</segment6>
		<segment7>I will say of the Lord. He is my strong tower. My rock and my fortress in whom I trust. In times of the storm and in tribulation. He is my help and my salvation</segment7>
		<segment8>Breathe on me. Power of God come in and change me. You are all I need. Holy Spirit breathe on me</segment8>
		<segment9>I need Thee how I need Thee. Every hour I need Thee. O Bless me now my Savior. I come to Thee    </segment9>
