		<segment1>What these years have brought me. What these years have taught me. Heartache and fame. A chance to change. A Hope to be stronger. That beauty can smolder. A stage and a curtain. That nothing's for certain. Oh these years have been hard on my bones. What this world has brought me. What this world has taught me. Senseless spinning. Never tie instead of winning. Ice cream for licking. The clock's always ticking. No one is free. Someone must have a key. Oh this world has been hard on my bones. All this time. I'd been seeking my own. Oh this road has been hard on my bones. What this love has brought me. What this love has taught me. Patience in battle. Who's in the saddle?. Joy and dispair. That I really do care. Uncertain desire. The risk going higher. Yeah this love has been hard on my bones. What this God has brought me. What this God has taught me. Passion and grace. How to stand in one space. Laughing at lillies. What truly fufils me. Death on a cross. It was I that was lost. Oh this God has been life to these bones. Oh this God has been life to my bones. Yes this God has been life to my bones    </segment1>
