		<segment1>Lord I'm tired. So tired from walking. And Lord I'm so alone. And Lord the dark. Is creeping in. Creeping up. To swallow me. I think I'll stop. Rest here a while</segment1>
		<segment2>And didn't You see me cry'n?. And didn't You hear me call Your name?. Wasn't it You I gave my heart to?. I wish You'd remember. Where you sat it down</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: And this is all that I can say right now. And this is all that I can give</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: I didn't notice You were standing here. I didn't know that. That was You holding me. I didn't notice You were cry'n too. I didn't know that. That was You washing my feet    </segment4>
