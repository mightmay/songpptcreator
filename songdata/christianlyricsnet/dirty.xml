		<segment1>tired of being clean, sick of being proper. I wanna live among the beggars. and dig out in the dirt. step outside the walls we built to protect us. don't be afraid to get some mud on your face</segment1>
		<segment2>come on, come on everybody. come on, come on and serve someone</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). let's get dirty, let's get used. no matter where you come from. if you're beaten up or bruised. let's get foolish - let's get free. free to be the one thing you were meant to be. let's get dirty</segment3>
		<segment4>you might get a bruise or some blisters on your fingers. you might start a question and wonder what it's worth. you may slip and fall from the burdens that you carry. but you can't have this treasure. 'til you dig it from the dirt</segment4>
		<segment5>come on, come on everybody. come on, come on and serve someone</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>come on, come on, everybody. come on, come on, serve somebody. come on, come on, everybody. come on, come on, serve somebody</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus x2)    </segment8>
