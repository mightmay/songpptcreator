		<segment1>I want you to know, Ive seen your wounded heart. Youre looking for hope, but it always feels so far. I want you to know that I made you who you are. And I cant wait for you to see what tomorrows gonna bring</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. A beautiful life is unfolding before my eyes. Just like the sun will rise to fill the empty sky, so shine. Oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful life</segment2>
		<segment3>I want you to see that youre the one I love. And I will complete the work that Ive begun. Oh, could you believe that the best is yet to come?. And I cant wait for you to hold what I already know</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]. Oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful life</segment4>
		<segment5>If you could see what I see, you were made to rise. If you could see what I see, you were made to shine</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]. Oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful, oh, your beautiful life    </segment6>
