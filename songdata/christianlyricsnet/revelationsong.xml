		<segment1>Worthy is the, Lamb who was slain. Holy holy is He. Sing a new song, to Him who sits on. Heaven's mercy seat</segment1>
		<segment2>Holy holy holy. Is the Lord God Almighty. Who was and is and is to come. With all creation I sing. Praise to the King of kings. You are my everything, and I will adore You</segment2>
		<segment3>Clothed in rainbows of living color. Flashes of lightning. Rolls of thunder. Blessing and honor. Strength and glory. And power be to You. The only wise King</segment3>
		<segment4>Filled with wonder, awestruck wonder. At the mention of Your name. Jesus Your name is power, breath and living water. Such a marvelous mystery     </segment4>
