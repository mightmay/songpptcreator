		<segment1>Thank you for the chance to live again. I will run always for you. Clouds had gathered all around my head. But these hands they lifted me. And I'll tell of this love that saved me</segment1>
		<segment2>Thank you for the chance to live again. I will run always for you. Walking closer you are all I have in this world only you. And I'll tell of this love that saved me</segment2>
		<segment3>And I'll wait for this light to break. I'll come to you, yes I'll run to you. And I'll wait for this light to break. I'll run to you, yes I'll come to you. I'll be one with you.     </segment3>
