		<segment1>What do you see in me, that I can bare your name, How do you justify, forgiving once again. If giving my all to you, is all you truly need. Then I give you everything, to work in spite of me. All that I have, at all costs, anything that I should gain, I count as loss, to know you, is all that I wanted. The past left behind, out of my way, Pressing on to what you have now granted me, Can this be, all that you wanted. When all the feelings pass, along with certainty, I cling to a faith that lasts, completely covering me.    </segment1>
