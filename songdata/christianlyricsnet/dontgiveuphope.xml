		<segment1>This world just keeps on getting crazier and crazier everyday, youre so afraid. Sometimes it feels like its chasing your sanity away. And you start to break, let me help you find your way. Dont give up faith, dont give up hope. Theres always something better, waiting around the corner. Dont give up now, Please, dont let go. What can feel like ending could just be the beginning, dont give up hope. Your life is spinning like a rocket thats gone out of control. And youve let go, youre slowly losing your confidence. Youre a wounded soul but I hope you know. I can help you find your way, dont turn around, keep on moving, find your faith. And youll be doing alright now. Dont look back, keep on moving, find your faith. And youll be doing alright now    </segment1>
