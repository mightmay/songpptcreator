		<segment1>How far have I driven myself. from that security I once tasted?. I thought I was so much closer. to grasping certainty. Waiting for what I've seen to. be taken away from me. Inside I hide alone and undefined. A fear breeds as I'm not. received leaving a lack of trust. While wanting and wishing for. a hand of purity to hold</segment1>
		<segment2>As you are always pushing me. you are always pushing me. We're just wasted prayers without. holding onto your embrace. and realizing life is worth living. Accepting acceptance. Time after time these wounds. stand to breath again. Help me to stand higher. With hope for tomorrow and. confidence to live for today    </segment2>
