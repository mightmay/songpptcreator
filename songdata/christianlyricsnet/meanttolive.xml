		<segment1>Fumbling his confidence. And wondering why the world has passed him by. Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments, And failed attempts to fly, fly</segment1>
		<segment2>We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves?. Somewhere we live inside. Somewhere we live inside. We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves?. Somewhere we live inside</segment2>
		<segment3>Dreaming about Providence. And whether mice or men have second tries. Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open. Maybe we're bent and broken, broken</segment3>
		<segment4>We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves?. Somewhere we live inside. Somewhere we live inside. We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves?. Somewhere we live inside</segment4>
		<segment5>We want more than this world's got to offer. We want more than this world's got to offer. We want more than the wars of our fathers. And everything inside screams for second life</segment5>
		<segment6>We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves?. We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves?. We were meant to live for so much more. Have we lost ourselves?. We were meant to live. We were meant to live.     </segment6>
