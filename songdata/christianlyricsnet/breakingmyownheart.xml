		<segment1>Left To My Ambitions I Find Myself Feeling. Short Of Breath And Losing Hope Again </segment1>
		<segment2>When Will I Be Free. When Will I Feel Alive. I Am At My End And I Can't Breath </segment2>
		<segment3>I Can't Breathe Everything I Do Is Useless. I Can't Do This On My Own I'm Fading. Too Many Times I've Left In Silence. This Time I Won't Give Up So Soon </segment3>
		<segment4>Crying Out For Some Relief. I Keep.     </segment4>
