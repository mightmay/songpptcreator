		<segment1>Have you always been the same my friend. You don't have to be alone and lonely my friend. Will you always be the same my friend. I'm wondering, i wonder will you see..</segment1>
		<segment2>On this, an ordinary day. There's an extraordinary Savior. Waiting, wanting you to know Him. On this, an ordinary day</segment2>
		<segment3>Do you even recognize your need. How can you build an argument from nothing my friend. Can you feel Him plant the seed my friend. Its happening, i wonder will you see..</segment3>
		<segment4>On this, an ordinary day. There's an extraordinary Savior. Waiting, wanting you to know Him. On this, an ordinary day. Creation's author waits for. You who happened to need Him. More than He needs you. On this, an ordinary day</segment4>
		<segment5>It was an ordinary day. When He died once for all. And He'll still be the same    </segment5>
