		<segment1>Though the treasures of. This life may fade. Your love endures forever. They will pass away Things that man has made. But your love endures forever</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I can't explain, or even understand. Why you gave your life, to save sinful man. But I know it's true, I've seen it myself. Your love endures forever</segment2>
		<segment3>Though the seasons change With the passing time. Your love endures forever. And the sun will fade If just for the night. Your love endures forever</segment3>
		<segment4>Though our pains and joys Will come and go. Your love endures forever. Even in my fears I will always know. That your love endures forever..    </segment4>
