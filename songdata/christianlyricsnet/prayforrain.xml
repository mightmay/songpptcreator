		<segment1>Born in a dry season. Wind and sand have blown through me. Haven't found shade anywhere. Only moments of relief. But sometimes I think I hear the thunder. Somewhere on the horizon line. If i could just find a way to get under. The rain that can reach this soul of mine</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I pray for rain to come. And wash away what's made me numb. I pray for a ragging storm. To drown what's in me. And the rain comes in the nick of time. I swallow hard cause my throat's been dry. The rain comes beating on my skin. Till I'm washed away - nothing left within. When the rain comes. Your rain comes</segment2>
		<segment3>Seasons have passed so quickly. Since I felt that first big storm. Still there have been times of drought. When i've prayed for the clouds to form. And I often hear the thunder. And I know of its coming rain. Many times in my life I'll kneel under. The moving showers that brought this change</segment3>
