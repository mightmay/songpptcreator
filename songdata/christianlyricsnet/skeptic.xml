		<segment1>Keep my pair of senses. Out of where it isn't clear. Kept his false creation. Teach on my own faith. Right I'll wreck this, too. But you made by day. I'll fail you, too. Speak through this voice, and. We can have life to take. And mend these ways</segment1>
		<segment2>We don't need tradition. This will wreck our mission. This isn't even clear. It doesn't tell they why. This is an incomplete. It doesn't tell the why. Even if I was all knowing. Wouldn't it mean that I love you?</segment2>
		<segment3>See you move against ignorance. Why not try and get in. This isn't even clear. It doesn't tell the why. This is an incomplete. It doesn't tell the why. Set out a boom and line. What have scholars caught. Look to yourself to find a God.</segment3>
		<segment4>No, a lie, and. We can have life to take, And mend these ways. We don't need tradition, This will wreck our mission. This isn't even clear. It doesn't tell the why. This is an incomplete. It doesn't tell the why    </segment4>
