		<segment1>A simple defect from decay. Unraveled words are left to fray. And to avoid. If you swallow all your pride. You would choke on every word. That you hide behind. So face yourself. And bury those useless words. That mean nothing to me. Your bitterness will bury you. Faster than your words ever could. You've taken arms against yourself. This is the end. I answer to it you fake    </segment1>
