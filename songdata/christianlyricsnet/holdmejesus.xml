		<segment1>Sometimes my life just don't. Make sense at all. When the mountains look. So big, and my faith. Jut seems so small. And I wake up in the night. And feel the dark. It's so hot inside my soul. There must be blisters. On my heart </segment1>
		<segment2>Hold me Jesus. I'm shaking like a leaf. You have been King of my glory. Won't You be my Prince of Peace. Hold me Jesus. Cause I'm shaking like a leaf. You have been King of my glory. Won't you be my Prince of Peace </segment2>
		<segment3>(repeat 1st verse) </segment3>
		<segment4>Surrender don't come naturally to me. I'd rather fight you for something. I don't really want, than. Take what you give that I need. Surrender don't come naturally to me. And I beat my head against so many walls. Now I'm falling down, I'm falling on my knees </segment4>
		<segment5>Saying hold me Jesus. Please hold me Jesus </segment5>
		<segment6>Hold me Jesus. I'm shaking like a leaf. You have been King of my glory. Won't you be my Prince of Peace. Hold me Jesus. Cause I'm shaking like a leaf. You have been King of my glory. Won't you be my Prince of Peace </segment6>
		<segment7>My Prince of Peace (3X). Hold me Jesus (4X)    </segment7>
