		<segment1>I've been walking around with my heart in my hand. I might ask you if you could ever understand. I can't take another break in my heart. So let me show you darling where to start</segment1>
		<segment2>You think you know how to love me. But I think you might go and tear me apart. You think you know how to show me. But I could use a few less breaks in my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>If there ever was a big mistake I made. I'm still broke from all the prices that I paid. I can't bring myself to linger in the past. I need something that I know is gonna last</segment3>
		<segment4>You think you know how to love me. But I think you might go and tear me apart. You think you know how to show me. But I could use a few less breaks in my heart    </segment4>
