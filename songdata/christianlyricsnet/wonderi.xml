		<segment1>Step into the window/ What about the sun?. Follow me outside/ When rain's are coming down?. I don't have the reasons/ Can we chase the wind?. If we feel inclined</segment1>
		<segment2>Wonder, wonder I. If I stood on your shoulders, could I touch the sky?. When will you die?. Where will you go?. Wonder, wonder I</segment2>
		<segment3>Sister cast a shadow/ Brother tell me why. You're holding back the sun/ No! It can't be done. We're towering to these spiders/ But I feel so small. It's alright/ Is it ok?. It's ok, I feel small too</segment3>
		<segment4>You and I standing here throwing pebbles in the water. As they fall watch the circles growing farther and farther. To no end like Daddy said, they carry on into Forever    </segment4>
