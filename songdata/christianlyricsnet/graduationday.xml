		<segment1>Today is the greatest day of our young lives. I look back at what I've known for so long. today is the day we leave our past behind. today we say our last goodbyes. memories in the back of my mind. held close by until the day that I die. good luck my friends make it to the end. I wish you all the best until we meet again. i can't believe it seems like yesterday. just kids and now it's time to grow up. that thought makes me feel sick now I want to cry. seperated for the rest of our lives. I don't know why it turned out this way. we always thought things would work out OK. now I see everybody telling me what I must be. when all I want to do is go back in time with you. today is the saddest day of our young lives. today we go our separate ways. the sky's the limit for each one of us. make good with everything you've got    </segment1>
