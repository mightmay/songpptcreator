		<segment1>There's a slow train. Pulling through the desert. The colored cars pass quietly from sight. Between the highway and the long horizon. Precious dreams wind away with the light. </segment1>
		<segment2>My brother's and my sisters' faces linger. The hours of our childhood, grave and gold. Driving through these solitary places. Memories of their gentile kinship. Touch my soul </segment2>
		<segment3>The hawk wheels away as we pass here. The clouds billow up and fly on. Down the road some hard turns. Are going to shake us. Ride with us. Through the breaking of the dawn </segment3>
		<segment4>Worry for my loving mother. The dimming years, The trials she has known. Her heart so kind and so weary. Keep her safe one more night. 'til I get home </segment4>
		<segment5>How I long to be right there beside her. And bring everything back to before. We'll arrive with the first light of morning. Keep her safe, let me hold her once more </segment5>
		<segment6>The sage and Joshua tree remind me. Of the miles to go, The journey that we're on. In the still, sweet air of the desert. We will ride. Through the breaking of the dawn    </segment6>
