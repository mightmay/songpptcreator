		<segment1>Rich young man, you think you can. Make it through the world on the things you've got. I'll tell you, I know it's true. You can't get to heaven on things you've bought. They're going to leave you. They're going to fade away</segment1>
		<segment2>What good is it a man. to gain the whole world. And forfeit his soul. What good is it a man. To gain the whole world. And forfeit his soul</segment2>
		<segment3>Poor old soul, he got more. Than the kings of a thousand countries. What he owns ain't silver or gold. This boy is bound for glory</segment3>
		<segment4>He's going to leave us. He's going to fly away    </segment4>
