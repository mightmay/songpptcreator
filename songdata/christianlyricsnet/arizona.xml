		<segment1>can we drive faster. i know that leaves are turning. so we change courses. it feels like home. although we travel. pull over and pose for a picture. at each state line. smile if you want to. can you breathe in warm air. the windows are rolled down. this long road far ahead. we see why. take the time to drive. through arizona because we've got fuel. to last us all day long.     </segment1>
