		<segment1>Let us die, let us die. Dying we reply. &quot;don't talkto us about suffering, look in our eyes&quot;. Let us be, let us be-. Our closeness is such that. wherever she rests her head. in the softness underneath, she'll feel me - and you will feel me. </segment1>
		<segment2>Je leverai les yeux a toi-. J'ai change cent foi de nom. Je leverai les yeux a toi-. Je n'ai pas d'spoir. </segment2>
		<segment3>When you laugh you'll feel my breath there. filling up your lungs. And when you cry, those aren't your tears but I'm there. falling down your cheek. adn when you say you love him, taste me. I'm like poison on your tongue-. But when you're tired, if you're quiet, you'll hear me singing you to sleep.     </segment3>
