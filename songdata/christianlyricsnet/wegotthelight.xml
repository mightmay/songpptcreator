		<segment1>Everybodys got something they are trying to overcome. Everybodys got a secret they have swept underneath the rug. Everybody has spoken a lie behind a brother. Looking for a splinter in the eye of another. You dont ever have to feel alone. Together are on this road.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: We got the light that never fades. Were gonna make it through today. Hold on, hold on. We got the heart that brings the hope. We got the key to free your soul. Hold on, hold on.</segment2>
		<segment3>Everybody is looking for love and looking for a meaning. Everybody is searching for reasons to keep believing. And everybody is hanging on tryin to not let go. Just praying for the strength to carry this heavy load. You dont ever have to feel alone. Together we are on this road.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: We got the light that never fades. Were gonna make it through today. Hold on, hold on. We got the heart that brings the hope. We got the key to free your soul. Hold on, hold on.</segment4>
		<segment5>Its taking us over tonight. Were handing you over our lives. Its taking us over tonight. Were handing you over our lives. Yeah </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus:]. We got the heart, we got the hope, Weve got the key, youve got the soul. Weve got the love coming from above. Gotta give it away to everyone.</segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus:]. We got the heart that brings the hope. We got the key to free your soul. Hold on, hold on.    </segment7>
