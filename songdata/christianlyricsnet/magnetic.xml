		<segment1>How do we explain the source of life. That runs within these veins and keeps my heart in time?. You are the music, and I'm drawn in. Caught in the movement, I'm letting go, I can't resist</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause You're magnetic. I can't help it, I'm stuck on You. There's something magic in the way that You love me. I'm stuck on You</segment2>
		<segment3>I know I have the freedom to decide. You don't make me love You. I just can't deny the force of gravity. And You are the ground that keeps me standing here with You</segment3>
		<segment4>You're magnetic, I can't help it. I'm letting go of all control. Can't deny it, I won't fight it. No matter what I do, I'm drawn to You.     </segment4>
