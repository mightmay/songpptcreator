		<segment1>Can you feel the beat of a thousand marching feet. Searching for passion in a lifeless dead-end street. They're breaking down the wall. They're knocking at the door. Searching for a soul that gives them more. When the music dies, the apparations of melody will rise. All that's said and done, will haunts us one by one. The spirit of the heart will carry on. Are you listening to the voices as they scream. calling to the masses with the drone of sleepless dreams. They're coming to your house. They're crawling up the stairs. Searching for a saint who really cares. It's just below the skin, that is starts sinking in    </segment1>
