		<segment1>I cover my heart. Turn from the wind. Button my coat. Here comes the storm again. What can I do but to trust in Him </segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause I know the deeper my faith runs. The stronger I become. And the thunder, it may shake me. But I always know that</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: After the rain. You can look to the sky again. The clouds will give way. To the light of the sun. After the rain. You know that you've made it through. And you'll finally see the joy from the pain. After the rain </segment3>
		<segment4>Everyone needs. Everyone hurts. Everyone feels. The weight of the world sometimes. But don't let the wind sweep your heart away </segment4>
		<segment5>'Cause even the roughest waters cleanse. So when they come again. Let them serve as a reminder. You can always know that</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS </segment6>
		<segment7>Can't you see the hand of Jesus. Reaching out for you. You never have to face the storm alone    </segment7>
