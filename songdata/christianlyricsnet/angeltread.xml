		<segment1>Crickets rhythmically sing. Their mournful melodies. A monotone by request. But they fail, they fail. To soothe the mess</segment1>
		<segment2>Hands rhythmically grope. The sheets again for you. And off-rhythm the time slows. To make moments eternal. Moments eternal</segment2>
		<segment3>Is this some kind of holy test. To stitch the treadmarks off my chest. To get up and walk outside my head. On a holy search for angeltread</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I've lost my fear. So I pray that you come near. With a million sparkly lights. And help me, help me through the night</segment4>
		<segment5>The milky prints of spirits near. I pray that they have lost their fear. A million wisps of sparkly light. Weaving through the walls..    </segment5>
