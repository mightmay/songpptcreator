		<segment1>
thumbs out on a desert road I am told . leads to nowhere . any shade is as good as the next . if your shadow doesn't go there . week seven: Did you really asume . I'd find some solace from the letter in your room? . next life, could you kindly refain . from throwing yourself at the mercy of a train? </segment1>
		<segment2>silence all, nobody breathe . how in the world could you just leave? . you promised you would . silence that evil with good </segment2>
		<segment3>hear me out, I have the flooe . I'll give you my tears, I'll listen more . you promised you would . overcome evil with good </segment3>
		<segment4>maybe this world is a barren place for a soul . prone to get lost . but heaven still hounds from the smallest sounds . to the cries of the storm-tosed . week nine: I am writing in the sand . any little clue that could help me understand . every whispered secret, every muffled sigh . every half-truth that was added to a lie </segment4>
		<segment5>silence all, nobody move . I've got to know now what you hoped to prove . you promised you would . silence that evil with good </segment5>
		<segment6>shame feeds guilt, guilt needs release . you took it to God . you made your peace . and swore that you would . overcome evil with good </segment6>
		<segment7>every old demon playing back the crime . if they needed blood, I'd have gladly given mine . a Child of the Kingdom; still an invalid . forgive her, please Father . she don't know what she did </segment7>
		<segment8>silence all, now go to sleep . the water's free, the well is deep . how can we return . that which we never could earn? </segment8>
		<segment9>God, I long to see her face . we haven't a hope . beyond Your grace . I know that You will . overcome evil . for good
    </segment9>
