		<segment1>Lord, how lovely is Your name. You are everyday the same. You are worthy. Lord, come and fill our emptiness. With the beauty of Your holiness. Now, we will sing Your praise. And declare Your ways to be holy</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Lord, we love and proclaim. The Holiest name. Of God in the highest. Lord, above every name. No other can claim. The Holiest name of all</segment2>
		<segment3>Grace has been given unto us. We have nothing else to trust. But Your mercy. Your love has called us to Your side. We will faithfully abide in You. And now we will heed Your voice. And our hearts rejoice in Your glory</segment3>
