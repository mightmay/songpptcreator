		<segment1>Watch your makeup, There is just a smudge beneath the eye. You look great in that dress, It hits every curve just right. We've got dinner at eight, and then drinks by nine. I love you so, it's our anniversary tonight.</segment1>
		<segment2>Suddenly everything shakes as if it's starting to break. And now I'm on my knees, My wife screams, &quot;What's Wrong!?&quot;. As the stereo plays our song, Only in Dreams.</segment2>
		<segment3>Just last Friday is when my heart failed again. I was thinking that I should find a friend, I bought her several drinks, And slipped the ring into my hand. We drove to her place. And let the good times roll again.</segment3>
		<segment4>Suddenly everything shakes as my protection breaks. And now I'm on my knees, And I scream, &quot;This was wrong!&quot;. As I leave, the stereo plays the song, The Finishing.</segment4>
		<segment5>Is this it? Is this how I have spent my life?. Lying there with a broken heart on bedroom floors. And finally, finally I realize, I realize I'm only a man.</segment5>
		<segment6>One thing I have to know, where did the miracles go?. And if a simple man believes, Will it start again with me?</segment6>
		<segment7>If I were the maker I would fashion out a blade. To cut out every inch of dead heart I've made.    </segment7>
