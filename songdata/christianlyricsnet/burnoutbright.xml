		<segment1>Does it have to start with a broken heart. Broken dreams and bleeding parts. We were young and world was clear. Young ambition disappears. I swore it would never come to this. The average, the obvious</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm still discontented down here. I'm so discontented</segment2>
		<segment3>If we only got one try. If we've only got one life. If time was never on our side. Before I die I want to burn out bright</segment3>
		<segment4>So a spark ignites. In time and space. To make it through this human race. You fight and crawl your way back home. But you're running the wrong way</segment4>
		<segment5>The future is a question mark. With kerosene electric sparks. There's still fire in you yet. Yeah there's still fire in you</segment5>
		<segment6>If we only got one try. If we've only got one life. If time was never on our side. Before I die I want to burn out bright</segment6>
		<segment7>I can't clean up the mess I've made. I can't clean up the mess I've made</segment7>
		<segment8>Can't sleep in the bed I've made. Can't sleep in the bed I've made</segment8>
		<segment9>If we only got one try. If we've only got one life. If time was never on our side. Before I die I want to burn out bright    </segment9>
