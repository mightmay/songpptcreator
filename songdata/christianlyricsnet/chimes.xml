		<segment1>I hear a voice speaking softly amidst the breathing. An invitation to a place where hearts are breathing. To a place where your dreams are made. Where songs are played. Where drinking never ceases and no dismay. I'm pushing my senses away to take another step. With my concience aware of my heart's intent. I feel a whisper, a friendly voice start to rise. &quot;Indulge until your heart's content and pay no mind. Tomorrow is a lifetime away and this is here. The time is now, so there's nothing to fear.&quot;. This hint of disaster is a beautiful face. Hiding grins, fronting the chills of warm embrace</segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;I'll take you to a place where chimes are ringing. To a place with a chill where souls are singing. I'll bring you to a state of nightmares clinging. Where your innocence dies with lies I'm bringing&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll take you to a place lying six feet below. Where bodies lie cowering soft and slow. And where the song of the chimes keeps ringing. And outside the window the demons are singing. I see the faces aware but the room is empty. And now I'm owned by my lifeless stare. My shelves are bare. I'm dreaming about a second chance to go back. Rewind the clock and attempt a playback</segment3>
		<segment4>&quot;Follow me to pain and I'll show you&quot;    </segment4>
