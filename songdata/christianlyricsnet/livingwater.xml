		<segment1>I feel your touch, I can feel your heart. As I'm lying here alone in the dark. I hear your voice gently say &quot;come to me. I long for your love as the earth longs for the rainfall. Im weary Lord Ive wondered this dessert too long </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. So come Living Water flow through me like a river. My hearts been thirsting so long. Flood through my soul and pour out your mercy. Come Living Water fill me</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord so many times youve called my name. And Ive turned my face the other way. Yet before I even saw the womb you love me. How can I be so blind when I alone have created my darkness. Forgive me Lord and wash me clean again    </segment3>
