		<segment1>Forgive me if I stare. But I am taken back. That You would let me here. Regardless of my past. Oh my hands are shaking now. But I catch my breathe somehow. Oh, I am free at last</segment1>
		<segment2>Unaware of my fears. Unaware of my shame. Nothing else matters here. But glorifying Your name. Unaware of everything. Knowing You're aware of me</segment2>
		<segment3>Tell me how I got here. I couldn't make it on my own. Just tell me I can stay. Cause it feels so much like home. And I lose all track of time. When I look into Your eyes. Your love is all I know</segment3>
		<segment4>Unaware of my fears. Unaware of my shame. Nothing else matters here. But glorifying Your name. Unaware of everything. Knowing You're aware of me</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm aware I'm in a place I couldn't be. If You weren't there to call my name and rescue me</segment5>
		<segment6>Unaware of my fears. Unaware of my shame. Nothing else matters here. But glorifying Your name</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm unaware of all my fears. And I'm unaware of all my shame. Nothing else matters here. But glorifying Your name</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm unaware that I still breathe. Unaware of everything. Knowing You're aware of me    </segment8>
