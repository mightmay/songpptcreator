		<segment1>Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the biggest fool of all?. You don't have to answer me. 'Cause when I look at you I see. A prisoner set free from his chains. Acting like he's still a slave. To the prison he's been set free from. You may say its only natural for me to act this. Well, I know its only natural. But I have not been made</segment1>
		<segment2>Only natural, only natural. I've got the Spirit of the living God alive in me. Giving me power so I don't have to be. Only natural, only natural</segment2>
		<segment3>So mirror, mirror, look again. You've seen the fool that I have been. But did you see the grace that covers me. Not to do anything I please. In fact, grace is the only thing. That makes me what I am not naturally. It's supernatural power brings life out of the grave. It gives sight to the blind man, and it will not let me stay</segment3>
		<segment4>Only natural, only natural. I've got the Spirit of the living God alive in me. Giving me power so I don't have to be. Only natural, only natural</segment4>
		<segment5>I know that on my own, I'm only human naturally. But I've got the Spirit of the living God alive in me. Giving me power so I don't have to be</segment5>
		<segment6>Only natural, only natural.     </segment6>
