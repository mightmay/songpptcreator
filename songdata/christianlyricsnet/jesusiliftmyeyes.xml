		<segment1>When sins and fears prevailing rise. And fainting hope almost expires. Jesus to Thee I lift my eyes. To Thee I breathe my soul's desires. Are you not mine, my living Lord. And can my hope, my comfort die. Fixed on the everlasting word. That word which built the earth and sky</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, I lift my eyes. To Thee I breathe my soul's desires. Jesus, I lift my eyes. To Thee I lift my eyes</segment2>
		<segment3>Here let my faith unshaken dwell. Immovable the promise stands. Not all the powers of earth or hell. Can e're dissolve the sacred bands</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus, I lift my eyes. To Thee I breathe my soul's desires. Jesus, I lift my eyes. To Thee I lift my eyes</segment4>
		<segment5>Here oh my soul. Thy trust repose. If Jesus is forever mine. Not death itself that last of foes. Can break a union so divine</segment5>
		<segment6>Jesus, I lift my eyes. To Thee I breathe my soul's desires. Jesus, I lift my eyes. To Thee I breathe my soul's desires    </segment6>
