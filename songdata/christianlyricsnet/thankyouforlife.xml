		<segment1>You have captured me. More than life itself You've moved me. How I long to bow. At the feet of the One who saves me</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus, thank You for the Cross. Savior, the One who sets me free. Jesus, thank You for Your blood. Jesus, Jesus, thank You for life. Thank you for life</segment2>
		<segment3>You stole Heaven's heart. In your pain You pleased Your father. Angels stood in awe. While You carried the shame for me</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh Jesus, thank You for the Cross. Savior, the One who sets me free. Jesus, thank You for Your blood. Jesus, Jesus, thank You for life</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, there's nothing great that You haven't done. Than to lose Your life to gain my soul. There is nothing that compares to this. No, nothing, no, nothing</segment5>
		<segment6>Jesus, Savior, Redeemer. Thank You for the life, oh..</segment6>
		<segment7>Jesus, thank You for the Cross. Savior, the One who sets me free. Jesus, thank You for Your blood. Jesus, Jesus, thank You for life, oh..</segment7>
		<segment8>Jesus, thank You for the Cross. Savior, the One who sets me free. Jesus, thank You for Your blood. Jesus, Jesus, thank You for life. Thank You for life.     </segment8>
