		<segment1>Did I really need her. Was it just a sweet dream. Lingers in the morning. Like a melody. Over and over all through the day. I can't stop thinking about how I'm feeling this way. Chorus: She moves like sea breeze, swirling around me. The fragrance that she leaves hangs in the air. Soft like a whisper, she's calling me to her. These eyes have seen the most beautiful dream. We found each other, staring at the waves. Started talkin' couldn't break away. And made plans to meet tonight. Down by the pier, when midnight strikes I'm going to hold that dream near. (Chorus). Tomorrow, surprise o'er. She took my heart with one look in her eye. To a place that feels like home. (Chorus 2x). These eyes have seem the most beautiful dream. Oh, oh    </segment1>
