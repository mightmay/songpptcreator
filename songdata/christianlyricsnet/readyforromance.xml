		<segment1> I used to think that love was just a sentiment for people with a lot of emotion. Right up until I turned twenty three. I've been thinking about these people buying tickets. Just to see their honey across the ocean. When I could just stay right here for free</segment1>
		<segment2>A combination of alone and alive just came right over me. And this picture of you came into view. And you set the wild heart free</segment2>
		<segment3>I showed my independence to the door. Took off my shoes and slid across the floor. And then I watched When Harry Met Sally once more. I'm lost without you. I never stood chance. I'm tired of freedom. I'm ready for romance</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm skipping all that pre-relation preparation. Take it one step at a heart ache. Just give me some room and let her fly. I'll search every little town up and down the heartlands full of prosperity. Without any rest till she's next to me</segment4>
		<segment5>A combination of alone and alive just came right over me. And this picture of you came into view. And you set this wild heart free</segment5>
		<segment6>Let's show our independence to the door. Took off our shoes and slide across the floor. And we can watch When Harry Met Sally once more. I'm lost without you. I never stood chance. I'm tired of freedom. I'm ready for romance    </segment6>
