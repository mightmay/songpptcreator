		<segment1>Don't know what he sees in me. He is spirit, he is free. And I, the wife of adultery. Gomer is my name. Simply more than I can see. How he keeps on forgiving me;. How he keeps his sanity. Hosea, you're a fool.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: A fool to love someone like me, A fool to suffer silently;. Though sometimes through your eyes I see. I'd rather be a fool.</segment2>
		<segment3>The fondness of a father, The passion of a child;. The tenderness of a loving friend. An understanding smile. All of this and so much more, You've lavished on a faithless whore. I've never known love like this before. Hosea, you're a fool.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: A fool to love someone like me, A fool to suffer silently;. Though sometimes through your eyes I see. I'd rather be a fool.</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: This God of yours would not have told. To lift a love that you couldn't hold;. And though time and time again I flee, I'm always glad to see you coming after me!</segment5>
		<segment6>Simply more than I can see, How he keeps on forgiving me. The wife of adultery;. Gomer is my name.    </segment6>
