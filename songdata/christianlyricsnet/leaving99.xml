		<segment1>I'm lost and broken all alone on this road. The wheels keep turning but the feeling is gone. when I fear I'm on my own. You remind me i am not alone</segment1>
		<segment2>You say.</segment2>
		<segment3>I'd leave ninety-nine. Leave them all behind. To find you. (For you alone) I'd leave ninety-nine. Leave them all behind. To find you</segment3>
		<segment4>It's dark and lonely and the path is unclear. Can't move my feet because I'm frozen with fear. And you say, my child, my child. i am always here, i'm at your side</segment4>
		<segment5>I'd leave ninety-nine. Leave them all behind. To find you. (For you alone) I'd leave ninety-nine. Leave them all behind. To find you</segment5>
		<segment6>you're never too far down. I promise you'll be found, i'll reach into the mud, miry clay. pursue you to the end, like a faithful friend, nothing in this world, will keep me away,</segment6>
		<segment7>I'd leave ninety-nine. Leave them all behind. To find you. (For you alone) I'd leave ninety-nine. Leave them all behind. To find you.. to find you..     </segment7>
