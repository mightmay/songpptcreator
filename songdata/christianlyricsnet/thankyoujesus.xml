		<segment1>When I think about and remember how. There was no way out and You rescued me. There's no reason why. You loved me then and You love me now. Least, no reason I can see</segment1>
		<segment2>You had always been my closest friend. Even though I'd never defended that. I was so far away. As far as ever I could stray. But You were there to bring me back</segment2>
		<segment3>Thank You Jesus. For the grace that You have given us. We could never repay. But from my heart I'd like to say. That I thank You</segment3>
		<segment4>There's so much to learn about how to turn. All Your words of life that burn in me. Into a living fountain. Flowing deep and flowing clean. So that all can come and drink</segment4>
		<segment5>But I know you're right there. Willing to prepare. This open heart of mine to carry on. To the place where I can be. Your servant, be Your friend. One that You can depend on</segment5>
