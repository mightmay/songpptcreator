		<segment1>tonight's perfect i feel like movin around. to the kick kick, kick on in. it's been a long time walking in a straight line. let's get away you know we gotta get away. we'll find the open skies that open up our eyes. far from city lights let the night shine. throw an old record on play your favorite song. might be our only chance (trance)</segment1>
		<segment2>dance when you're feelin it move. when you're feelin this grove. when you know that you just can't take it. dance with all that you've got. cause it's all that we're not. we will find that we just can't fake it, dance</segment2>
		<segment3>still got this nervous feeling. it's got that energy, the kind that moves me. theres a glow in the air from the power lines. there's a whole lot of life in the bonfire. going outside the walls falling into the charm. i wanna dance i wanna dance through the night. come come come come on come on wo ho. come come come come on come on and dance</segment3>
		<segment4>one day we will be together standing near the sunshine.     </segment4>
