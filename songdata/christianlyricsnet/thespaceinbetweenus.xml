		<segment1>Look at my heart again. Look at the mess I've got it in. I'm trying to trust in You. To know that you'll see me through. Through my pride. Through my shame. Into Your love. Into Your grace. I'm not looking back. Till I see Your face. And I'm running straight to You. Because</segment1>
		<segment2>All I really want to do is to fall into. The emptiness that is. The space in-between us. To break this division. All I really want to do is to fall into. The emptiness that is. The space in-between us. Erase it and bring us together again</segment2>
		<segment3>My life's like an open book. Nothing is hidden when you look. You break through my boundaries. Revealing my insecurities. But through my pride. And through my shame. You show me love. You show me grace. I'm not looking back. Till I see your face. And I'm running straight to you. Because</segment3>
		<segment4>Here I am saying I need you. I know I need you. Here I am, I'm coming to meet you. Cause I want to see you    </segment4>
