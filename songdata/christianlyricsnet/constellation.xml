		<segment1>Some things can never be explained. Why every sky still looks the same. And I wonder how my world would look without you</segment1>
		<segment2>Some things can never be explained. Like how our skies remain the same. And I wonder how the sky would look without my star. Sleep seems a dream away and a year too late. Words that cant be spoken stream out my face</segment2>
		<segment3>And I want to be selfish. I want to be selfish. I want to be selfish, youre my everything</segment3>
		<segment4>Some things can never be explained. Why does your love remain unchanged?. Cause I know it wouldnt be the same without you</segment4>
		<segment5>Sleep seems a dream away and a year too late. Words that cant be spoken stream out your face. And I want to be selfish. I want to be selfish. I want to be selfish, youre my everything</segment5>
		<segment6>Please dont forget my name. And take me with you when you leave. Ive got a lot to lose. Ive got to let it go</segment6>
