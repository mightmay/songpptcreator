		<segment1>I am nothing without. his ghost within. and all your wooden eyes cannot see. the good hand upon me</segment1>
		<segment2>I took my shelter neath a familyre tree. im livin where I come from. I am I am my fathers son. see the good hand. see what the good hand done</segment2>
		<segment3>leave it lye. let it go to ruin. to be blown thin by the wind. a heavy drone. a heavy sway. girl I love to see you talk that way</segment3>
		<segment4>I live. I live among them. and they breath forth fire. I run. I run fast and then. I do not tire. for the good hand upon me</segment4>
		<segment5>I see you've chosen to lose your way. to greed with a clank for nothin'. keep your word. captive in thought. you will give all. you will give all you've got. to the good hand upon me. she will understand. from the bottom of her heart. embellished by pains engraving. just how great thou art    </segment5>
