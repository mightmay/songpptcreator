		<segment1>I thought my world was complete. I was living a life made on shaky ground. I was blinded so I couldn't see. I couldn't stand I thought I was drowning. I thought I was sinking. I thought I was dying.</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I found forever in your arms. I know just right where I need to be. I found forever in your arms. I know just right where I feel free.</segment2>
		<segment3>Some nights I would lie all alone. Dreaming of You and the way things should be. You know, I had no chance on my own. But now I can make it with you next to me. Now we are together. Now I've found forever.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge)</segment5>
		<segment6>Some how you came. And took all my pain away. I know that I can't. Repay all the love You gave. All the love that you gave.</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus. Chorus.     </segment7>
