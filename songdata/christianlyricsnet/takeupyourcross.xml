		<segment1>Take up your cross! (crucified). TAKE UP YOUR CROSS!. I command your love for me. Salvation paved, God set you free. Come with me for eternity. Take up your cross and follow me. Gain the world, Gain the world. Loose your soul, Loose your soul. If you will come after me. Deny yourself obediantly. Take up your cross and follow me. For the gospel you'll be free. If you will come after me. Jesus Christ thy will be done. Saved for all eternity. Jesus Christ thy will be done. If you are ashamed of me, or my words. Before this sinful generation. I will be ashamed of you. Before my Father, and the angels. If you are ashamed of me I will be ashamed of you. Take up your cross    </segment1>
