		<segment1>When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry. And curse at the wind. He broke his own heart and I watched. As he tried to reassemble it</segment1>
		<segment2>And my momma swore that. She would never let herself forget. And that was the day that I promised. I'd never sing of love if it does not exist</segment2>
		<segment3>But darling, you are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception</segment3>
		<segment4>Maybe I know, somewhere deep in my soul. That love never lasts. And we've got to find other ways to make it alone. Or keep a straight face</segment4>
		<segment5>And I've always lived like this. Keeping a comfortable distance. And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness. Because none of it was ever worth the risk</segment5>
		<segment6>But you are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception</segment6>
		<segment7>I've got a tight grip on reality. But I can't let go of what's in front of me here. I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up. Leave me with some kind of proof, it's not a dream, oh</segment7>
		<segment8>You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception</segment8>
		<segment9>You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception. You are the only exception</segment9>
		<segment10>And I'm on my way to believing. Oh, and I'm on my way to believing    </segment10>
