		<segment1>I watch as the daylight crawls. past the shadows hanging on the walls. it's been a long time since I felt THE STAINS. OF yesterday getting in my way</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm alive but tell me am I free. I've got eyes but tell me can I see. the sky is falling and no one knows. we shouldn't be hard to believe. shouldn't be this difficult to breathe. the sky is falling and no one knows</segment2>
		<segment3>YOU leave me hanging on. I need to catch my breath. I've got you and I've got nothing left. don't leave me all alone down here. with myself and all of my fear</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm alive but tell me am I free. I've got eyes but tell me can I see. the sky is falling and no one knows. we shouldn't be hard to believe. shouldn't be this difficult to breathe. the sky is falling and no one knows. no one knows. no one knows</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm alive but tell me am I free. I've got eyes but tell me can I see. the sky is falling and no one knows. we shouldn't be hard to believe. shouldn't be this difficult to breath. the sky is falling and no one knows. the sky is falling and no one knows. the sky is falling and no one knows    </segment5>
