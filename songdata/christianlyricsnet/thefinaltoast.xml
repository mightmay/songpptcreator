		<segment1>Warwickshire to Fraserville and all between. You have left us here a life of memories. You forever changed the lives of all of us who have known you. Truth be told, this world feels cold without you. You gave all of us a better name. So here's the final toast we raise to you, dear friend. Good times will never be the same. And our thoughts still remain. We'll hold you in your hearts. Forever and a day. And we'll never be the same. So the last toast that we raise goes to you. So if you ever lost someone that's close to you. Waiting for the answers like the spring to bloom. I hope their tears are wiped away. When they're at the pearly gates praying for you. You have made this world a better place    </segment1>
