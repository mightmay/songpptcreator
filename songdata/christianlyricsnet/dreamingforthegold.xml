		<segment1>It was 10:00 when he lost his appetite. It was around 9:45 when his dream almost. Packed up and died. And as he drove away he could almost. Hear them say: &quot; If you think that you're the only one. Standing here then maybe it is time. For you to get your thing and get right out of here &quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>There was a lady who had a car 100 miles away. What was she doing there if it wasn't what. She wanted anyway. And as she drove away she could still hear him say: &quot; If you think that you're the only one. Hurting here then maybe, I'm not yours. And you shouldn't be mine. &quot;    </segment2>
