		<segment1>Dancing Dave is here again. And he somehow leaves me cold. And from my tower, my love grows sour. Â‘cause I'm his woman, you know?. He's in the spotlight, I said it's not right. To dance with all of your heart. The Lord is holy not rock and rolly. Least that's the way I was taught. Davey where's your etiquette?. Well, you're barely wearing your clothes. If you use a circus tent. You could even start up a show. You know it's not right, not very polite. You know you're fallin' apart yeah. You're bein' ornery but more importantly. Get out of the way of the ark!. I saw you jumpin' and gettin' down. But I'm here to tell you I'll have no part. I'm not the kind of queen that dances around. Like a bad girl in a bar. You know it's not right, it isn't godlike. To dance with all of your heart. You need my loyalty, might lose your royalty. Unless you make a new start. But Dancing Dave was innocent. And as some of you may know. His wife Michal was to wind up childless. Because she wounded him so. I said it's all right; he had some more wives. But there's a point to this part yeah. So read the manual in Second Samuel. In chapter six you should start!</segment1>
