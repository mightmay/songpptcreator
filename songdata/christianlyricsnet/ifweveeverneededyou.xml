		<segment1>Hear our cry, Lord, we pray. Our faces down, our hands are raised. You called us out, we turned away. We've turned away</segment1>
		<segment2>With shipwrecked faith the idols rise. We do what is right in our own eyes. Our children now will pay the price. We need Your light, Lord, shine Your light</segment2>
		<segment3>If we've ever needed You. Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now. We are desperate for Your hand. We're reaching out, we're reaching out</segment3>
		<segment4>All our hearts, all our strength. With all our minds, we're at Your feet. May Your kingdom come in our hearts and lives. Let Your church arise, let Your church arise</segment4>
		<segment5>If we've ever needed You. Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now. We are desperate for Your hand. We're reaching out, we're reaching out. We're reaching out</segment5>
		<segment6>If we've ever needed You. Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now. We are desperate for Your hand. We're reaching out, we're reaching out</segment6>
		<segment7>If we've ever needed You. Lord, it's now, Lord, it's now. We are desperate for Your hand. We're reaching out, reaching out</segment7>
		<segment8>We need You now. Revive us now. We need You now</segment8>
