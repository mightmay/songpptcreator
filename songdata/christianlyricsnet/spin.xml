		<segment1>Why would I chase your shadow all my life. And be afraid of my own?. I'd rather be with you. I'd rather not know. Where I'll be than. Be alone and convinced that I know</segment1>
		<segment2>When the world keeps spinning round. My world's upside down. You and I wouldn't change a thing. I've got nothing else to lose. I lost it all when I found you. And I wouldn't change a thing. No, you and I wouldn't change a thing</segment2>
		<segment3>Everything I know has let me down. So I will just let go. Let you turn me inside out. Cause I know I'm not sure. about anything. But you wouldn't have it any other way</segment3>
		<segment4>When the world keeps spinning round. My world's upside down. You and I wouldn't change a thing. I've got nothing else to lose. I lost it all when I found you. And I wouldn't change a thing. No, you and I wouldn't change a thing</segment4>
		<segment5>Spinning turning watching burning. All my life has found its meaning. Walking crawling climbing falling. All my life has found its meaning</segment5>
		<segment6>You and I wouldn't change a thing. No, you and I wouldn't change a thing</segment6>
		<segment7>When the world keeps spinning round. My world's upside down. You and I wouldn't change a thing. I've got nothing else to lose. I lost it all when I found you. And I wouldn't change a thing. No, you and I wouldn't change a thing</segment7>
		<segment8>No, you and I wouldn't change a thing    </segment8>
