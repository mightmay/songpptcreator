		<segment1>This is my heart's cry. I want to know the one who saved me and gave me life. This is my heart's cry to be so close to Him that all my life becomes. A testimony of my saviour's grace and love. This is my heart's cry</segment1>
		<segment2>This is my heart's cry. much more than just a great desire--it's like a fire in me. I hear my heart cry each time I think about the cross where Jesus died. The cross should have been mine but His love broke through time. And heard my heart's cry--He heard my heart's cry</segment2>
		<segment3>Now every other hope and dream is lost inside of this one thing. To know the one who died for me and live my life for Jesus Christ. Oh this is my heart's cry</segment3>
		<segment4>So let my life become a testimony of my Saviour's grace and love. Oh, this is my heart's cry--to stand before the Father one day. And hear Him say well done--this is my heart's cry     </segment4>
