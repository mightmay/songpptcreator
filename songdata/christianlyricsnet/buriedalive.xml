		<segment1>We've all broken ground. Take one look around. We're in over our heads and we keep diggin down. We've all broken ground</segment1>
		<segment2>Makin' sure nobody sees the dirt on our face. That just would not come clean. And hoping that this is the day when everything changes</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Oh, We take one last breath as the walls cave right in. Cover our heads as the weight of this world comes crashing down again. The last ray of light can no longer be found. With no point of reference to find our way out. Scream out loud. Does anybody know that we are, buried alive?</segment3>
		<segment4>We all know the sound. We've been hunted down. And we all sing along from the moment we're found. We all know the sound</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus). Oh, We take one last breath as the walls cave right in. Cover our heads as the weight of this world comes crashing down again. (Chorus)    </segment5>
