		<segment1>Next time I try to cross your mind. Remind me to look both ways, so I don't get hit by your lies. You lacerate me with all of these memories. And now, I wear these scars out on my sleeve</segment1>
		<segment2>These broken hearts are left with scars because of your lies. And all this time, it feels like I'm chasing shadows at midnight</segment2>
		<segment3>The days fade, the stars come out at night. And when the sun goes down, I know exactly what I'll find. Some things in this life will never change. We both have apologies we need to exchange</segment3>
		<segment4>How could I let myself fall into your lies?. I only trusted you with all of my life. Now I am stuck here, I'm trapped under ice. The only way out is for me not to ask why.     </segment4>
