		<segment1>If weakness is a wound that no one wants to speak of. Then cool is just how far we have to fall. I am not immune. I only wanna be loved. But I feel safe behind the firewall. Can I lose my need to impress?. If you want the truth. I need to confess</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm not alright. I'm broken inside, broken inside. And all I go through. It leads me to you, it leads me to you</segment2>
		<segment3>Burn away the pride, bring me to my weakness. Until everything I hide behind is gone. And when I'm open wide with nothing left to cling to. Only you are there to lead me on. Because honestly, I'm not that strong</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm not alright. I'm broken inside, broken inside. And all I go through. It leads me to you, it leads me to you</segment4>
		<segment5>(and I'm moved, and I'm moved, and I'm moved). Closer to you. (and I'm moved, and I'm moved, and I'm moved). Closer to you. (and I'm moved, and I'm moved, and I'm moved). Closer to you. (and I'm moved, and I'm moved, and I'm moved)</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm not alright. I'm broken inside, broken inside. I'm broken inside, broken inside. (Oh) Broken inside, broken inside. And all I go through leads me to you. Leads me to you</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm not alright. I'm not alright. I'm not alright. Thats why I need you.     </segment7>
