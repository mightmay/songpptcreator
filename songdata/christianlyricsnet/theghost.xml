		<segment1>I'll lie down for the last time. and fall well away from her. And I insist that I'll be dearly missed. (please, say never). I'll pour down like water. In between the sky and doubt. we talked about 'forever'. and all our other useless words. </segment1>
		<segment2>Until I say &quot;in his silent sound was the. peace I found&quot; but she hides behind. her eyelids. I feel the breath from. her nose on my neck as it blows by. the warmth passes me (like her love did). &quot;But a tree once cut down. came up new from the ground&quot;. she smiles a lie, &quot;that may very well be,&quot;. she replies &quot;and so it goes, it's the devil, I suppose but it doesnt matter much to me.&quot; </segment2>
		<segment3>Put music to our troubles. and we'll dance them away. </segment3>
		<segment4>From my left eye flow tears of joy, of sorrow from my right. &quot;You might seem too strong to surrender, boy, but you're far too frail to fight.&quot;. That old dull pain beats in my brain. it runs down my back into every limb-. And its more of the same. as the warmth that I seem to lack, you'll neither find in him.     </segment4>
