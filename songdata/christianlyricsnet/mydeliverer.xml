		<segment1>I was so helpless. Where did the light go. I had no hope left. Deep down in my soul. I was watchin'. I was waitin'. I was prayin'. I was stayin' down on my knees. That's right where You found me</segment1>
		<segment2>My Deliverer, You rescued me from all that held me captive. My Deliverer, You set me free. Now I'm alive and I can live. So every moment I will give you praise. My Deliverer. Ooh my Deliverer</segment2>
		<segment3>There's no pretending. I can't do it myself. I'm so dependent. Lord I need Your help. I'll be watchin'. I'll be waitin'. I'll be prayin'. I'll be stayin' down on my knees. That's right where You'll find me</segment3>
		<segment4>My Deliverer, You rescued me from all that held me captive. My Deliverer, You set me free. Now I'm alive and I can live. And every moment I will give you praise</segment4>
		<segment5>La la la la la I need You. You know whatever I'm goin' through. I'll be watchin'. I'll be waitin'. I'll be prayin'. I'll be stayin' down on my knees. That's right where You'll find me</segment5>
		<segment6>My Deliverer, You rescued me from all that held me captive. My Deliverer, You set me free. Now I can live. My Deliverer, I'm no longer captive. My Deliverer, You gave Your life that I might live. So every moment I will give you praise. Yeah my Deliverer. I'm gonna give You praise. I'm gonna give You praise. My Deliverer    </segment6>
