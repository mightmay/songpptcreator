		<segment1>A promise is forever .. Supposed to last forever. So why do promises just simply fly away. Though love has passed me by. And left me alone and crying. I still believe that love will come. Along one day</segment1>
		<segment2>If I have to search forever to find. Where love begins. I'm not exactly sure. Where I should start. But I still believe with all my soul. And heart, when it tells me ..</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Somewhere, just beyond the reach. Of my arms. You're waiting there. Somehow, I'll find my way. Into your heart. I will search everywhere. You know they say that you can't. Ever go back again. But I say. Where there's a love, there's a way. 'Till I find you somewhere .. Somehow .. someway</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't bother talkin' to me. There. Words just go right through me. You see, I've been there and I've. Heard it all before. If miracles are only .. a matter. Of believing. I can't help wondering who. Those miracles are for</segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, they say there's always. Someone for everyone, it seems. But surely that means everyone but me. Still there's a part of me that's dying. To believe .. believe that</segment5>
		<segment6>Someday - God only knows how. Long it's gonna take. Somehow - I still believe that love. Will find a way. Somewhere - where you and I will. Chance to meet one day. We're living for that moment .. Real. Love is worth the wait    </segment6>
