		<segment1>Thank your lucky stars no matter where they are, cause it's possible this is only a dream and you might wake up someplace far away, a place where you're still young. Oh wait, this is a dream.. Hesitate, all is lost. Should I count the cost of being born not number 1? I was born a trucker's son. If it were possible, I would jump in a frame. Change the family name. Oh, if it were only true, I'd wake up somewhere, someplace far away, where there's forever fun. Oh wait, it's the same dream.. Hesitate, all is lost. Should I count the cost of being born not number 1? I was born a trucker's son. Oh wait, this is a dream..    </segment1>
