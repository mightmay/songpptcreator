		<segment1>I found it hard to believe, someone like you came for me. You put this love in my heart. I tried, I could, I refused, you gave me no time to choose. You put this love in my heart. I wanna know where the bad feelings go. When I'm depressed and I get down so low. Then if I see you calling to me, it's all right. I wanna tell you right now, I'm not afraid to say how. You put this love in my heart. There's sometimes when I doubt, But you offer me out. You put this love in my heart. Cause when I see that you died for me. So when I was down I had to believe. Cause you following her, proving all your love. And I know the loneliness I've had before. In God now, I never feel it anymore. Cause your lovin has released me. From all that is in my past. So much more I could say. If I could just find a way. You put this love in my heart. It's all so thrilling to me, I feel so good I could scream. You put this love in my heart </segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna know where the bad feelings go. When I'm depressed and I get down so low. Then if I see you calling to me, it's all right.     </segment2>
