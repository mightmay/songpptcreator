		<segment1>I've got something to talk about. I've had a lot on my mind. But I think I finally figured out. What I'm feeling on the inside. 'Cause where I wanna be. Is in the thick of things. It's all I'm thinking about</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. These are exciting times. I can see that You are leading me. And it feels so right. I'm assured of this, my offering. I'm finally living. 'Cause these are exciting times</segment2>
		<segment3>Things can happen so rapidly. Then again, they can take a lot of time. But I know these things are not up to me. But I'll be ready in the mean time. Opportunity is calling out to me. I lay it all on the line</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>This thing is bigger than me. And I'm just wanting to be a part of. Anything and everything You ask of me</segment5>
		<segment6>These are exciting times.. I can see that You are leading me</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS    </segment7>
