		<segment1>Stabbing my chest. with your brush of hopelessness. And this whole time I fell for it. I fell for it. You think you can pull this over my eyes. I can see this without sight. Slowly fade away. IÂ’ll walk with my thought. But my heart will always stay. I wish you could have painted a moment. A moment with all sincerity. A moment with all honesty. I can see without sight.     </segment1>
