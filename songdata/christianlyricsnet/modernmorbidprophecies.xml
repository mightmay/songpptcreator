		<segment1>Do we have the time to lay the line between true life, and you in mine. I want to reel it back before the day when simplicity was washed away. </segment1>
		<segment2>Like modern morbid prophecies fulfilled. Like biting on these bitter tasting pills. And we're just heroes, And we're just heroes. For the day. </segment2>
		<segment3>There's a silent urge to leave this cloud when all I want is to hear the sound, Of your voice devoid of the constant noise, the only sound to fill this void. </segment3>
		<segment4>And do you want this. And do you still need this. </segment4>
		<segment5>Like modern morbid prophecies fulfilled. Like biting on these bitter tasting pills. And we're just heroes, And we're just heroes. </segment5>
		<segment6>They all won't love me, she won't let me forget. </segment6>
		<segment7>Like modern morbid prophecies fulfilled. Like biting on these bitter tasting pills. And we're just heroes, And we're just heroes. </segment7>
		<segment8>Don't make me choose, I'll choose you and this will all be over.     </segment8>
