		<segment1>The battle's over. My heart moves on. I kept my mouth shut. While you screamed and cried. All the lies, all the lies</segment1>
		<segment2>The battle's over. My heart moves on. Stood and took the arrows. That cut through my heart. I stood alone, I stood alone</segment2>
		<segment3>You broke down all my walls. I'll build them up again. The battle's over now, my heart moves on</segment3>
		<segment4>Today I stand, to watch you fall. That's just to say I've had enough. Not even you. Can stop me now. My heart moves on can't stop me now</segment4>
		<segment5>. My heart moves on. My heart moves on. My heart moves on. My heart.     </segment5>
