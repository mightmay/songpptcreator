		<segment1>You've been dropped like a dream to the floor. You've been told not to try anymore. But you're wakened from yesterday's war. Cause you're a survivor</segment1>
		<segment2>And your strength has been stolen away. And your faith has been worn to a fray. But you live to live on one more day. Cause you're a survivor</segment2>
		<segment3>And nothing can stop you now. Nothing can back you down. You never give up. You never give in. You're a survivor</segment3>
		<segment4>For the phone call that tore you apart. For the fear that gripped your heart. For the moment you saw who you are. And what you're made of</segment4>
		<segment5>For the cancer that stole all your hair. For the smile like you just don't care. For your hope in midnight prayer. You're a survivor</segment5>
		<segment6>And nothing can stop you now. Nothing can back you down. You never give up. You never give in. You're a survivor</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm convinced neither death nor life. Neither demons or angels of light. Shadows present a future bright. Can seperate us</segment7>
		<segment8>From the love that will lead us on. To the hope when all hope is gone. Til the day heaven calls us home. We are survivors</segment8>
		<segment9>And nothing can stop us now. Nothing can back us down. We never give up. We never give in</segment9>
		<segment10>And nothing can stop us now. Nothing can back us down. We never give up. We never give in. Cause we are survivors</segment10>
		<segment11>We are. We are. Yeah. We are survivors. We are survivors    </segment11>
