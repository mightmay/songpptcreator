		<segment1>Take this blindfold off of me. I'm walking but I cannot see. Mysteries fly at my feet. The answers come with no relief</segment1>
		<segment2>Broken shoes won't get you far. Climb on my back I'll carry you afar. Words just feel anatheistized. But hope is found within the lies</segment2>
		<segment3>And I keep walking down that road. And I keep running down that road</segment3>
		<segment4>Take this blindfold off of me. I'm crawling, grabbing, breathing for the way I can see. Hold me, take me, run with me, I know you'll ignite. A battered flame that once was bright</segment4>
		<segment5>And I keep walking down that road. And I keep running down that road</segment5>
		<segment6>Glory, glory. Glory, in the highest    </segment6>
