		<segment1>When I think of all I've seen. Nothing compares to what you give. And to drink of what you bring you quench. The thirst for me to live. I am satisfied by what tenderness you've shown to me. and I empty all that I am. And you fill my life you're everything to me. There's nothing else I need anymore. And I know you are everything to me and. There's nothing else I need anymore. I have tasted and I know this fire birthed. Inside will only grow and I've sought all that. This world tried to offer me and it lead me. To your feet and I empty all that I am. And you fill my life you're everything to me. There's nothing else I need anymore. And I know you are everything to me and. There's nothing else I need anymore. I will lay down all my needs and you will. Come and make them new. To make you my only desire my desire. And you fill my life you're everything to me. And you fill my life you're everything to me. There's nothing else I need anymore. And I know you are everything to me and. There's nothing else I need anymore. There's nothing else I need..    </segment1>
