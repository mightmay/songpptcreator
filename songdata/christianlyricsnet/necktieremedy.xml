		<segment1>You say: &quot;Make me into something. Give me a body&quot;. And you say: &quot;Let me out the bottle. Make me into someone. You can give me life. And I'll trade. The potion you embody with. Trips down the well and a swing from a necktie remedy, necktie remedy.&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;You can give me life..&quot; </segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;Let me in, it's cold in this abyss. Let me in cause it's cold. You'll raise your drinks up high and swallow to forget. You'll raise your drinks up high. We'll swallow to forget&quot; </segment3>
		<segment4>You say: &quot;The sugarcube mixture saves the day.&quot;. You say: &quot;The green cloudy waters will take you away.&quot;. But when dawn floods in. With the day. The journey I imagined brought. Me right back here to swing from these necktie remedies, necktie remedies </segment4>
		<segment5>&quot;Let me in, it's cold in this abyss. Let me in cause it's cold. You'll raise your drinks up high and swallow to forget. You'll raise your drinks up high. We'll swallow to forget&quot; </segment5>
		<segment6>&quot;Let me in.&quot; </segment6>
		<segment7>&quot;You'll be vacant. Repossessed. For those moments. That you occupy me.&quot; </segment7>
		<segment8>&quot;Now let's make me something in and of myself. And become the cataclysmic reality. So far beyond the symptom, I, limitless when you empower me. Because habit takes root in a decision. And you can bet that I can wait. If you can. For the moment when you need a little pick me up. A little bump. A little boost. A little helping hand.&quot;.     </segment8>
