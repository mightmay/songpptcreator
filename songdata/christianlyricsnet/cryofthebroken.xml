		<segment1>VERSE 1:</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord I come. Lord I thank you. For your love. For this grace divine. Love and mercy. Undeserving. You gave it all. The greatest sacrifice</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS 1: You were wounded. For my sin. You were bruised. For all my shame. You were broken. For my healing. Only by the cross. I am saved</segment3>
		<segment4>VERSE 2:</segment4>
		<segment5>You're the mender of the broken. To every outcast. A friend and comforter</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS 2:</segment6>
		<segment7>I come boldly to your presence. Lord I bow before your throne. You're my healer. My redeemer. You're my hope, my life, my heart</segment7>
		<segment8>BRIDGE:</segment8>
		<segment9>You hear the cry of the broken. You hear the cry of the broken. You hear the cry of the broken. You answer the cry of the broken. You answer the cry of the broken. You answer the cry of the broken    </segment9>
