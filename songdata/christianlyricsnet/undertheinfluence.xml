		<segment1>People are talkin'. 'Bout the way I'm walkin'. Troubled by the change in my stride. Everyone's askin'. Â´Bout the way I'm actin'. Bothered by the look in my eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>They can see a difference. In my way of livin'. But they don't know the reason why. I can't wait to tell them what is wrong with me</segment2>
		<segment3>Love without condition. This is my addiction. It's a need that only God can fill. Once I got to taste it. Nothing could replace it. Now I've let it overtake my will</segment3>
		<segment4>I admit my weakness. Craving its sweetness. I have given in to its control. Love has got a hold on me and won't let go</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm under, under the influence. I'm under, under the influence. I'm under the influence of love</segment5>
		<segment6>Used to feel empty. Now I have plenty. Ever since I drank from the fountain. With the Spirit in me. And the strength It gives me. A little faith can move mountains</segment6>
		<segment7>Take my life, use me Lord. Shine Your light through me for. All the world to see that I am not my own</segment7>
		<segment8>repeat chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>What the world needs is love sweet love. What the world needs is love sweet love    </segment9>
