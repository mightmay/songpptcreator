		<segment1>[Verse 1:]. When you fall asleep tonight. In your warm and cozy room. Know that I'm awake. And I've got no shelter and no food</segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-Chorus 1:]. I am not alone. My friends are broke and lost. Looking for someone to lead them to my cross. I need your help, I need your help</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus 1:]. Won't you be My voice calling. Won't you be My hands healing. Won't you be My feet walking into a broken world. Won't you be My chain-breaker. Won't you be My peacemaker. Won't you be My hope and joy. Won't you be My Love</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 2:]. The other side of the world. She is just a few days old. A helpless little girl. With no family of her own</segment4>
		<segment5>[Pre-Chorus 2:]. She is not to blame for the journey she is on. Her life is no mistake. Won't you lead her to My cross?</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus 1:]. Won't you be My voice calling. Won't you be My hands healing. Won't you be My feet walking into a broken world. Won't you be My chain-breaker. Won't you be My peacemaker. Won't you be My hope and joy. Won't you be My Love</segment6>
		<segment7>[Bridge:]. To those I call My own. To those I've set aside. As spotless without blame. The chosen ones My bride</segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus 2:]. We will be Your voice calling. We will be Your hands healing. We will be Your feet walking into a broken world. We will be Your chain-breaker. We will be Your peacemaker. We will be Your hope and joy. We will be Your love     </segment8>
