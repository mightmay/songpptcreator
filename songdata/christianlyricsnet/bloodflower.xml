		<segment1>I've seen this too many times before. Lust gripping my heart and ripping it out. I've seen this all too many times. I need you here, with me</segment1>
		<segment2>I know this, I fear this, I love this, I hate this. God help me, God heal me, I need a way out. And every time I close my eyes I start to pray &quot;take me away&quot;. Do you even know my name. Do you even care how I feel inside?. This lust won't win again. Everything I am depends on it, help me (Jesus)</segment2>
		<segment3>God please help me. I need saving.     </segment3>
