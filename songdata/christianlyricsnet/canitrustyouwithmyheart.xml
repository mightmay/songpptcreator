		<segment1>When you meet that certain someone you been searchin' hard to find. It's a new love full of passion that can sometimes make you blind. I don't mind bein' swept away if I know right from the start. So before we go much further girl can I trust you with my heart</segment1>
		<segment2>In the time we've spent together I have learned to trust in you. So many things you've given before I even asked you to. But reality and romance are sometimes far apart. So what I really need to know is can I trust you with my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand a heavy load. Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road. If you promise me these simple things I can guaranty. You can always count on me</segment3>
		<segment4>Can I cast my cares upon you, can you stand a heavy load. Can I count on you to walk me down that long and winding road</segment4>
		<segment5>When two hearts solely surrender and are sworn to understand. It completes a perfect union between a woman and a man. So please don't misunderstand me I don't want to go too far. Without knowing just one answer can I trust you with my heart</segment5>
		<segment6>Please girl give me just one answer can I trust you with my heart?.     </segment6>
