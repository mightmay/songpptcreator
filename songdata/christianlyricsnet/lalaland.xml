		<segment1>The question isn't whether it's true. The question &quot;is it working for you?&quot;. Marshmallow skies. And custardy pies. And nothing's too hard to do</segment1>
		<segment2>They're five happy verses or so. They told me all I needed to know. Ignore all the rest. Trials and tests. And threats to my comfort zone</segment2>
		<segment3>Well I've got no time to find out what's real. I stick with what I happen to feel. It feels grand. When you're livin' in a lala land </segment3>
		<segment4>You can name a blessing yourself. Stake a claim on power and wealth. And strong healthy teeth. A spot at the beach. And romance that's really swell</segment4>
		<segment5>All the saints and martyrs alike. Well they would have called a national strike. Demanded less pain. More personal gain. If only they'd known their rights</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus:). Well I take it very personally. Yeah, I got to know what's in it for me. Ain't it grand?. When you're livin' in a lala land</segment6>
		<segment7>I've got my prayer cloth collection in a Jesus jar. I've got the Holy Ghost ridin' in the back of my car. Sometimes He gives a little tickle I go &quot;hardee har har&quot;. Ain't it grand, when you're livin' in a lala land</segment7>
		<segment8>My Jesus decal does quite a trick. Right above my dashboard I stick it. A good luck charm. It keeps me from harm. And saves me from speeding tickets</segment8>
		<segment9>(Repeat Chorus)    </segment9>
