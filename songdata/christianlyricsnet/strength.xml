		<segment1>In these remaining days, let us not be tangled in. Mankind's celebration of itself. Rather, let us live as children of God. For what fellowship hath light and darkness. Good with evil?. Shall grace be as pearls to swine. Or held higher than gold?</segment1>
		<segment2>Let them know the difference</segment2>
		<segment3>Keep your signs - hold your banners yourself. Send no &quot;latest cause&quot; this way. Need no factions, political distractions. Keep them out of my face. Spare the fashion codes and social pars. And the vanity of it all. To subscribe would be to sell-out. And to set up for a fall</segment3>
		<segment4>Can't you see the road you travel down. Leads swiftly to your end. Sold as slaves for a place to hide. A temporary defense</segment4>
		<segment5>Then he'll come, all will be lost. You'll be swept with the tide, your shelter of clay. He's calling, protection is here. Your grip will not hold when your world's laid to waste. Lord, grant me the strength, to follow your path. To not go astray i, alone in myself. I'm feeling the pull, Lord, grant me the strength</segment5>
		<segment6>Once again breathing down my neck. The smell of the generous leach. The liberating hypocrite. Come to save, to teach, to preach. To save me from my slavery</segment6>
		<segment7>From a God who doesn't know what's best. Look - keep your rebellion to yourself. You don't know me, my God, or the life I live</segment7>
		<segment8>Not a patriot, revolutionist. Not a left or right wing voice. Don't need a liberal or conservative. To tell me about freedom of choice. My freedom comes from God above. Forgiveness beyond comprehension. Stregth not found in earthly powers. The only true deliverance    </segment8>
