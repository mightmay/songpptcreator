		<segment1>[Verse 1:].  I'm an alien.  Cuz I'm not of this world.  I have a name.  but I've been changed, and now I can't stay the same.  and I'm a loser if that means I've been lost before.  but now I found it, I'm surrounded.  Cuz you can hear the way it sounded</segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-Chorus].  Like angels singing with a million voices</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:].  The end is where we begin.  It's crawling back when.  We run away, run away.  cuz the end is where we begin.  Where broken hearts mend.  and start to beat again.  The end is where we begin</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 2:].  I'm a monster if that means I'm misunderstood.  Cuz its alive and I can't hide it.  The energy is rising.  and I'm a traitor if that means I've turned on myself.  I can't deny it, it's like a riot.  and I can't keep it quiet</segment4>
		<segment5>[Pre-Chorus].  Like angels singing with a million voices</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus:].  The end is where we begin.  It's crawling back when.  We run away, run away.  Cuz the end is where we begin.  Where broken hearts mend.  and start to beat again.  The end is where we begin</segment6>
		<segment7>[Bridge:].  Hear me running.  Hear me running, running.  Hear me running, hear me running, ra-running.  Hear me running, hear me</segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus:].  The end is where we begin.  It's crawling back when.  We run away, run away.  Cuz the end is where we begin.  Where broken hearts mend.  and start to beat again</segment8>
		<segment9> The end is where we begin.  It's crawling back when.  We run away, run away.  Cuz the end is where we begin.  Where broken hearts mend.  and start to beat again.  The end is where we begin    </segment9>
