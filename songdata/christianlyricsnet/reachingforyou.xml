		<segment1>You created me inside Your great imagination. You're the One who gave me my first breath. You have overseen my life and brought me to redemption. And I know that You're not finished with me yet</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm reaching for You. I'm singing to You. I'm lifting my hands to praise You. I'm lifting my voice to thank You. I'm reaching for You. Jesus I need You. I'm giving my heart to know You. I'm living my life to serve You. I'm reaching for You</segment2>
		<segment3>You're the one who spoke the Word of life to light my darkness. You opened up my eyes 'til I could see. Jesus You have promised to complete the work You started. Faithful to fulfill Your grace in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Pour out Your love from heaven. Fill me until I overflow Lord I want more. Reach down Your hands from heaven. Pull me closer than ever before Lord I want more. Pour out Your love from heaven. Fill me until I overflow 'cause I want more. Reach down Your hands from heaven. Pull me closer than ever before Lord I want more</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh I'm reaching. God I'm reaching for You    </segment5>
