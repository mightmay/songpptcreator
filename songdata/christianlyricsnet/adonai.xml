		<segment1>Genesis 15:2, Matthew 5:6, Hebrews 12:29, Psalms 40:2. Words &amp; Music by Bob Hartman. This thirsting within my soul. Won't cease till I've been made whole. To know You, to walk with You. To please You in all I do. You uphold the righteous and Your faithfulness shall endure. Adonai, Master of the earth and sky. You alone are worthy, Adonai. Adonai, let creation testify. Let Your majesty be magnified in me. Adonai you are an endless mystery. Unchanging consuming fire. Lift me up from mud and mire. Set my feet on Your rock, let me dwell in Your righteousness. When the storms surround me, speak the word and they will be still. And this thirst and hunger is a longing only You can fill.     </segment1>
