		<segment1>Where 69 meets 40. There's a single stop light town. And back when I was really young. Part of that burned down. On any given Friday nite. We'd drive a hundred miles. Between the Sonic and the grocery store. Laugin' all the while. With as many friends as I could pack. In my Daddy's Ford. But I ain't in Checotah anymore. My hotel in Manhattan. Holds more people than our town. And what I just paid for dinner. Would be a down payment on a house. I'd rather be tippin' cows in Tulsa. Than hailin' cabs here in New York. But I ain't in Checotah anymore. In a world of long red carpets. The bright lights of Hollywood. All the paparazzi flashin'. Can make a girl feel pretty good. You can get anything you want here. Except a Walmart store. But I ain't in Checotah anymore. Chorus: I'm in a world so wide. It makes me feel small sometimes. I miss the big blue sky. The Oaklohoma kind. Bridge: Where the Wildcats beat Iron Heads. Old settler's day and the Okra fest. After prom down at the bowlin lanes. Catchin' crappie fish in Eufaula Lake.     </segment1>
