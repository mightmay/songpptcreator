		<segment2>I've been writing words that mean a bit of nothing. Just to sing it loud and cash in deeds for fame. I won't put a finger out the door. Until I've spilled my guts on paper. And feel it so meaningful. So sing with me if you know the words. I've got a feeling I've used this phrase before. When it goes into the verse. Then I throw hands over to the crowds, Not a single word is moving, But tonight I'm breaking ground. I'm looking for an open door when it's over. You know it's over. I've gotta find a sign or a way to pull myself together. Before I walk up there tonight. Or I'll be sitting up so late with my face in. My hands and tears in my eyes screaming is it over. I've been plotting this escape, Not thinking of the consequences of my mistakes. I just want to be found, then get lost in you!.     </segment2>
