		<segment1>&quot;The world breaks every one and. afterward many are strong at the broken places&quot;.     -- from &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; by Ernest Hemingway</segment1>
		<segment2>the ice is thin enough for walkin'. the rope is worn enough to climb. throat is dry enough for talkin'. world is crumblin', but i know why. world is crumblin', but i know why</segment2>
		<segment3>storm is wild enough for sailing. bridge is weak enough to cross. this body frail enough for fighting. i'm home enough to know i'm lost. home enough to know i'm lost</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: it's just enough to be strong. in the broken places, in the broken places. it's just enough to be strong. should the world rely on faith tonight</segment4>
		<segment5>land unfit enough for planting. barren enough to conceive. poor enough to gain the treasure. enough a cynic to believe. enough a cynic to believe</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]</segment6>
		<segment7>confused enough to know direction. sun eclipsed enough to shine. be still enough to finally tremble. see enough to know i'm blind. see enough to know i'm blind</segment7>
		<segment8>[CHORUS x 2]</segment8>
		<segment9>should the world rely on faith tonight. should the world rely on faith tonight. tonight. tonight. tonight. tonight. tonight</segment9>
