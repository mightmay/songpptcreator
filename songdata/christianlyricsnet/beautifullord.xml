		<segment1>When the storm is raging all around me. You are the peace that calms. My troubled sea. And when the cares of this world. Darken my day. You are the light that shines. And shows me the way</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, the beauty of Your majesty. On the cross You showed Your love for me!</segment2>
		<segment3>Beautiful Lord. Awesome and mighty. I'm captured by this love I see. Beautiful Lord. Tender and holy. Your mercy brings me to my knees. It's Your mercy that has made me free. Beautiful Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>When my sin is all that I can see. Your grace remains the shelter that I seek. And when my weakness is all I can give. Your gentle Spirit gives me strength again. And oh, the beauty of Your majesty. On the cross You showed Your love for me</segment4>
		<segment5>And I am lifted by Your love to sing!. It's Your mercy that has made me free!</segment5>
		<segment6>You're beautiful, my Lord. You're beautiful, my Lord    </segment6>
