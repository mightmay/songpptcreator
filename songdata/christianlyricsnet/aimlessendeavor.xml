		<segment1>Remembering the moments. It's so unclear. Re-living it just to disappear. It's always the wrong way. And never the same. It's dragging and staggered. Into a dull replay. Remember the moments. It's so unclear. Re-living it just to disappear. Lying down in sleepless eyes. Wide awake. So caught inside this aimless endeavor. It's sure to leave it's mark. Blacked-out and beaten into our skin. Deeper now that it's sunk in. Feeding on all of this damage it's done. The deeper you look. The harder it is to find. It's so safe and so secure. It's so deep now. Blacked-out and beaten into our skin. Deeper now that we've fell in    </segment1>
