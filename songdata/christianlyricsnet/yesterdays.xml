		<segment1>yesterday another way things would work out they'd be ok. another time doing fine i always said it'd be all right. well i used to be ok. in the hands of yesterday. the darkness came in fast. the feeling wouldn't last</segment1>
		<segment2>now i'm all alone i don't even know. what i'm living for what to call my home. is it all a dream or a deadly scheme. just a big mistake and i can't explain. what's happening to me</segment2>
		<segment3>just today i walked away from everything how could this be. i can't believe i used to be somebody real i can't conceive. how i used to be ok. in the hands of yesterday. the darkness came in fast. the feeling wouldn't last</segment3>
		<segment4>now i'm all alone i don't even know. what i'm living for what to call my home. is it all a dream or a deadly scheme. just a big mistake and i can't explain. what's happening to me</segment4>
		<segment5>so i've tried to make sense of all the insanity. but i cannot see. realize all the complications of humanity. there's nothing more to be. and it ain't gonna be all right. so why put up a fight</segment5>
		<segment6>well i used to be ok. in the hands of yesterday. the darkness came in fast. the feeling wouldn't last</segment6>
		<segment7>now i'm all alone i don't even know. what i'm living for what to call my home. is it all a dream or a deadly scheme. just a big mistake and i can't explain. what's happening to me    </segment7>
