		<segment1>Lies are sweet and ordinary. Listen closely you'll hear it in me</segment1>
		<segment2>Find my way back so I can downsize. Stayed up so late I could hear the sun rise. Be it quiet be it soon. When you sleep take my penance. Make me guilty</segment2>
		<segment3>In your bed beneath my room. The water quickly covers you. Slowly I regain some feeling. My hands are blue my fingers bleeding</segment3>
		<segment4>Lies are sweet and ordinary</segment4>
		<segment5>In your bed beneath my room. The water quickly covers you. Slowly I regain some feeling. My hands are blue my fingers bleeding    </segment5>
