		<segment1>theres no light in my life. and i feel cold as the night. i got lost along the way. and i feel lonely, i feel so afraid. and ive had all that i can take. . CHORUS: love take hold of me tonight. cleanse my soul and make me right. before my heart sink too low. love take hold of me tonight. . ive never been here before. i need some help from You Lord. the waters deep and im losing ground. if You dont save me God im going down. reach Your hand out to me now. . chorus    </segment1>
