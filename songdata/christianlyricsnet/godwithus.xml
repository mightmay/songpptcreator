		<segment1>Who are we. That You would be mindful of us. What do You see. Thats worth looking our way</segment1>
		<segment2>We are free. In ways that we never should be. Sweet release. From the grip of these chains</segment2>
		<segment3>Like hinges straining from the weight. My heart no longer can keep from singing</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. All that is within me cries. For You alone be glorified. Emmanuel. God with us</segment4>
		<segment5>My heart sings a brand new song. The debt is paid these chains are gone. Emmanuel. God with us</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord You know. Our hearts dont deserve Your glory. Still You show. A love we cannot afford </segment6>
		<segment7>Like hinges straining from the weight. My heart no longer can keep from singing</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Bridge. Such a tiny offering compared to Calvary. Nevertheless we lay it at Your feet</segment9>
		<segment10>Chorus.     </segment10>
