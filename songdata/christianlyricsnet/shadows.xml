		<segment1>Life is full of light and shadow. O the joy and O the sorrow. O the sorrow</segment1>
		<segment2>And yet will He bring. Dark to light. And yet will He bring. Day from night</segment2>
		<segment3>When shadows fall on us. We will not fear. We will remember</segment3>
		<segment4>When darkness falls on us. We will not fear. We will remember</segment4>
		<segment5>When all seems lost. When we're thrown and we're tossed. We remember the cost. We rest in Him. Shadow of the cross</segment5>
