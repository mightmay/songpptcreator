		<segment1>You have walked so deep a canyon. Deep a canyon now. In the end you know that you've been found. You're found. Heaven sure fell hard upon you. Hard upon you now. In the end you know that you've been found. You're found </segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, you belong now. Oh, you are free </segment2>
		<segment3>So open wide the arms you're given. You're too alive to just stand still. Open wide your heart as you breathe in. You're too alive to just stay here </segment3>
		<segment4>You wondered how your searching heart. Your searching heart would roam. Coming to the place that you'd call home. You're home </segment4>
		<segment5>You're shaken up. Awaken. You gotta live, you gotta love     </segment5>
