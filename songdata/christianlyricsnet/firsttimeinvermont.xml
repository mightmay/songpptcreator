		<segment1>&quot;it is easy to promise, and alas! how easy to forget!&quot;. -alfred de musset</segment1>
		<segment2>chasing words. are you still frightened. heard you called. caught my wanderings. thought they'd see. see it my way</segment2>
		<segment3>broken words. i am frightened now</segment3>
		<segment4>we could stand together if i'd just speak out. we could find a meaning on this torn blue couch</segment4>
		<segment5>broken mouth. a fortune to make up. sickened heart. all for you my love. thought you'd see. see it my way. in turn. we'll sing out loud</segment5>
		<segment6>we could stand together if i'd just speak out. we could find a meaning on this torn blue couch</segment6>
		<segment7>in my head the reasons are all on display. i could tell you everything but not today</segment7>
		<segment8>please don't ask why till we rise. your dreams are mine.     </segment8>
