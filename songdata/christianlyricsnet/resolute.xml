		<segment1>reaping the seeds i planted. things that i always took for granted. i feel a little bit unstable. tell me if i'm willing are you able. to come and help me out right now?. if you do, i'm resolute. i wont back down. broken and i'm still breaking. change is my latest undertaking. im only hoping that tomorrow. has a greater hope for me to borrow. im separated from the rest. i will try, but i can only do my best. today i saw myself with honest eyes. and my face i barely recognized. if the wounded never heal. what will i do?. how will i feel?. can i assume, at least pretend, that things will work out in the end?. sunken and I'm still sinking. and you're the only thing I'm thinking of. ties that I could hardly sever. when I'm needing you now more than ever.     </segment1>
