		<segment1>I know you walk around this life without hope. Just tryin' to figure out a way you can cope, well. You do so many things to escape you fears. that you will never make it, You'll always have to fake being happy. I know the truth you can believe it or not. There's a way out of this way of living, But your trust must be giving willingly. Someone to rescue you from all your disgrace. Who will show you all his mercy, love and grace</segment1>
		<segment2>More than you know, More than you could ever dream. There's so much more, Waiting for you than it seems. If you'll only believe</segment2>
		<segment3>I know you wonder what your life's all about. When it comes to your future, you have your doubts. There's only one who can make you feel secure. Who will lead you through this life, (Where you'll spend eternity you can be sure). You think the only heaven you'll ever know. Is the little bit of blue sky. you see when your troubles seem to gofor a little while. There's a lasting pleasure, a fuller measure of joy and peace. When you look inside and know. you've been set free.     </segment3>
