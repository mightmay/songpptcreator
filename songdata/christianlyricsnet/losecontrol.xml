		<segment1>This is what it feels like. To lose control. This is what it feels like. To be left alone. This is what it feels like. To lose a friend. This is what it feels like. To reach the end</segment1>
		<segment2>God came down. And walked beside me. God came down. He sent friends to guide me. God came down to remind me. This is what it feels like. To be loved</segment2>
		<segment3>This is what it feels like. To face the truth. This is what it feels like. To know it's through. This is what it feels like. To say goodbye. This is what it feels like. For a man to cry    </segment3>
