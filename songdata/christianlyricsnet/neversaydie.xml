		<segment1>Whispers in the wind carry messages to lovers far. Tales of lost romance and of that missed chance and fleeting hearts. Yesterday, befriends anger with words you say. Don't let those dying ships sail away. Promise me you'll never say die. Ashes in the sand bury witnesses to broken hearts. Scars of lone memories and of those crushed dreams and open arms. Love songs and tidal waves have washed me away.     </segment1>
