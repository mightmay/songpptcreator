		<segment1>Awake to the sound of emptiness. Alone in a room that is filled with the darkest of light. I was told there was nothing beyond here. How do I know what side I'm on?. Breathe!. A captive with nothing but the thoughts increasing, Worsening I dont belong here. But I cant find my exit. This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down. Where they go to hunt me down, they hunt me down</segment1>
		<segment2>Weigh out the options. Pave the narrow. I know what you're thinking. Come on man I swear you can do this. Come on man I swear you can do this. I break free from this room they built for me. I break free from this room they built for me</segment2>
		<segment3>This is where they all come to hunt me down, hunt me down. Where they go to hunt me down, they hunt me down</segment3>
		<segment4>I tore out my lying eyes. So they locked me up. I tore out my lying eyes. So they locked me up. Preying on the innocent    </segment4>
