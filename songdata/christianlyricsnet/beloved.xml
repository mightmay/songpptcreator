		<segment1>Love of my life. Look deep in my eyes. There you will find what you need</segment1>
		<segment2>Give me your life. The lust and the lies. And the past you're afraid I might see. You've been running away from me</segment2>
		<segment3>You're my beloved lover. I'm yours. Death shall not part us. It's you I died for. For better or worse. Forever we'll be. My love it unites us and it binds you to me. It's a mystery</segment3>
		<segment4>Love of my life. Look deep in my eyes. There you will find what you need</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm the giver of life. I'll clothe you in white. My immaculate bride you will be. Come running home to me</segment5>
		<segment6>You've been a mistress, my wife. Chasing lovers that won't satisfy. Won't you let me make you my bride. You will drink of my lips and you'll taste new life</segment6>
