		<segment1>[Verse 1:]. Lord, You are good and Your mercy endureth forever and ever, Your power is greater than anything. Because of Your grace I have life everlasting and more abundantly Lord You mean everything. [Chorus A:]. And I will worship You most high, and I'll bless Your name O God, for You are worthy of the highest praise. Hallelujah to Your name. [Verse 2:]. Blessed, be the name of the Lord, most high there is no one above, You are perfect in all of Your ways. Strength of my life You are everything, holy, that's what the angels sing, and I owe You the rest of my days. [Chorus B:]. And I will worship You most high, for You are Lord of all the earth, You're the king who reigns forever. Hallelujah to Your name. [Verse 3:]. Savior, Your love has lifted me, master I live for You totally, my heart is now and forever Your's. Jesus, Your name above every name, King of Kings, Lord of Lords You reign and the devil is defeated today. Oh oh oh. [Chorus C:]. And I will worship You most high, and my heart shall sing Your praise, for the name Jesus has all power. Hallelujah to Your name. Hallelujah</segment1>
