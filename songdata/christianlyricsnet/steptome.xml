		<segment1>I've been as far as you can go. I've learned a lot and now I know. You're never gonna get me on the floor again. I'm prepared to take you to the end. Never gonna play your games again. Bring your whole team and all your friends. But I hope your listenin' </segment1>
		<segment2>BRIDGE. Haunt me if you want me. But I'll warn you. If you ever step to me </segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. I sometimes wish that I could fly. Hold me tight in your arms tonight. Sick of livin' inside a lie, alright. I can't count the times I've tried. Stand alone just to lift you high. You're my answer to the question why </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm sick of letting you control. The places that I go. I'm never giving into you again. Take, take another look at me. And tell me what you see. All of these kats tryin' to get under my skin. But they can't step over me. You try to control me. But ya can't hold me. You don't own me. If you ever step to me </segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS </segment5>
		<segment6>I know it's not me. Take a look inside me. I'm sick of these ways. So sick of these games. Couldn't see it til I multiplied you. Call me a freak. But I don't hear the words you speak. I'm takin' control. Just lettin' you know. That I won't get sucked in by you </segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS. BRIDGE </segment7>
		<segment8>Again, you try to control me. But ya can't hold me. You don't own me. If you ever step to me     </segment8>
