		<segment1>Hold down your hands. and close your eyes. Trust me this time. i've got something in mind</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't try to guess. or you'll miss it all together. The timing's more important. to me anyways</segment2>
		<segment3>And i'll watch you dance. when you see the plans i've made for us. when you take my hand. (i love you)</segment3>
		<segment4>I like that smile. i see on your face. It shows me where your heart is. and you've given me a place</segment4>
		<segment5>And when life starts changing. please don't run away. Hide in my arms. and you will be saved</segment5>
		<segment6>And i'll watch you dance. when you see the plans i've made for us. when you take my hand. (i love you)</segment6>
		<segment7>(i'll watch you dance, i'll watch you dance) x3</segment7>
		<segment8>and i'll watch you dance. (i'll watch you dance, i'll watch you dance). when you see the plans i've made for us. when you take my hand. (i'll watch you dance, i'll watch you dance. i love you. i love you)    </segment8>
