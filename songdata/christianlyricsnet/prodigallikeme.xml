		<segment1>Joshua blow your trumpets towards the walls around my heart. And you better bring your army come and tear my world apart. Moses help me wander from the desert that Ive found. Cause it feels like forever since my knees have touched the ground</segment1>
		<segment2>I never thought I would be this way. To let what we were begin to fade. I never thought I could say goodbye to all we had. I never thought I would come to be. Alone with all my apathy. I never thought You could still love a prodigal like me</segment2>
		<segment3>David grab a stone and sling it toward my giant pride. Debra call the troops cause Im ready for a fight. Peter theres a roaster did you once again deny. Or am I the guilty one who cant look Him in the eye</segment3>
		<segment4>(Prodigal like) me with so much sin and shame. In need of such amazing grace. But still I find I turn away from You    </segment4>
