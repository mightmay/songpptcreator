		<segment1>O Lord, the clouds are gathering. The fire of judgement burns. How we have fallen!. O Lord, you stand appalled to see. Your laws of love so scorned. And lives so broken</segment1>
		<segment2>Have mercy, Lord, (Men). Have mercy, Lord, (Women). Forgive us, Lord, (Men). Forgive us, Lord (Women). Restore us, Lord (All). Revive your church again. Let justice flow (Men). Let justice flow (Women). Like rivers (Men). Like rivers (Women). And righteousness like a never failing stream (All)</segment2>
		<segment3>O Lord, over the nations now. Where is the dove of peace?. Her wings are broken. O Lord, while precious children starve. The tools of war increaseTheir bread is stolen</segment3>
		<segment4>O Lord, dark powers are poised to flood. Our streets with hate and fear. We must awaken!. O Lord, let love reclaim the lives. That sin would sweep away. And let your kingdom come</segment4>
		<segment5>Yet, O Lord, your glorious cross shall tower. Triumphant in this land. Evil confounding. Through the fire your suffering church display. The glories of her Christ. Praises resounding!</segment5>
