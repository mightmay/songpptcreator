		<segment1>Shatter my emotions. Take them all away. Left alone to face You. Now You know my heart. Left only to speak what is true. See through this plague of flesh. With truth I say that I love You. Yet my heart betrays me. Be not far from me. For these voices. They must soon cease. Despite their betrayal. You died for me    </segment1>
