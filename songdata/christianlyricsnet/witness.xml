		<segment1>Can I get a witness?. ah-. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can you get with this?. ah-. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>Yeah(5x)</segment2>
		<segment3>Lookin' for some ladies and some young men. To run the race and endure to the very end. No turning back, no quitting if you're gonna win. Your mark, get set, running like a champion</segment3>
		<segment4>Have you heard the story about Joshua?. He was young, strong, and courageous. Not by power nor was it by might my friend. &quot;But by my Spirit,&quot; that's what the Lord says</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS: Witness? ah-. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Can I GET A WITNESS, ah. Yeah,yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (repeat)</segment5>
		<segment6>I believe God is calling you my friend. To shake your world upside-down and back again. Might be a hundred you might just be a little kid. But you can slay giants just the way that David did</segment6>
		<segment7>I remember times when it was difficult. And I prayed that God would send a miracle. I don't know how but right up to the very end. He made a way outta' &quot;no-way&quot; and show 'nuff delivered</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Sling shot in my back pocket track. Bumpin with a rocket. Battle rocks by my side. Ready for appocolypse. Even these inventions unseen but heard. Not by power or might but by my spirit says the Word</segment9>
		<segment10>And who can be against us if you for us(nobody). And who can shut us down if you with us(nobody). And who can stop a thing that you started(nobody). If you with us, put 'em up and be a witness</segment10>
		<segment11>Chorus    </segment11>
