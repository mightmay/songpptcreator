		<segment1>I used to close my eyes and pray the time would pass me by. So I could fly away in my dreams to anywhere unreal. And I'd hide away from everything. I didn't know what was real, I didn't know the truth. There was a day when somebody introduced me to You. And You breathed Your life in me. You set me free.. </segment1>
		<segment2>[Refrain:]. Now I'll shout it from a mountain. That I'm not the same that I used to be. I believe in God, believe in God. I'm not ashamed to talk about it. To a world that slowly slips away. That I believe in God, believe in God </segment2>
		<segment3>Now at the end of the day when nothing seems to go my way. I've got a friend, I've got a life that's never gonna let me go. Since You gave Your life for me. You set me free.. </segment3>
		<segment4>[Refrain] </segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, when I feel so alone. He comes to sweetly say. It's all gonna be okay. Oh, when my emotions flow. He comes to sweetly say. It's all gonna be okay </segment5>
		<segment6>[Refrain]    </segment6>
