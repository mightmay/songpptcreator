		<segment1>Walk in the flame again, I'll be there to hold your hand, Keeping you safe until the end. And when the flood begins, I'll be there with you to stand, Walking in faith until the end</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I see you through the flood, I'll see you through the fire, See you through the storms-a-raging.</segment2>
		<segment3>Walking the darkest rain. I'll cover you by my name, I'm shelter inside your world of pain. Step on the waters waves. Come unto to me by faith. I am the light of better days</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I see you through the flood, I'll see you through the fire, I see you through, the storms are raging</segment5>
		<segment6>don't be afraid. I'll never leave you. I am forever yours</segment6>
		<segment7>Forever yours. Forever yours I am     </segment7>
