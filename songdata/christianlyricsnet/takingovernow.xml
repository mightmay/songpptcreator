		<segment1>VERSE 1. Every morning I wake up just to find. Never-ending mercies You made mine. I can't deny the joy inside. You set my world in motion God. And I can't stop spinning</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Jesus You lift me up so high. Above all the things that I. Could not ever seem to leave behind. Now with You I cannot be stopped. You are living in my heart. Your life is taking over all of me now. You're taking over now</segment2>
		<segment3>VERSE 2. All around the world let people sing. Of a God who set the captives free. Salvation is forever Yours. I won't stay silent anymore. And I can't stop singing.     </segment3>
