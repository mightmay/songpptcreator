		<segment1>speak. and say the words that no one else will ever say. love. love like the world we know is over in a day</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: i'm gonna show you love in every language. i'm gonna speak with words that need no form. i'm gonna give you what you never had before</segment2>
		<segment3>and you're beautiful. and i am weakened by the force of your eyes. so shine bright. to separate the truth from the lies. i'm gonna show you love</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>what you never had before. had before</segment5>
		<segment6>so tie me to a tree and let the smoke and ash collect. no, i won't regret to let love do what love will let. and you can drown in mixed emotions and walk across an angry sea. this is the cost of being free</segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS x 2]</segment7>
		<segment8>i'm gonna show you love, love in every language. i'm gonna show you love you never had before. i'm gonna show you love, love in every language. i'm gonna show you love you never had before. i'm gonna show you love.     </segment8>
