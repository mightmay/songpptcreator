		<segment1>all these expectations drain my life what am i to do i feel like i just want to brake in two i can't be everything what's a matter with failure take my hand and understand drifting off to a better place i check these thoughts and the worries fade away as they distance themselves from my life i can see for the first time unspoken unbrokeness has left me longing and wanting more looking back it's all faded away living my life now day to day i will always be here trying to stop living my life for you alone    </segment1>
