		<segment1>I couldn't have stopped it or stayed awake. Now caught in the rafters to veil a trace</segment1>
		<segment2>You covered a vision, it's all I had. Now drink to your poison to feel the stab. Ticking like a time bomb, ticking like a time bomb</segment2>
		<segment3>I landed  here to breathe. I landed here to breathe. But I never felt this strange</segment3>
		<segment4>Await for an inlay to monitor. But notice that my hands shake and my vision blurred. Dimming till the lights off, dimming till the lights off    </segment4>
