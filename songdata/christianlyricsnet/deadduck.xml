		<segment1>The ideal for the practical. The exchange: freedom for truth. The path you set out on.. Someone will finish it. But it will not be you. (Why don't you fly? Why aren't you alive?)</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause you're a Dead Duck. You dug the hole that you've fallen into. Your lost hopes and Broken Dreams</segment2>
		<segment3>Fallen away, should have fallen asleep. Dark is your path, can't see what stumbles your feet. Seduced by the times you who once were an heir. Our joys should all be doubled and our trials be shared. (If I saw you cry, would you too want me to die?)</segment3>
		<segment4>You are not alone it seems    </segment4>
