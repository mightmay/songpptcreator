		<segment1>Sometimes I get that overwhelming feeling. So sad those faces on tv. If I tried to make a difference would it hello anyway. But then I stop and to myself I say</segment1>
		<segment2>So you wanna change the world. What are you waiting for. You say you're gonna start right now. What are you waiting for. It only takes once voice. So come on now and shout it out. Give a little more. What are you waiting for</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes I feel a little helpless. Seems like I can't do a thing. But anything is possible just you wait and see. Good things happen if you just believe</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>Someday somehow. Gonna take that step. Cause time is ticking away</segment5>
		<segment6>Right here right now. Before it's too late. Gonna face tomorrow today</segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus]    </segment7>
