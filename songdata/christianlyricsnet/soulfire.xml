		<segment1>Every morning as I wake to another day. I bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray. I search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find. Running circles in the mazes deep inside my mind. You always take me to a higher level. Show something that's deep inside. You show me things I never knew</segment1>
		<segment2>You push me you pull me</segment2>
		<segment3>You set my soul on fire. You take me so much higher. Higher again. Thank you for it all</segment3>
		<segment4>Everyday living this life not knowing what it means. Consolation from above fulfilling all my dreams. And as I look across the crowd in their eyes I see. All their troubles and their pain staring back at me. You always take me to a higher level. You show me something that's deep inside. You show me things I never knew. You push me you pull me</segment4>
		<segment5>You always give the best for me. Lift your hands high right where I can see. You always give the best for me. Lift your hands high right where I can see    </segment5>
