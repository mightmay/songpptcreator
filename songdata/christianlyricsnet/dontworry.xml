		<segment1>On the corner of Fifth and Broadway. I was walking to the grocery store on Third. I saw a man up on a box. He seemed a little unorthodox. He was preaching up a storm. As I passed on by he said </segment1>
		<segment2>Don't worry about your life. Cause if you hold it too close. You'll lose it. Don't worry about your life. So won't you let go. Before it's gone </segment2>
		<segment3>A little further on I saw a beggar on the street. He asked for change and then gives me his life story. Says he was a millionaire, made some bad decisions there. Now a dollar fifty could feed him for a week. And he said </segment3>
		<segment4>Don't worry about your life. Cause if you hold it too close you lose it. Don't worry about your life. So won't you let go. Before it's gone </segment4>
		<segment5>Then I see the birds. I watch them fly. They've got everything they need. They show me why I can be free. Knowing You will care for me </segment5>
		<segment6>Finally at the grocery store. My mind is filled with many thoughts. As I bump into a girl I knew from high school. She said &quot;What's different about you girl?&quot;. And I smiled and said this is what I know is true. And I'll pass it right along to you </segment6>
		<segment7>Don't worry about your life. Cause if you hold it too close you lose it. Don't worry about your life. So won't you let go before it's gone.     </segment7>
