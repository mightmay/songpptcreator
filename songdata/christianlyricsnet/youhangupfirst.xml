		<segment1>She was the girl that I dreamed I could go with. Her bangs were 3 feet high off her forehead. She had a blond perm freckles on her nose and. A long pink shirt that goes with her pro keds. I was the little nerd that girls never noticed. I'm pretty sure that my situation hopeless. My thought occurred when I chose and I wrote this. If you'll go out with me check the box yes. I passed the note then I waited for the moment. I saw her hold it flip it up and fold it. She passed it back and I got it opened. She checked yes and I was like Oh yeah!. Gave me her number and she told me to call her. And that night we like talked for an hr. Go to bed is what I heard from her father. She had to hang up so I told her saying. </segment1>
		<segment2>You hang up first (uh uh I aint hanging up first). I aint hanging up first you hang up first. You hang up first (uh uh I aint hanging up first). I aint hanging up first you hang up first. Alright ok enuffs enuff. On the count of three we gone both hang up. It goes 3 2 two to the 1. You still there whats up..</segment2>
		<segment3>Next day see I'm feeling like the man. So I catch up to her while she heading to her class. Walked up to her and I tried to hold her hand. But she turned and walked way I just don't understand. But then she did what only girls can. 5 little words that will crush every man. Now on a note that was written in a pink pen. It said I just wanna be friends. I was like aight uh that's ok. Girl I didn't even like you anway. I was gonna break up with you anyday. Then she turned around and I ran down hallway. Later on I found out the reason that she dumped me. She kissed another dude when she was at the movies. Went home broke down cried all day. And to think we used to say.</segment3>
		<segment4>I went home ripped her pictures out my yearbook. So that when I saw her I wouldn't have to tear up. Now thank God now my number never came up. I would call her then I would hang up. That's how it goes when ya get dumped. I told all my bros we just broke up. But years later this email shows up. Most of the time I would've been like so what. She hit me up on my myspace. Said she saw my cd and recognized my face. The whole thing now was really really quite strange. I had to think back about how much that I'd changed. It's cuz of Christ now that I came. So far in life and as I look back on that day. I realize how much grace that God gave. But back then this the only thing I would say    </segment4>
