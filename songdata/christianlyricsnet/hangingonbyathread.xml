		<segment1>Verse 1. My past has followed me and. I just can't get away. I'm not the same as I was. Leaving my disarray</segment1>
		<segment2>Take me just as I am. I'm broken down. Pull me into Your arms. I'm hanging on to every word</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Save me from losing myself. I'm hanging on by a thread. Can You see who I am. Underneath my scars?. I'm afraid to fall. So I'm holding on to You. Know I won't let go. I'm hanging on by a thread</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2. I still can hardly believe. The person I once was. I'm trying so hard to change. Help me work through my flaws</segment4>
		<segment5>Take me just as I am. I'm calling out. Pull me into Your arms. I'm hanging on to every breath</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge. I'll never need. I'll never want. With You with me. I'm so complete. I'll never run. I'll never hide. With You right here I'm safe inside</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus    </segment8>
