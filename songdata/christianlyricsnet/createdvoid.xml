		<segment1>Lets do this for each other. Lets do this for truth. I give for you, you give for me. Let me take you somewhere, I can not explain. Im stumbling right in front of you now. I wont refrain from guiding you there. Normal is not so far. Was it just a dream. Or something much more. We are not alone. Since you agreed to follow. Its all in my head, if you want, you can look inside. Theres nothing but red and all the mess Ive been. Its all in the way I say what I dont mean, and mean what I dont. I need to speak of you and what is real. They will never understand. What eats at our insides.     </segment1>
