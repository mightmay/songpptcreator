		<segment1>When i made up my mind. And my heart along with that. To live not for myself. But yet for god, somebody said. Do you know what you are getting yourself into</segment1>
		<segment2>When i finally ironed out. All of my priorities. And asked god to remove the doubt. That makes me so unsure of these. Things i ask myself, i ask myself. Do you know what you are getting yourself into</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. I'm getting into you. Because you got to me, in a way words can't describe. I'm getting into you. Because i've got to be. You're essential to survive. I'm going to love you with my life</segment3>
		<segment4>When he looked at me and said. I kind of view you as a son. And for a second our eyes met. And i met that with a question. Do you know what you are getting yourself into</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus]</segment5>
		<segment6>I've been a liar and i'll never amount to. The kind of person you deserve to worship you. You say you will not dwell on what i did but rather what i do you say. I love you and that's what you are getting yourself into</segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus]</segment7>
		<segment8>He said, i love you and that's what you are getting yourself into    </segment8>
