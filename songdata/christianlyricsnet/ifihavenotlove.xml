		<segment1>Jesus I could sing. In the tongues of men and angels. But if I have not love. I am just a clanging cymbal, and empty sound. 2x</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: This is a love song. This is a love song. Jesus, a love song to You. A song of devotion, a reverent passion. Savior, a love song to You</segment2>
		<segment3>Jesus, I could pray. With a faith that moves a mountain. But if I have not love. It is just a noise resounding, an empty sound. 2x</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus 2x. This is a love song to You. Hear our devotion</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>It's the overflow of hearts. As we gaze upon Your beauty. A reflection of Your worth. For we've seen a glimpse of You in Your glory, Lord    </segment6>
