		<segment1>Im so tired of politics. And all this bad news. Im so tired of chasing the moment. Instead of chasing you</segment1>
		<segment2>I let the world wear me down. Im desensitized. Jesus, keep my heart alive. Keep my heart alive. Only you can save me from a world thats breaking right before my eyes. Keep my heart alive</segment2>
		<segment3>Take these empty hallelujahs. Fill my lungs again. Cuz I wanna sing. And I wanna mean it. I wanna feel again</segment3>
		<segment4>And let the world hear the sound of something about. Jesus, keep my heart alive. Keep my heart alive. Only You can save me when my world is breaking right before my eyes. Jesus, keep my heart alive. Keep my heart alive. Only You can save me when my hope is fading and Im losing the fight</segment4>
		<segment5>And when the world wears me down. Youre my lifes love. You keep my heart alive. Oh, yeah!!. Jesus, keep my heart alive. Keep my heart alive. Only You can save me when my world is breaking right before my eyes. Keep my heart alive. Oh, keep my heart alive. Youre my only hope when my world is fading before my eyes. Jesus, keep my heart alive. Keep my heart alive    </segment5>
