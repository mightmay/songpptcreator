		<segment1>the lines been drawn as the heart is torn the dilemma grows too thick surmounting evidence points to one it's all true but makes you sick everything you once believed are lies traditions values morals don't comply so many options confusing paths everyone says they're right why can't all paths lead to one who is right who is right the soul is on a quest discerning fact from fiction is the test step inside the room come and see what know lays in front of you then you will know what truth is in your life the more you run the heavier you become you feel the tug yet resistance has you won just let go of all your worries just let go just let go.     </segment1>
