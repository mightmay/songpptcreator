		<segment1>Got a call from my old friend. Said she fell in love again. But there's one thing she should know. Real true love will only grow. Grow like flowers from the rain. Mystery I can't explain. But this one thing I can do is lay out the facts for you</segment1>
		<segment2>True love is faithful. Like Spring in April. It is as dependable as time. And it is able. To hold on and survive. When other loves might say goodbye</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. If you wanna step to me. You better know one thing. This love I got you'll never get. Without a wedding ring. (Repeat)</segment3>
		<segment4>Friend called back said can it be. I love him, him love me. But he said he'll never wed. Rather play the field instead. Feilds of taller grassy green. Kind you find in magazines. Well I said if that be so. By all means then let him go</segment4>
		<segment5>True love is faithful. Like Spring in April. It is as dependable as time. And it is able. To hold on and survive. When other loves might say goodbye</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>A to the B to the B to the C. Elementary fundamentals is the way you found me. I was lost, lost as could be. Also blind but now I see</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>What I got is priceless. What I got is special. What I got is precious. (repeat 4 times). What I got is priceless!    </segment9>
