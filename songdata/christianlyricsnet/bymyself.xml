		<segment1>Cornered at a costume ball. By a handful of disguises. So I tried them all on. And they were all the right sizes. I wore them obviously. Though they would choke the life from me</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I got here by myself but. I know that I will never leave the same way. I got here by myself but. How many more will I have led astray</segment2>
		<segment3>I work the floor in search of someone. Who would give me half a chance. I know if I look hard enough. I'll always find someone who'll dance</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>It's not long before I notice. There are no doors to be seen. I can see I'm going nowhere. Somewhere that I've already been</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus 2x)    </segment6>
