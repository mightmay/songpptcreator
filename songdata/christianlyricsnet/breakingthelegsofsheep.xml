		<segment1>I never meant to hurt you. I never thought my words could cut right through, leaving open wounds. In all this open space, I took myself into a place. I never should have gone, I never should have gone. Oh, the damage is done. Lay me down in fields of green. This heart has seen things I never should have seen. you're breaking my legs and teaching me. I never saw my own pride. I never thought my lips could taste of lies, and kiss your crying eyes. And all the scars you've gained, from crimson covered hands. That held your face when they were strong, my hands used to be so strong. Oh the damage they've done. I found my place amont the seas, I found this grace upon my knees    </segment1>
