		<segment1>Many things in life are hard for me. Many things can pull us down. I don't understand why I do what I do. How could I take my eyes off you. After all You've done for me. And after all You've done for me </segment1>
		<segment2>It's by Your grace and love I am saved. It's by Your grace and love You've forgiven me. And by that love and grace I'm amazed. It's by Your grace and love I am free. I am free, I am free, I am free </segment2>
		<segment3>And it's by grace and love that I am free. I'll live with You eternally. I thank you Lord that I am free. I thank You Lord for loving me. I thank You Lord for dying upon the tree of Calvary. I thank You Lord for loving me. I thank You Lord for dying for me </segment3>
		<segment4>Because it's by grace and love I am saved. It's by Your grace and love You've forgiven me. And by that love and grace, I'm amazed. It's by Your grace and love I am free. I am free, I am free, I am free </segment4>
		<segment5>Many things in life are hard for me. Many things can pull us down. But by grace and love You've forgiven me. And by grace and love we are free    </segment5>
