		<segment1>Enemy, familiar friend. My beginning and my end. Knowing truth, whispering lies. And it hurts again</segment1>
		<segment2>What I fear and what I've tried, Words I say and what I hide. All the pain, I want it to end. But I want it again</segment2>
		<segment3>And it finds me. The fight inside is coursing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is breaking me again</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm still the same, pursuing pain. Is it worth all that I've gained?. We both know how this will end, But I'd do it again</segment4>
		<segment5>And it finds me. The fight inside is coursing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is hurting me again</segment5>
		<segment6>And it finds me. The war within me pulls me under. And without You. The fight inside is breaking me again</segment6>
		<segment7>It's everything (It's nothing). It's everything (It's nothing). It's everything (It's nothing). It's everything (It's nothing)</segment7>
		<segment8>It's breaking me. It's breaking me</segment8>
		<segment9>I'm falling apart. I'm falling apart     </segment9>
