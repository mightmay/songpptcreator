		<segment1>There was a time as a little boy. When I said I'd follow you. But the years have caused the flame. To burn much stronger now. And I'm not burning down any of my bridges. But I'm burning up inside. To flee from my religion and love my. neighbour more</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm not ashamed of the gospel. I'm not ashamed of the one I love. I'm not ashamed of the gospel. I'm not ashamed of the one I love</segment2>
		<segment3>There were times in my barreness. When I felt your pure affection. And you heard my frail petitions. To serve you endlessly. But have I loved the tree they put you on?. Or my friend who met me at the cross?. Oh I want to sing again for my brother. And find my way down this mountain</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm not ashamed anymore. cos I've felt the oil pour down over me. And there's a fire that's burning stronger now. It's burning stronger much stronger. For you only for you    </segment4>
