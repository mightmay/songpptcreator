		<segment1>Walk backwards. Say goodbye to what's right. Understanding what makes this, what makes us, what makes us right. God save this gun slinging generation. &quot;Tell God I will return in the morning.&quot;. This Christ you preach, I know, but who are you?. Your hands are tied to blind men, whose hands are tied to blind men. Figure eights. This pistol is my ministry.     </segment1>
