		<segment1>Look inside, the autumn leaves are falling. Deep inside you hear the road is calling. And I know you want to walk away. And leave it all behind. You're running from nothing. Chasing lies can find you tired and jaded. And in your world the colors have all faded. If you think that you can find a place. To get away from the pain. You're looking for nothing</segment1>
		<segment2>I hate to see you leave without a fight</segment2>
		<segment3>Time will open doors for you. Wishes spent make dreams come true. I promise I'll be there. Don't say goodbye</segment3>
		<segment4>Take my hand, let's walk a while together. Holding hands won't make love last forever. But I know you probably need someone. To help you work it out. You've gotta do something    </segment4>
