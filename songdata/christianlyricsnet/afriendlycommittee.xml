		<segment1>Many Men have battled, Many more will fall, Underneath the shadows, Our trust has fed them all, In the heart of every city, At the front of every war, Support the great committee, Because we're all done for!. Stand up or you will fall. (Spiral down till you hit the ground, for this condition, we sing out loud). We love to point our fingers, We talk so much of change, But do we have the answers, To even turn the page,</segment1>
		<segment2>So many of us hurting, We beg of this to end, So many of us dying, This message we will, Stand up or you will fall. (Spiral down till you hit the ground, for this condition, we sing out loud). Stand up or you will fall. Stand up or you will fall     </segment2>
