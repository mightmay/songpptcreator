		<segment1>Looked out my window last night. From my pillow and I. Saw the willow weeping a casual sigh. The man in the moon looked rather. Sad and confused as if he'd. Become a mirror to my watery eyes. I dreamed and prayed through the night. &quot;Please send some grace with Your morning light.&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>Then He sent you along like a summer day. With a blue-sky smile on your funny face. And a bird flew by singing &quot;Everything's gonna be okay!&quot;, yeah. So we laughed all day with the man in the moon. And we thanked the Good Lord for the afternoon. 'Cause He showed me His love by sending me you. And it's okay, now. Everything's okay</segment2>
		<segment3>I open my window tonight. Hear the rain falling light. Whispering that everything is alright. A long, low, and gentle rumble. Starts in the west and tumbles. Across the corners of the colorless sky. I blow a kiss through the dark. Sails on the thunder, reaches Heaven's heart</segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause He sent you along like a summer day. With a blue-sky smile on your funny face. And a bird flew by singing &quot;Everything's gonna be okay!&quot;, yeah. So we laughed all day with the man in the moon. And we thanked the Good Lord for the afternoon. 'Cause He showed me His love by sending me you. And it's okay, now. Everything's okay    </segment4>
