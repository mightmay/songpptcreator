		<segment1>If you see her out tonight. And she tells you that it's just the lights. That bring her here and not her loneliness. That's what she says but sometimes she forgets</segment1>
		<segment2>If she tells you she don't need a man. She's had all the comfort she can stand. You best believe every word she says. But don't give up 'cause sometimes she forgets</segment2>
		<segment3>And sometimes she forgets that not too long ago she swore. She wasn't gonna let her heart be broken anymore</segment3>
		<segment4>So now she keeps it locked away. And it grows colder everyday. And it won't warm to any man's caress. That's what she says but sometimes she forgets</segment4>
		<segment5>And sometimes she forgets that not too long ago she swore. She wasn't gonna let her heart be broken anymore</segment5>
		<segment6>If you see her out tonight. And she tells you that it's just the lights. That bring her here and not her loneliness. That's what she says but sometimes she forgets</segment6>
		<segment7>Yeah, that's what she says, but sometimes she forgets. So don't you dare give up 'cause sometimes she forgets    </segment7>
