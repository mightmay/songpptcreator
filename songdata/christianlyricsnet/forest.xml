		<segment1>There's a forest in my heart. No I'm not crazy. I can feel the trees. Reaching out toward the sky. But the sun is getting hard. Somehow that changes me. Maybe you have seen. How the light can leave my eyes..</segment1>
		<segment2>There's a forest in my heart. It seems so crazy. Cause I've tried to climb. Every tree that shades my mind. But with every try I find. The branches breaking. And I'm alone and cold. Like the shadows left behind..</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a forest in my heart. I must be crazy. To believe that I. Could climb to reach the sky. For I know that in its time. The sun will come to me. And in warmth and love. I will rise the above the sky..    </segment3>
