		<segment2>Cause everyday I see your face. Your beautiful green eyes. I find i love you more</segment2>
		<segment3>I have traveled this land. and I've seen a lot. There's nothing i've seen that could prepare. The deepest ocean. Fire in the sunset. iIve never seen anything like them. I saw you and they could not compare. Once again you've shown me I was wrong</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause everyday i see your face. You beautiful green eyes. I find I love you more </segment4>
