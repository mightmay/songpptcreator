		<segment1>we're all burning alive (burning alive). no one is special anymore (no one). your education assembly line (descending). cap and gown, i hope you're happy. this is not being alive, this is not life. i dare you to open your eyes. place one finger to my bottomless negativity, it only gets worse from here, it only gets worse. not a single one of you realizes you are bleeding to death, this is your utopia: a culture geared for perpetual meaningless. we offer ignorance and feeble mindedness, to idols made of stone and proclaim: &quot;we are an entire generation of injured children&quot;. screaming in a whisper &quot;someone save us from ourselves.&quot;. slit wrists. realize you are bleeding to death. realize you are bleeding.    </segment1>
