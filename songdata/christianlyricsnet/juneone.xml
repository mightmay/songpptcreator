		<segment1>side the lake and spokes go round. this way make through rusty brown. in a corner, in the shadows. and the sunlight makes the clouds glow. june one just me. orbiting at apogee. june one to remind. turn it over, over in time. at the end of these white walls. I pretend the still life calls. through the waters, under bridges. for a moment I could swear that you looked at me    </segment1>
