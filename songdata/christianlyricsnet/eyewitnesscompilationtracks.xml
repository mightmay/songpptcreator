		<segment1>Invalid steps bring you closer to what a single lost cause that grants you nothing count the cost and pay the price or watch your dreams drown all around you fool you tie your own hands no hope for redemption reality will find you bind you and grind you face the facts it's what you lack that you're running from now eyewithness everyday how you throw it all away i set my sights i break these chains of this world i walk no more you tie your own hands break free stand up from the dust to see what i can see i can barely stand to watch you i won't walk alone no more.     </segment1>
