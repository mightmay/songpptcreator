		<segment1>I look the part. blend in with the rest of the church crowd. I know the routine. I could list all the bible studies in town. watch christian TV. I know all the preachers..their cliches. been born again, without a doubt I know I'm saved</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. But sometimes I hurt and sometimes I cry. sometimes I can't get it right. no matter how hard I seem to try. sometimes I fall down. stumble over my own disguise. I try to look strong. as the whole world looks on. but sometimes alone I cry</segment2>
		<segment3>I try to speak faith. never give the devil one inch to get in. I do worship and praise. let everybody know just where that I stand. on the back of my ride is a fish and a cross. for the world to see. I know God is good, all of the time. yes there's no doubt for me</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. But sometimes I hurt and sometimes I cry. sometimes I can't get it right. no matter how hard I seem to try. sometimes I fall down. stumble over my own disguise. I try to look strong. as the whole world looks on. but sometimes alone I cry</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Sometimes I fall down. stumble over my own disguise. I try to look strong as the whole world looks on. but sometimes alone I cry</segment5>
		<segment6>Tag. I try to look strong as the whole world looks on. but sometimes alone I cry.     </segment6>
