		<segment1>Waitin, waitin. Ohhhh</segment1>
		<segment2>I know how it feels to be. Just another face in the crowd. To feel like a whisper. In a world thats much too loud. Tryin to find a place to fit in. A dream where u don't understand. And where your dreams begin</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Don't let it pull you down. Don't let it turn you around. Don't ever forget whose child you are. Though others may fail to see. The diamond that lies beneath. He knows just how priceless you are. While you're waiting in the wings</segment3>
		<segment4>Underestimated. By everyone that passes you by. Lookin up from the bottom. Like a flower thats reachin for the sky. Waitin for the sun to break through. Waitin for the chance for it. To shine down on you</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. I see you standin behind the curtain. Listening to everyone's applause. But remember the first shall be last. And the last shall be first. In the eyes of God    </segment6>
