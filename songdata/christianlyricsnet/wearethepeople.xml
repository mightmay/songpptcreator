		<segment1>every one of us wants to make a difference. so we try to find a way to say the things we feel. and every one of us feels a righteous anger. but its not about the fight. and its not about whos wrong or right. . CHORUS. we are the people. God has called us in this hour to be a shining light. throughout the darkest night. we are the people. and the way we make a change is only. by the way we live our lives. we are the people of the Light. . we were never meant to carry all of the burden. we can never force a change in a world that goes its way. but if we open up to the power of His Spirit. then the mountains will move and the glory of God will shine through. . we are the people. God has called us in this hour to be a shining light. throughout the darkest night. we are the people. and the way we make a change is only. by the way we live our lives. . we are His hands, His hands of mercy. we are His words of peace. we are His heart of compassion. and forgiveness. only in Christ we meet their need. . chorus</segment1>
