		<segment1>In You I will find my peace. In You I will find my strength. Youre the one that lifts my head. I will not be ashamed.. ashamed.</segment1>
		<segment2>All I have is in You, all I need is from You. Lift up my eyes. You have put the joy thats in my heart. Lift up my voice. For in You is where I find hope. Lift up my eyes. You have put the joy thats in my heart. Lift up my voice. For in You is where I find hope.</segment2>
		<segment3>Let them ever sing for joy, and may you shelter them, that those who love Your name may exalt in You.. You.. in You.</segment3>
		<segment4>Youre wonderful. Im powerless in Your arms. Youve shown me love in the surrounds of hate, and restored my strength, and I proclaim my life is Yours. So break my will, and surely not in vain. I keep my life pure for great is my reward.    </segment4>
