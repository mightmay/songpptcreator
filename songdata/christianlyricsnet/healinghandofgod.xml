		<segment1>I have seen the many faces, . I fear in the pain. . I have watched the tears fall plenty, . From heart ache and strength. . So if life's journey, Has you weary and afraid. . There's rest in the shadow of his wings. . I have walked through the valleys, . The mountains and plains. . I have held the hand of freedom, . It washes all my stains. . If you feel the weight of many trials, . And burdens from this world. . There's freedom in the shelter of the Lord. . . [Chorus:] . I have seen, . The Healing Hand Of God, . Reaching out and mending broken hearts. . Taste and see the fullness of His peace, . And hold on to what's being held out. . The healing hand of God. . . I have touched the scars upon His hands, . To see if they were real. . He has walked the road before me, . He knows just how I feel. . When you feel there is not anyone, . Who understands your pain, . Just remember all of Jesus' suffering. . . [Chorus] . . Cast all your cares on Him, . For He cares for you. . He's near to the broken and confused. . By His stripes, . Our spirit is renewed. . So enter in the joy prepared for you. . . [Chorus] . . The healing hand of God [x2] . And hold on to what's being held out [x2] . The healing hand of God . Oh Oh Oh Oh      </segment1>
