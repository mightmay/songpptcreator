		<segment1>Come a little closer to see the walls you're breaking down. Come a little closer to see the claws you're breaking out. I don't wanna see you drown. I don't wanna see you drown. All of my life I've been pulling you out of the water. Oh, the waves keep you under. Tonight tonight could be the greatest night of all your life. Tonight tonight could be the greatest night of all your life. Put away your potion. Put away your potion. You're just a man who's cursed with doubt. Put away your potion, put away your potion. You are the plague of man, but you are the found. All of my life I've been pulling you out of the water. Oh, the waves keep you under. Tonight tonight could be the greatest night of all your life. Tonight tonight could be the greatest night of all your life. Tonight tonight could be the greatest night of all your life. Tonight tonight could be the greatest night of all your life.     </segment1>
