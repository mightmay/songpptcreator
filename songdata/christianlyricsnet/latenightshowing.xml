		<segment1>When I look at all that has been given to me, I'm so grateful for all that we've shared. I can't imagine living life without you. Where would I be if you didn't care?. I know I'm truly blessed to have you in my life. I wish I could give back as much as you have given me. You're there for me when I wake up. You're there for me when I fall asleep. Sometimes I don't act how I should, but you still love me. I wish I could do more to show you my respect. I wish I could do more.     </segment1>
