		<segment1>When youve been wounded, deeply wounded by a friend. You wonder when, if ever, you will trust again. When youve been broken, deeply broken by a man. You wonder when, if ever, you will love again</segment1>
		<segment2>Truth be told Im not quite sure when things went right. But the darkest tunnel always has a distant light. And Ive arrived, yes Ive arrived and right on time. You were there to greet me arms stretched open wide. You were there to meet me on the other side</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I believe in something its been a long time coming. It may not mean that much to you but it means all the world to me. Im belonging somewhere it took me time to get here. But now that Ive become a part of you I never want to leave</segment3>
		<segment4>When youve been hurting, deeply hurting all alone. You wonder when, if ever, you will find a home. When youve been searching, endless searching for the truth. You wonder when, if ever, it will search for you. You wonder if someone will ever search for you     </segment4>
