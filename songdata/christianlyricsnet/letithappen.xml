		<segment1>I want someone to love. A girl that when I think of. Will put a smile on my face. I want to hold her hand. Want her to understand. There's got to be a better place </segment1>
		<segment2>Than this world cause this. Is the best time of our lives. Should I be thinking about that now. She turns my world around. I let it happen everytime </segment2>
		<segment3>I want a lot of things. Selfishness always seem to bring. All the pain back in my mind. Which way to go. Answers to questions I don't know. There's better things that we can find    </segment3>
