		<segment1>Ive been to the Garden. Breathed the sweetest air. Alive and wanting more. Ate the fruit and honey. Ive tasted the sweetest sweet. I am full on life</segment1>
		<segment2>So come on, come on now. Lets run together. Come on, come on now. Lets get together</segment2>
		<segment3>To life, to love. To life, to love</segment3>
		<segment4>I am addicted. I need more life from You. Dont let me suffocate. I need You closer. I wanna feel new wine now. Flowing through my veins</segment4>
