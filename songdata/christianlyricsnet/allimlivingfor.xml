		<segment1>Here I am waiting for You, Here I am reaching out to You, I will run into Your arms again, And Im longing for Your touch once again,</segment1>
		<segment2>Take my life, everything, All I am, An offering for you, Cause youre all Im living for</segment2>
		<segment3>Here I am waiting on You, Here I am reaching out for You, I will run into Your arms again, And Im longing for Your touch once again,</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]. Take my life, everything, All I am, An offering for you, Cause youre all Im living for. Take my heart, all of me, Im laying it down, to worship You my God. Cause Youre all Im living for,</segment4>
		<segment5>I will run into Your open arms, To your love, that washes away my fears. I am found, deep in this mystery, Cause Youre all Im living for</segment5>
