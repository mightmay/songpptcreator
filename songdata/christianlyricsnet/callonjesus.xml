		<segment1>Verse 1: I'm so very ordinary, nothing special on my own. Oh, I have never walked on water, And I have never calmed a storm. Sometimes I'm hiding away from the madness around me. Like a child who's afraid of the dark</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: But when I call on Jesus, All things are possible. I can mount on wings like eagles' and soar. When I call on Jesus, Mountains are gonna fall. 'Cause He'll move heaven and earth to come rescue me when I call</segment2>
		<segment3>La la la la la, la la la la la</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: Weary brother, broken daughter, Widowed, Widowed lover you're not alone. If you're tired and scared of the madness around you. If you can't find the strength to carry on</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: When you call on Jesus, All things are possible. You can mount on wings like eagles' and soar. When you call on Jesus, Mountains are gonna fall. 'Cause He'll move heaven and earth to come rescue you when you--</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge: Call Him in the morning', in the afternoon time. Late in the evening' He'll be there. When your heart is broken, And you feel discouraged, You can just remember that He said. He'll be there</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus (2x): When I call on Jesus, All things are possible. I can mount on wings like eagles' and soar. When I call on Jesus, Mountains are gonna fall. 'Cause He'll move heaven and earth to come rescue me (back to top first time, 2nd time finish with &quot;when I call&quot;)</segment7>
		<segment8>La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la-a-a.     </segment8>
