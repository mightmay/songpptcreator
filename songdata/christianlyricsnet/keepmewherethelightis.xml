		<segment1>I have walked through the valley.                                              . Stood on the mountain top.           . I have held on to You.                                                       . As my treasure, my truth and my rock.            . I have sung with the angels </segment1>
		<segment2>And heard You speak into my heart.       . IÂ’m giving myself to become.                         . More like You are.                             . So keep me where the light is. I want to be where You are.               . Want to live for my life to find its place in Your heart. I have walked through the valley. Stood on the mountain top. I have held on to You. As my treasure, my truth and my rock. I confess there are times. When I stray from the line. But I want to be true and lay everything down. 'Cause what do I have in this world. If I don't have You    </segment2>
