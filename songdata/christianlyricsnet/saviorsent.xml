		<segment1>V1Tried and True, Mercy New, Lord I put my Hope in you, Wild and free, perfect peace, always bring me to my kneesStars and Sun, faithful one, you hold fast, I come undoneGod and Friend, without End, There's no wound that you can not mendPre:I don't know where you're leading meBut I know it's where I want to beMy mind is filled with mysteries of your love, of your love, of your loveI don't know how to unlock me, but I know that you hold every keyMy heart's still filled with mysteries, of your love, of your love, of your loveChorus:You are Father, and You are Savior Sent and You are spirit here right nowYour like no other and You are the hope of agesYou are alive and here right now V2:Doubt and Fears, timid tears, I bring to you and you draw nearYou Hold and Kiss brokenness, you say my child I died for this.Bridge:So you leave the ninety-nine, and you search the ends of earth for one just oneHow could I have been so blind, Now I know that your the One. The only One.      </segment1>
