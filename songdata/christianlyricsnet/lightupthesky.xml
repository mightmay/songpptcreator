		<segment1>When Im feeling all alone and so far to go. The signs are nowhere on this road guiding me home. When the night is closing in. Its falling on my skin. Oh God will You come close</segment1>
		<segment2>Light, light, light up the sky. Light up the sky to show me You are with me. I, I, I cant deny. Oh I cant deny that You are right here with me. Youve opened my eyes so I can see You all around me. Light, light, light up the sky. Light up the sky to show me You are with me</segment2>
		<segment3>When stars are hiding in the clouds. I dont feel them shining. When I cant see beyond my doubt. The silver lining. When Ive almost reached the end. Like a flood Youre rushing in. Love is rushing in</segment3>
		<segment4>Light, light, light up the sky. Light up the sky to show me You are with me. I, I, I cant deny. Oh I cant deny that You are right here with me. Youve opened my eyes so I can see You all around me. Light, light, light up the sky. Light up the sky to show me You are with me</segment4>
		<segment5>So I run straight to Your arms. Youre the bright and morning Sun. To show Your love, theres nothing You wont do</segment5>
		<segment6>Light, light, light up the sky. You light up the sky to show me You are with me. I, I, I cant deny. Oh I cant deny that You are right here with me. Youve opened my eyes so I can see You all around me. Light, light, light up the sky. Light up the sky to show me You are with me</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh oh oh oh oh oh. You are with me. Oh oh oh oh oh oh. You are with me. Oh oh oh oh oh oh     </segment7>
