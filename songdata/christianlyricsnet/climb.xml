		<segment1>Life is like a mighty mountain rising to the sky. With every step the challenge never stops. Conviction defies gravity and fear is left behind. Faith is going to take us to the top</segment1>
		<segment2>The climb, we're reaching for eternal love. The climb, we're pressing towards the prize above. It's the pursuit to touch the face of God. The journey of a lifetime, the climb</segment2>
		<segment3>There will be stumbling blocks lying in the way. And tests of faith along the paths we choose. We can rest in knowing we cannot be lead astray. Following the stepping stones of truth</segment3>
		<segment4>Past the cliffs of darkness. Across every ridge of doubt. We will discover what life is all about    </segment4>
