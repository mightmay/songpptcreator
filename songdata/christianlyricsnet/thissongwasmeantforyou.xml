		<segment1>Where did I go wrong?. Tell me what I have done here. It didn't take too long. For the sun to disappear. And now it's gone and I'm alone</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: This song was meant for you. It had a happy ending. But you had to change your mind. And I don't know what happened. I Thought that you would never leave. Is a song forever. Life for you will surely change. Maybe for the better</segment2>
		<segment3>None of this turned out. Quite the way I had planned it. But I know that in the end. It will work out for the best. Still you're gone. And I'm alone</segment3>
		<segment4>chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>You never know what the future holds for you. But of all I have heard this one thing's true. Nothing can separate us from God's love. In our lives there is bound to come some pain. Surely as there are storms and falling rain. Just believe that the one who holds the storms. Will bring the sun</segment5>
		<segment6>chorus.     </segment6>
