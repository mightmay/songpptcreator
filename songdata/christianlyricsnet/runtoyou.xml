		<segment1>Sometimes when the world. Gets so cold. And my heart. Is fifteen below. And I feel like I'm. So far from home. I run to You</segment1>
		<segment2>When life doesn't. Go like I plan. So confused and. I don't understand. It's hard 'cause. It's out of my hands. And this is what I do. When I got. Nothing left to give</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I run to You. When I can't find my way. And I get lost in You. When I don't have the faith. When I don't know what to do. I feel I can't make it through. I run to You</segment3>
		<segment4>So it goes, every life has some rain. Everyone's gotta deal with the pain. But I know how to make it ok. I tell You what I do. When my back's. Up to the wall You know</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>You are my light. You're my everything. In a place of chaos You're the. One thing that brings me peace. I'll give my heart, I'll give my all. When I'm beat down. You're always standing tall</segment6>
		<segment7>I run to You. I'm so lost in You. When I need You. Oh I need to</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
