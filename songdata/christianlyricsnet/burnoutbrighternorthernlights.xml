		<segment1>Live; I wanna live inspired. Die; I wanna die for something. </segment1>
		<segment2>Racing towards the heavens, I fell into a pitch black. I'm moments from landing, and I'm shaking like a heart attack. </segment2>
		<segment3>Lose no time; cannot survive. I made mistakes in the past. Need a chance; can't take it back. Wish I could set things right tonight. </segment3>
		<segment4>Live; I wanna live inspired. Die; I wanna die for something higher than myself. Live and die for anyone else. The more I live I see, this life's not about me. </segment4>
		<segment5>All I know spins out of control. Wonder what's next for heart and soul. Nothing I have can save me now. Here in what maybe my final hour. </segment5>
		<segment6>It's my time, cannot survive. I made mistakes in the past. Need a chance; can't say goodbye. Wish I could set things right tonight. </segment6>
		<segment7>Live; I wanna live inspired. Die; I wanna die for something higher than myself. Live and die for anyone else. The more I live I see, this life's not about me. </segment7>
		<segment8>Don't wanna leave this world, knowing I've lived in vain. No time for myself; so sorry, so ashamed. Don't wanna leave this life, knowing I've barely tried. Chase down all my dreams that I've hid away on the inside. </segment8>
		<segment9>Live; I wanna live on fire. Die; I wanna burn out brighter. Brighter than the Northern Lights. Wanna live to feel the daylight. The more I live I see, this life's not about me.     </segment9>
