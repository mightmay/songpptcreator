		<segment1>Bitter thoughts test morals and encourage bitter action, pride comes before fall. think before you speak if you even speak at all, SPEAK AT ALL</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll relinquish your heavy hearts of pain and sorry, healing sutures. an unguarded queen pursues, oblivious of her future</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't, I don't expect anything, we are all hpeless, but i stay confident. with willingness to take control, we'll make our time well spent</segment3>
		<segment4>let it sink in, every word that i said. LET IT SINK IN, let in sink in, every word that you heard me say</segment4>
		<segment5>conquering anything and everything THROWN AT US. we will not be torn, our hearts will stand, they will stand as one (x2)</segment5>
		<segment6>WE SILL SOAR! (x3)</segment6>
		<segment7>my victory in sight, a steady heart will not collide with misfortune, oh the integrity (x2)    </segment7>
