		<segment1>Are you happy with your life?. You make just enough to scrape by. You pay the rent, and your check is spent. Where did last weekend go. You wasted all your flow and you dont. Remember where it went </segment1>
		<segment2>Drinking smoking cigarettes. Working but you're still in debt. Thinking losing self-esteem. How can this be, happening? </segment2>
		<segment3>You might have the temporary, superficial happiness. That you buy with money you don't have. Do you tell yourself, it's just the first time or maybe the last time. Which is your circumstance </segment3>
		<segment4>Life is not a job or a career. Living is not smoking and drinking beer. A gift to receive and not to take. The free thinking choice is yours to make</segment4>
		<segment5>.     </segment5>
