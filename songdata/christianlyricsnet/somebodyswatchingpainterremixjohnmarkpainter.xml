		<segment1>Suggestions, questions. People want to know. Is there life after talk. Cause there's talk on the row. Twistin' words that I've never even said. To the ones that I trust. Or my &quot;Boo&quot; in our bed. Will he make it, I bet he won't. As they're runnin' through the minutes. On their cell phones. So the picture's painted. You got the point. And that junk's creepin' into my solo joint </segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes I feel God in the middle of the night. In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS]. I always feel like somebody's watchin' me. Watch baby, watch baby, He got my back. See I'm down with the King. So I got it like that </segment3>
		<segment4>It's no joke, I've been roped in. Chokin' on a bone. From a fish in the school of your twilight zone. You shook me, took me to another place. Where the air I'm breathin's like mace in my face. If this controversy is your way. You need to know I'll never doubt my destiny. 'Cause I'm stickin' to my guns like a son of the Light. Feelin' Dad, I'm feelin' Daddy in the air tonight </segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes I feel Grace in the middle of the night. In the cool of the shade in the bright sunlight </segment5>
		<segment6>And sometimes I feel God in the midst of a show. As the palm trees sway in an afterglow </segment6>
		<segment7>[CHORUS].     </segment7>
