		<segment1>medicine tounge and a heavy hand. together made a fist. they put me down and i do not rise. and now as an old child. I'll hand it down. I'll hand it down. then blow around. see me blow around. just like dirty paper</segment1>
		<segment2>I crossed my mind. ahead of us. just there where the trees give way. do forgive. do forgive I will forget your name. far be it from me. far be it from me to take care</segment2>
		<segment3>by word of mouth. all young men do stagger. and all come to shambles by heart. we will see just as we believe no lie. time will tell us. we'll see his face and know why. did i cross your heart. behind my back just then. just then as time went marching by. I must push on. in prayer and take it by force. though you've said it. you say it better. with more conviction than I</segment3>
		<segment4>medicine tounge and a heavy hand. together made a list. row on row. of cold and hardened hearts that wish. my weeds and flowers. would together both grow wild. from a distance. from a distance. they come up close to smile    </segment4>
