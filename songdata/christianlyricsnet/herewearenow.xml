		<segment1>I ask myself what can I offer You. Can you use someone who already feels used. Have all my mistakes let you down. Can you turn my failures around</segment1>
		<segment2>Here we are now in this moment. Here we are. You are my hope when I'm broken. I am at the end of myself. Here we are. this is the start of a new life. Like a child breathing this air for the first time. I am made new, I am made new</segment2>
		<segment3>Create in me a heart as pure as gold. The beauty of your love within my soul, Ohhh. You've never felt so near. And the view has never been so clear</segment3>
		<segment4>Here we are now in this moment. Here we are. You are my hope when I'm broken. I am at the end of myself. Here we are. this is the start of a new life. Like a child breathing this air for the first time. I am made new in you, in you, in you. I am made new in you, in you, in you</segment4>
		<segment5>Here we are now in this moment. Here we are. You are my hope when I'm broken. I am at the end of myself. this is the start of a new life. Like a child breathing this air for the first time. I am made new</segment5>
		<segment6>Here we are now in this moment. You are my hope when I'm broken. I am at the end of myself. Here we are. This is the start of a new life. I'm breathing this air for the first time. I am made new. I am made new. I am made new    </segment6>
