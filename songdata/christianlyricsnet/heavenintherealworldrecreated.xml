		<segment1>I saw it again today in the face of a little child. Looking through the eyes of fear and uncertainty. It echoed in a cry for freedom across the street and across the miles. Cries from the heart to find the missing part</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Where is the hope, where is the peace?. That will make this life complete. For every man, woman, boy, and girl. Looking for heaven in the real world</segment2>
		<segment3>To stand in the pouring rain and believe the sun will shine again. To know that the grave is not the end. To feel the embrace of grace and cross the line where real life begins. And know in your heart you've found the missing part</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. There is a hope, there is a peace. That will make this life complete. For every man, woman, boy, and girl. Looking for heaven in the real world. Heaven in the real world</segment4>
		<segment5>BRIDGE. It happened one night with a tiny baby's birth. God heard creation crying and He sent heaven to earth</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS. He is the hope, He is the peace. That will make this life complete. For every man, woman, boy and girl. Looking for heaven in the real world</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)    </segment7>
