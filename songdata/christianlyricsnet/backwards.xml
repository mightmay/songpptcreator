		<segment1>You can't go backwards, you must go forward. You have not been what you could be. When you are the only one that enslaves you. Then you're the only one that can set you free. Don't run away, question the answers. Live you life like it's on fire. You're one mistake is to think you've made one. Don't run away. You can't have mountains without the valleys. You can't go high if you won't go deep. You can't do over what you've done already. Expecting something new to see. I will not be bought, not be caged. Won't stay behind my walls where it is safe. No, I'm tired of trying to compensate for you. For you..     </segment1>
