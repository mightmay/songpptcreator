		<segment1>I'm as eloquent as an elephant. I'm as headstrong as the Mighty King Kong. On a rampage throwing airplanes. I can't believe You haven't gone away. Gone away</segment1>
		<segment2>I am difficult, argumentative. I'm as thick-skulled as the dinosaur bones on a display in a glass case. I can't believe You haven't run away. Run away</segment2>
		<segment3>It must be different through Your eyes. Because You look at me like it's the first time. That You've ever seen my face</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm preoccupied with a crowded mind. I get off track like a train rolling back to the future. Never too sure who'll be here when I come back around. But I'm finding out.     </segment4>
