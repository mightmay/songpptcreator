		<segment1>Most live a lifetime and never see. The soul of tomorrow in someone's eyes. Some give up on all of their dreams. One second before they materialize. But love broke through walls of stone. It was You, it was You alone</segment1>
		<segment2>You crack the sky like broken glass. You rescued me when my chance had passed. Sometimes things aren't as hard as you may think. Because all you need is just a touch of faith</segment2>
		<segment3>Some never ever turn a key to the door of their heart's desires. Too afraid to fall somewhere in between. Tomorrow's fears and the pressure's fire. Your love broke through walls of stone. It was You, it was You alone</segment3>
		<segment4>Your touch pushed back the clouds just like the sun. Your hand pulled me out of the hardest time. That I've ever known, that I ever knew. Oh Lord, that was all because I met You. Your love broke through walls of stone. It was You, it was You alone    </segment4>
