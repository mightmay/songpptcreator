		<segment1>You turned my way. You heard my cry. You turned my mourning into shouting. Sorrow may last for a night. But with the light I am seeing. I am singing</segment1>
		<segment2>You lifted me out. You lifted me out. And set me dancing, dancing. Free, now I am free. Your love rescued me. Now it's the anthem I'm singing</segment2>
		<segment3>Many will see. Many will hear. And find You strong enough to save. Many the wonders You have done. Your light has come, I am singing. I am singing</segment3>
		<segment4>Lost is where You found me. Shattered and frail. But You love me still. Trouble may surround me. My heart may fail. But You never will. You never will    </segment4>
