		<segment1>When I walk a thousand miles from home. And when I've lost all I used to know. It seems that I've got nothing left. I find that I'm undone. You are here to break me. And You've only just begun</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. With open arms You came running so far. To show who You are and who I am. Only You can change a heart. Like a shooting star You soar through the darkest of nights. To catch my eyes and guide me to the Father's arms</segment2>
		<segment3>When I wonder where You're leading me. With no direction, walkin' aimlessly. Still You're ever faithful. Still You're ever strong. Now I can call You Father. You're calling me back home</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Your arms, they're always wrapped around me. Your arms, they'll never cease to hold me. Hold me</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
