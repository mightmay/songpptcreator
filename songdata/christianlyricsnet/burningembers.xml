		<segment1>Were we ready, whos to say the answer?. Who is ever ready for these things?. No one could prepare us for the laughter. No one could prepare us for the pain</segment1>
		<segment2>You feel like burning embers. You feel like coming home. You feel like my forever. And thats all I need/want/have to know</segment2>
		<segment3>Every night I ask for your forgiveness. In grown up skin I still act like a child. I can make believe that I am flawless. Youre close enough to see the cracks I hide</segment3>
		<segment4>You have caused me tears of joy relentless. I cannot now imagine life without. I owe you more than humble words could confess. I love you more than I even know how</segment4>
		<segment5>You feel like burning embers. You feel like coming home. You feel like my forever. And thats all I need to know</segment5>
		<segment6>You feel like Christmas morning. You feel like summer rain. You feel like holy waters. That rinse away my stains</segment6>
		<segment7>You feel like children singing. You feel like midnight calm. You feel like breathing deeply. Until the storm is gone     </segment7>
