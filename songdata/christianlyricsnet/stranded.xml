		<segment1>You know it only breaks my heart. To see you standing in the dark alone. Waiting there for me to come back. I'm too afraid to show</segment1>
		<segment2>If it's coming over you. Like it's coming over me. I'm crashing like a tidal wave. That drags me out to the sea. And I wanna be with you. And you wanna be with me. I'm crashing like a tidal wave. And I don't wanna be. Stranded, stranded, stranded, stranded</segment2>
		<segment3>I can only take so much. These tears are turning me to rust. I know you're waiting there for me to come back. I'm to afraid to show</segment3>
		<segment4>I miss you, I need you. Without you, I'm stranded. I love you so come back. I'm not afraid to show    </segment4>
