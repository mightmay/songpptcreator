		<segment1>Let me tell you a story. Of a little boy who had lost his way. In search for something to make it a better day, But all he seemed to find. Was a world of hurt and pain. And a place that didn't seem to care that he'd lost his way. So the boy began to cry. Yes, the boy began to cry.</segment1>
		<segment2>Does anyone love?. Does anyone care?. Is anyone out there?. That finds me lovely. That fnds me lovely. That finds me lovely?</segment2>
		<segment3>Just when the little boy had lost all hope. Well, along came a man that usshered him in. He held him to his chest. and He said Little boy, it's time that you rest. He opened up His arms. And said, I've been searching for you for some time. now, little boy, you have found a home. And now longer shall you roam. Then the man began to cry. Yes, the man began to cry.</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't you know I love you?. Don't you know I care?. And I will always be here, And I find you lovely. Yes, I find you lovely. Yes I find you so so lovely. I find you lovely.. Yes, I find you lovely    </segment4>
