Can't believe what you see with your eyes. the disguise thats put on. when you look at her from far away. and she looks good when you're just driving by. then I cry when I notice up close she don't look the same. so just be careful about what you see. Don't believe anything until you get a second look. and jsut make sure that you always check out the bait. before you take the hook yeah.. Distance distortion factor its not a pretty sight Lets go. DDF it makes a great difference to me. you gotta make sure you know exactly what you see. DDF you can't just look passing by. You never know it might turn out to be a guy. DDF its just so hard to decide. Whats wrong from far away and wht is right. DDF it makes a great difference to me. You gotta know what you see now
