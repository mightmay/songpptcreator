		<segment1>. Hello Mercy, I have been searching for You lately. Ive been wounded and from what I hear. You have the remedy. They told me You would be for me so now I need to know. Is this a love that can save me. Or say You will then dont. Will You stay with me when nobody is around. If this is real, then tell me now</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Can You hold me together. Can Your love reach down this far. Can You hold me together. Cause without You holding my heart. Im falling apart</segment2>
		<segment3>Saying so long, been lost, been gone. Not sure what to pray. Its not easy but I know You see me. When I lose my way. I keep on floating not knowing if there is more for me. Dont want to sink beneath waves of negativity. Im going under, Im afraid that I might drown. If this is real, I need You now</segment3>
		<segment4>Im feeling stronger. With You by my side And. I realize You are my hope. I need to know. Without You, Im falling apart. Falling apart    </segment4>
