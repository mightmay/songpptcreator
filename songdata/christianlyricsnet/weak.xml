		<segment1>Light my path show me. The way filter everything. I say try to forgive try. To forget why do I do what. I regret? my flesh nature. Won't abide its ripping. Me apart inside Jesus. Pulls me back together. My soul will be with him. Forever can't get away. From bitterness can't. Seem to lose my. Selfishness my faith in father. God cause I am. Weak and he is strong!    </segment1>
