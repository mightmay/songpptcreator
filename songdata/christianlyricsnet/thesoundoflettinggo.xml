		<segment1>&quot;This is the sound of letting go. This is the last breath I'll ever know. This is the last breath I'll never know. As I look up with my last breath, and I say: I want to know what it's like. To walk in the footsteps you have made. I will run my course, finish my race. Until I'm called home. Death will bring the greatest day I've ever lived. On that glorious day held off so long, All the world will rejoice as the son comes home. I patiently await the day when all is revealed. When morning never comes. When we speak these words eyes to eye, Hand in hand, face to face.&quot;    </segment1>
