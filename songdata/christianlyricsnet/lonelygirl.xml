		<segment1>Winter breaks upon that lonely girl. A tell-tale stomach and a broken world and only grief. December finds her in a world of care. Nine months swollen. and abandoned there without relief from all this grief</segment1>
		<segment2>Her fear matched only by her appetite. Not knowing one day she would see the night. When all these troubles had been made all right. And that child would praise her</segment2>
		<segment3>Hide your tears now put your pain away. Let your fears belong to yesterday you're not alone</segment3>
		<segment4>December makes it's yule tide round again. A lonely girl lies lost in labor pain beyond relief. Water breaks inside that lonely girl. A child is brought into this broken world. So small so weak he knows no grief</segment4>
		<segment5>He only knows the one who brought him here. Gave him life and made his value clear. If he could speak his lips would know no fear. They would only praise her    </segment5>
