		<segment1>Hey. How ya doing again. You missed so much. Where have you been. Hey. I miss seeing your face. And hearing your voice. Just come back again. Please don't go away from me. It would break my heart to see you leave. And please don't go away from me. It would break my heart to see you leave. Hey. I lost my way. I miss seeing Your face. Where have I been. Hey. Do You still care. And do You still love me. Can I come back again. Hey. IÂ’m glad you could see. That life without me. Is just not the same.     </segment1>
