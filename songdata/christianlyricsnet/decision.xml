		<segment1>This song is for all between north and south, east and west, who are not quite sure which way to go. and tonight there is just one thing I want to know: what is your point of view?</segment1>
		<segment2>Do you belief in the hardcore way of life?. It's a decision of your mind. You might not have a second chance, come on decide it now.</segment2>
		<segment3>It's been a long time ago, since I got into touch with hardcore. I recognized that there is more than shows and proclamation. Responsibility, honesty, perseverance, wisdom are some values of this movement, did you know that?</segment3>
		<segment4>Please don't break my heart you better leave me alone.</segment4>
		<segment5>Though it's a big challenge to stay true in this world. wouldn't it be cool to see this movement grow?. Take a look at yourself, listen to the voice of your heart, make your decision and hope that you're on the right way.</segment5>
		<segment6>But realize this: You can't stop our way!    </segment6>
