		<segment1>Ill take care of you dont be sad dont be blue. Ill never break your heart in two Ill take care of you. Ill kiss your tears away Ill end your lonely days. All that Im really tryin to say is Ill take care of you</segment1>
		<segment2>I want you to know that I love you so. Im proud to tell the world youre mine. I said it before Ill say it once more. Youll be in my heart till the end of time</segment2>

		<segment4>I want you to know that I love you so. Im proud to tell the world youre mine. I said it before Ill say it once more. Youll be in my heart till the end of time</segment4>
		<segment5>Ill take care of you dont be sad dont be blue. Just count on me your whole life through. Cause Ill take care of you.     </segment5>
