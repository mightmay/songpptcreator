		<segment1>For the message. Of the cross is. Foolishness. To those who are perishing. But to us. Being saved. Its the power. Of God (I Corinthians 1:18)</segment1>
		<segment2>Theres no turning back. Unless were turning back to you</segment2>
		<segment3>Im not running away from this. Im not falling asleep. Im not taking a bribe from anyone for anything. Im not running away from this. Im not falling asleep. Im not turning back on the one thing that I know</segment3>
		<segment4>Were the foolish. Were the weak ones. Were the lowly. And despised things that are not. God will take us. He will shape us. He will make us. Nullify the things that are (I Corinthians 1:27-28)</segment4>
		<segment5>Theres no turning back. Unless were turning back to you</segment5>
		<segment6>Im not running away from this. Im not falling asleep. Im not taking a bribe from anyone for anything. Im not running away from this. Im not falling asleep. Im not turning back on the one thing that I know</segment6>
		<segment7>I have given up on breathing and all I need is You. I am never going down for air again    </segment7>
