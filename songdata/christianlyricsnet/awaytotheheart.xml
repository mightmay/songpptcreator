		<segment1>Welcome to this world today, You're seeing things a different way</segment1>
		<segment2>This blood is here to save your soul. It takes you down a better road. His eyes they see into our minds, And throw away the demons lies</segment2>
		<segment3>And angels' tears, they cry for you. Angels' tears, they always make things new.</segment3>
		<segment4>A way to the heart now, The way to go deep inside. A way to the heart now. There is something better there.    </segment4>
