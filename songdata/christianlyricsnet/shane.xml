		<segment1>So I told you all, Â‘Don't try it again.' You might think it's small. Until he rides it in. Like Shane, he comes when you need him. Then off to the dusty trails. You know it's a season, and he can't go home. Sometimes it don't make sense. It's best to leave it alone. It makes me feel real small that he controls the winds. Like Shane, he comes when you need him. Then off to the dusty trails. You know it's a season, and he can't go home. This ride seems long to me. It's not so far. Like Shane, he comes when you need him. Then off to the dusty trails. You know it's a season, and he can't go home.    </segment1>
