		<segment1>Bacon bits and jalapenos on my polish hot dog. half a pound of potato chips, and a beef jerky log. I press my face to the window, a wrapper sticks to my shirt. Eight people in a stinky van, a couple more couldn't hurt. Eat some food off the floor. I've developed a taste for bread mold. Ride aroudn in a van, don't take a shower for six weeks and..</segment1>
		<segment2>We've been given superpowers, ask us for an autograph. We sing, we dance we'll make you laugh, don't you want to be like us?. We've been given superpowers, ask about our rock and roll, our hair , our clothes, hobbies, and pets. Does he have a girlfriend yet? </segment2>
		<segment3>Everyone in the band can't stand me, just because I fell off the stage, and kind of by accident, I broke the promoters legs. Sometimes we have a deadline for writing our songs. Five minutes left to write this one la,la,la,la,la,la,la. Sleep in a sleeping bag. Every floor looks the same as last night. You wake up, you drive, you play a show, and then you sleep again. </segment3>
		<segment4>I sometimes feel like I'm holden caulfield, sometimes Jack Keroac. I wanted to be famous, now I want to take it back. Don't want to rock the mic, dont' want to meet the pope, I just want to share with you, how we got this peace and hope.</segment4>
		<segment5>I once wanted to be famous, now I want to take it back.    </segment5>
