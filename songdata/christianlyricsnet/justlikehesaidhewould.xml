		<segment1>Just like He said He would. He's coming back for me. In the twinkling of, In the twinkling of an eye. Just like He said He would. He's coming back for me. He's going to take me to my mansion. Take me to my mansion in the sky. When the trumpet sounds. He's coming back for me. In the twinkling of, in the twinkling of an eye. When the trumpet sounds. He's coming back for me. He's going to take me to my mansion. Take me to my mansion in the sky. He said if I go away, I'll come again someday. To receive you unto myself. But while I'm gone away. I'll be building you a place. And I'm coming back to take you there. To take you there, I'm gonna take you there. But when you hear the trumpet sound. That's when the dead in Christ, They're gonna rise. We shall see Him in all of His glory, in the twinkling of an eye. We gonna meet Him in the sky. Hallelujah, Glory Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Glory Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelu. Just like He said He would. He's coming back for me. In the twinkling of, In the twinkling of an eye. Just like He said He would. He's coming back for me. He's going to take me to my mansion. Take me to my mansion in the sky    </segment1>
