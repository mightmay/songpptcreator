		<segment1>Ive tasted fame but never fortune. And still I couldnt care less for both. I hope youre done saying &quot;I told you so&quot;. Cause I think Im done telling the world what I know. Everything is dark inside the whitest lie. When you take the truth in every half truth. You take the grey over the black and white</segment1>
		<segment2>I am everything and nothing</segment2>
		<segment3>Give me one good reason to believe Im not alone. I will wait for You to answer me. Ive never been much for smoke and mirrors so I need a hand to hold. I will wait for You to answer me</segment3>
		<segment4>Ive tasted blame poured out by brothers. And I much prefer a woman's scorn. They chastise me for being honest. When they hide behind their pride and their porn. Everything is white inside the blackest truth. I know you hate to hear it but its all that I can do</segment4>
		<segment5>I am everything and nothing. I am black and white, I am wrong and right     </segment5>
