		<segment1>I'm. Analog. Two-inch tape. Vintage, warm with a potent. Hiss. Venomous. Memories. Always ready to strike like this</segment1>
		<segment2>At your heels. Don't you feel. Like a trip. Back to 96?</segment2>
		<segment3>Insert cassettes. And then push eject. I'm flashing red. Can't let the past. Stay in it's cave. Cause rears it's head. Insert cassettes. And then push eject. You're flashing red. You don't expect. Me to rear my head. But I'm not dead</segment3>
		<segment4>Like. VCRs. I recall. I remember the magic. So. I can take. One last trip. Down the lane of your memory</segment4>
		<segment5>Till you twist. Like a viper. On my shins. And then you remind me..</segment5>
		<segment6>Once. Long ago. You. Were the hope. But. I forgot. Sweet. You're no tomorrow    </segment6>
