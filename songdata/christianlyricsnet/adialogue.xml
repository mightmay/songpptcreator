		<segment1>&quot;I have become so bitter that it has reached my core, But every day brings a battle that I can't win. Still it seems that I have all my drones in a row. I'll drown myself in holy water, and call myself at home. Can this be happening?. Let me know when to feel, and when to live my life again. I've tried my best to overcome. All that I truly have I will lay at your feet. I swear this better be worth it. It's been three hundred days of cold, and I am so alone. What can I make of this?. Oh me of little faith. Overtaken by mind and thought. I can't believe how far I've come, But it has taken so many steps to get here.&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;You speak your doubts in hope of finding. Something that I have not already seen. There are things that are so much greater. Than your heart could truly understand.&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;You've got me out on my hands and knees, But I'm a faithful son to no one. I bury loved ones in memories. Guide me as I walk over their ashes. I burn my bridges to the ground with failure as my road.&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>&quot;This is the real world, and you're falling apart.    </segment4>
