		<segment1>When I left home to be who I am. Some people said &quot;No Way&quot;. But I laid it all down, gave everything. In my head rang the words that my father said</segment1>
		<segment2>You're never far. I will be where you are. and when you come to me. I will open my arms</segment2>
		<segment3>Welcome Home, you. I know you by name. How do you do?. I shine because of you today. So come and sit down. Tell me how you are. I know son, it's good just to see your face.</segment3>
		<segment4>When I look at you holding my heart. I will give to you all that I have. Son I know there'll be times. You will feel all alone. I will share with you the words my father said</segment4>
		<segment5>You're never far. I will be where you are. and when you come to me. You can bet I will open my arms</segment5>
		<segment6>Welcome Home, you. I know you by name. How do you do?. I shine because of you today. So come and sit down. Tell me how you are. I know son, it's good just to see your face</segment6>
		<segment7>Said I've been waiting for that day. Just to feel your warm embrace. Your love has shown. I will never be alone. You will welcome me home</segment7>
		<segment8>I'll forever be. You will say to me. Welcome Home, you. I know you by name. How do you do?. I shine because of you today. So come and sit down. Tell me how you are. I know son, it's good just to see your face</segment8>
		<segment9>When I left home to be who I am. Some people said &quot;No Way&quot;     </segment9>
