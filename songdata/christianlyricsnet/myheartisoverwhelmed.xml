		<segment1>VERSE 1:</segment1>
		<segment2>Perfect in love. Lord, You came to earth. To rescue me. You took my place upon that cross. The stains that held me back. Were washed away. You made me whole</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS:</segment3>
		<segment4>Your love has set. The broken captives free. Your love released. The chains once binding me. I'm found in grace. In love's embrace. My heart is overwhelmed</segment4>
		<segment5>VERSE 2:</segment5>
		<segment6>I stand redeemed. Your Spirit now alive within my heart. I walk with you all of my days. I shall live to glorify You God. Hear my soul rejoice</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS:</segment7>
		<segment8>Your love has set. The broken captives free. Your love released the chains once binding me. I'm found in grace. In love's embrace. My heart is overwhelmed</segment8>
		<segment9>BRIDGE:</segment9>
		<segment10>Sings my soul of how. Your love has set me free. Sings my heart of how. Your mercy rescued me. Hear my cry of endless love. To my Saviour and to my King. My heart is overwhelmed. Sings my soul of how. Your love has set me free. Sings my heart of how. Your mercy rescued me. Hear my cry of endless love. To my Saviour and to my King. My heart is overwhelmed    </segment10>
