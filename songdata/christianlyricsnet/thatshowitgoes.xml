		<segment1>You are falling, falling fast away. Broken pieces lost along the way. Lost along the way. Do you really want to stay?</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, thats how it goes. Thats how it goes. To feel lost and all alone. Let it all go, let it all go. Dont put your trust in all you know</segment2>
		<segment3>There is hope for those who go astray. Those who seek the truth will find the way. But it feels the same. Do you really want to change?</segment3>
		<segment4>You gotta walk up to that line. All you need is faith this time. All thats broken will just fade away</segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
