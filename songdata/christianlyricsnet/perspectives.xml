		<segment2>Why can't you see that freedom is sometimes simply another perspective away. Who could you be if your lens was changed for a moment, Would you still be the same</segment2>
		<segment3>A young child looks through a great stained glass window. Watching the people go by. Everyone seems to be wearing a red coat. His mother sees jackets in white. Now he can't understand why does she see it this way</segment3>
		<segment4>Why can't you see that freedom is sometimes simply another perspective away. Who could you be if your lens was changed for a moment, Would you still be the same</segment4>

		<segment6>Why can't you see that freedom is sometimes simply another perspective away. Who could you be if your lens was changed for a moment, Would you still be the same    </segment6>
