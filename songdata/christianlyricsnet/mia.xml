		<segment1>Watch me heap up what I've sown. I'm made of peanuts, not of shells. God spares a quality of himself. Uniquely designed but we can't help ourselves. So &quot; Why, I made the face that bugs you. I won't design conversation around you. I made the face that bugs you. Spyglass scans the field</segment1>
		<segment2>Hold my hand, feel a chill in here. Tired of looking through you. I've found myself can you find you. So &quot; Why I've made the face that bugs you. I won't design. Spyglass scanned the field. Hold my hand, still feel a chill in here. Tired of looking through you. I've found myself can you find you. So &quot; Why, did I make the face. And I won't design. I made the face. I won't design    </segment2>
