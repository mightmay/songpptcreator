		<segment1>You thought you had it all figured out. You had a plan for everything you would face. What happens now when it just won't work out?. You can't run from what you've gotten into now. But don't lose hope, it's not all over now. It's not too late, there's still time to change. It's not the way it has to end up. You need someone to help pick you up. You're gripped by fear and you start to give up. Excuses made for all your mistakes. Procrastination will be your end, unless you crawl out of this hole you've dug.     </segment1>
