		<segment1>In the morning. I watch the sun rise. I feel the sunshine. Open my eyes. Look out a window. To see the blue skies. Feel the wind blow. Close my eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>I see You all around me. I see You everywhere. Your wonder, it surrounds me. You're beautiful, You're beautiful</segment2>
		<segment3>I see the imprint. I see the traces. Of Your beauty. On the faces. Of all the people. Passing by me. You're everywhere. I feel You moving    </segment3>
