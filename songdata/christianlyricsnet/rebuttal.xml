		<segment1>The innocence robbed at early stage. Bitterness allies for the cage. Pain gives birth to pain. And hope gets smudged with bloodstains. Despise yourself to swell with pride. and think your hatred will win the prize. I smell a change with horizons. A face in your path now gone. It's an attempt to deny. You'd better find an alibi. Spit in the face of mercy and now the debt you owe will multiply. Blame everyone but yourself while your so-called arguments tow the line. A twofold edge of hate spills emotion that blinds the public eye. No claims to the life of a victim. Offenses a list of lost freedoms. Keep mocking Keep mocking Keep mocking to fill infectious lies. A bead of sweat drips cold from your brow. and it's evident there's more to fear. Here's a response to that message of spite. that you've clung tightly to for all these years.. The season is ripe for payback. You don't want to face the fact that there's a debt to pay. Blame everyone but yourself. But be careful what you asked for. You've got your wish. With Judgment, with payback. Liar You've got a lot of nothing to say. You've got allot of hate to spray. You've got allot of nothing to say. Yet your life is the meaning of temporary.    </segment1>
