		<segment1>Yesterday. Once again. I fell down and broke a friend. Words were said. Out of place. and I hope that it's not too late. To right this wrong. Cause I was wrong</segment1>
		<segment2>I struck the match. and I burned the bridge. and I'm to blame for all of it. I lost your trust. When I drew my sword. This distance is my just reward. Can I undo the damage done</segment2>
		<segment3>damage done</segment3>
		<segment4>Couldn't sleep. Part of me. Was crying out from hurtin' you. So afraid. You would say. There is nothing I can do. To right this wrong. 'cause I was wrong</segment4>
		<segment5>I struck the match. and I burned the bridge. and I'm to blame for all of it. I lost your trust. When I drew my sword. This distance is my just reward. Can I undo the damage done</segment5>
		<segment6>damage done</segment6>
		<segment7>Listen friend. I must confess. You deserve more. and I gave you less. as It tears me up. That I let you down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry</segment7>
		<segment8>'cause I struck the match. and I burned the bridge. and I'm to blame for all of it. I lost your trust. When I drew my sword. This distance is my just reward. Can I undo the damage done</segment8>
		<segment9>damage done</segment9>
		<segment10>I'm sorry.     </segment10>
