		<segment1>A poor man on the corner. I could give to You by buying him lunch. But I rarely think about it. 'Cause I got a little but it's not that much. And I pray Lord won't You help me. Give me a little bit more for myself. And You say Child won't you let me. Take all that you got and give you a little real wealth</segment1>
		<segment2>And I don't know what You want. What You see in my life. And I don't know what You mean. How You could be glorified. I'm not too sure about this idea of sacrifice. What You mean by mercy, mercy in me. Your mercy in me</segment2>
		<segment3>A young girl in an old house. Three kids and another on the way. She's in desperate need of some new clothes. But I keep my old ones and tell her I'll pray for her. But Your heart breaks for those kids. And that child of a mom who's one of Your own. When a few gifts and a little time is another crown. I could lay at the feet of Your throne    </segment3>
