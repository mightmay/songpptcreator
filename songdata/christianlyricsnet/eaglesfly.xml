		<segment1>I will run and not be weak. Hope has come. Renewed my strength. I have found what I did seek. And I'm ready to fly</segment1>
		<segment2>All forgiven, all forgot. Heaven waits beyond the plot. Swing low, sweet chariot. Yes, I'm ready to fly</segment2>
		<segment3>Father come to save my soul. Father come to. Make me whole. There was a price. He paid the toll. Gave me freedom to fly</segment3>
		<segment4>And every battle, every war. You will be my shield and my sword. You know I'm waiting on You Lord. You give me freedom to fly</segment4>
		<segment5>Watch the eagles fly. Gonna set your feet on high. On the wind, like a dove. Go on and fly. In the shadow of love</segment5>
		<segment6>Fly, gonna fly</segment6>
		<segment7>Yes, I'm watching you fly. He set your feet on high. On the wind, like a dove. Go on and fly. In the shadow of love    </segment7>
