		<segment1>All these years to many ahead to think clear. some say where's my crystal ball. some men play the lottery makin bets against the governments economy. </segment1>
		<segment2>They say I'd rather be rich than be alive at all. When men in miry circumstances fall. it won't be hard to tell where they placed their resolve. Some trust in chariots. but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. To each his own won't lead you home and prob'ly never will. I won't trust in the things I do. they will not stand. they won't come through. </segment2>
		<segment3>So I'll trust in the name of the Lord my God..I'll trust in the name.. Picket fences may build our defense. In domestic wars of leisure suits. </segment3>
		<segment4>That's OK it doesn't bother me. you can hold onto your philosophy of. </segment4>
		<segment5>What's mine is mine, what's yours is yours, but whats the truth?</segment5>
		<segment6>When the walls do crumble and they fall. It won't be hard to tell where we place our resolve. when the walls do crumble and what will I find to hold on to. thats stronger than my Jesus? </segment6>
		<segment7>Sing hallelujah.. hallelujah.. When the walls do crumble and they fall. It won't be hard to see where we place our resolve.. </segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
