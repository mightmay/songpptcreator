		<segment1>I just saw the most amazing sunset. Well I watched as it sank into the sea. And bid another day goodbye by myself. I heard a bird sing the most beautiful song. But for the life of me, I can't remember that melody. I just remember that I had to dance alone. Oh and the days go by so fast. And the memories. They never seem to last. And I'm quick to see all I don't have. I need to change the way I look at. All I look at</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: And soak it up. Every little bit I can. Enjoy all my day. Before all my days end. And whatever I get. Always let that be enough. And never forget to soak it up. Yeah, yeah</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause I could get caught up in this crazy race. You know the world we live in leaves no room for second place. But I've got to believe there's more to life than winning. I ain't gonna miss out on. All the beauty in my life. Like my family and my friends and my wife. All the God given gifts that money can't buy. Oh cause the days go by so fast. And the memories they never seem to last. But I'm grateful for everything I have. Cause You've changed the way I look at. All I look at</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE: Ain't gonna be living tomorrows. And missing today. Ain't gonna be making treasures out of things that fade away. No I'd rather be living every second. Living every minute of every single day. Oh I will    </segment4>
