		<segment1>You give me rules that you tell me I must obey. But I don't want to follow what you have to say. I'm old enough to make deciesions for myself. And thats what I'm gonna do not you. And now I know I can't fight. The fact that you were wrong and I'm right. I have to change my life to make you happy. and I feel so incomplete. I feel dead Ifeel beat. I have to get out and be me to bring myself up again. You tell me no I tell you yes thats how its always been. Your rules are like aluminum they're so easy to bend. I'm old enough to make decisions for myself. and thats what I'm gonna do not you    </segment1>
