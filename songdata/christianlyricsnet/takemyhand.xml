		<segment1>Take my hand to the promise land. And on You I want to stand. Cause I cannot do it on my own. You're what I need and I need to be. Right by Your side cause I cannot hide. Lord, I know that I need You. Na na na na na na na na na, I need You. Na na na na na na na na na. Without You I'm so alone. I am weak but You are strong. You pick me up when I'm falling down. And I am crying. Out to You inside of my heart. I need You, Lord, oh so, for the part. I want You to have my life, Jesus. I fall to my knees. And I'm begging You, please, oh, Lord. Won't You change me. Make me new from the inside out. I want to shout out Your name    </segment1>
