		<segment3>(Verse 1). I was sitting here thinking of the possibilities, If my life was a song, Then what would be the melody, God could you sing it to me, Think I know some of the lyrics. Would you like to hear it, Although itÂ’s not finished, I have yet to live it, Could you help me through this.</segment3>
