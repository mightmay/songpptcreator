		<segment1>Sunshine, won't you be my mother. Sunshine, come and help me sing. My heart is darker than these oceans. My heart is frozen underneath</segment1>
		<segment2>We are crooked souls trying to stay up straight, Dry eyes in the pouring rain well. The shadow proves the sunshine. The shadow proves the sunshine</segment2>
		<segment3>To scared that I'll run always. Hold fast to the break of day light were. The shadow proves the sunshine</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh Lord, why did you forsake me?. Oh Lord, don't be far away away. Storm clouds gathering beside me. Please Lord, don't look the other way</segment4>
		<segment5>Crooked souls trying to stay up straight. Dry eyes in the pouring rain well. The shadow proves the sunshine. The shadow proves the sunshine</segment5>
		<segment6>To scared that I'll run always. Hold fast to the break of day light were. The shadow proves the sunshine. The shadow proves the sunshine</segment6>
		<segment7>Yeah Yeah, shine on me. Yeah Yeah, shine on me. Yeah Yeah, shine on me. Yeah Yeah, shine on me</segment7>
		<segment8>Crooked souls trying to stay up straight. Dry eyes in the pouring rain well. The shadow proves the sunshine. The shadow proves the sunshine</segment8>
