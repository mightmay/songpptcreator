		<segment1>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your nose. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir. And folks dressed up like Eskimos. Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe. Helps to make the season bright. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow. Will find it hard to sleep tonight. They say that Santas on his way. Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh. And every Mothers child is gonna spy. To see if reindeer really know how to fly. And so Im offering this simple phrase. To kids from 1 to 92. Although its been said. Many times, many ways. Merry Christmas to you</segment1>
