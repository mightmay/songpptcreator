		<segment1>I try to turn my back from the things that trap my mind. I try to save myself from those things coming from behind. I wave the banner of victory in my life, for I derive my strength from Jesus Christ. And you try to stop me with your hate. My own friends turn against me they can't relate. All of this world's substance I must reject. Turn my back, I must defect. Lies, the politically correct, I defect from the ties that bind, and all of the things that try to change my mind. from the truth and strength I have in Christ. Which I will hold for the rest of my life. Despite this worlds foolish lies, I defect. I defect. from the lie that teaches man to steal, from the lie that teaches man to kill, from the lie allowing children to die, from the lie that beats us and leaves us to die. I must defect.    </segment1>
