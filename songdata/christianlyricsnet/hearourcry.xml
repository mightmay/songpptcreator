		<segment1>What have I become?. What mercy have I shown without Your love?. 'Cause time and time again. A broken man, I stand, only on Your love</segment1>
		<segment2>Hear our cry with our hands lifted high. All strength and might comes from You. Only You. So gentle whisper come, fill these hollow lungs Fill them with Your life. Though time and time I fail with bruised and broken hands. IÂ’m reaching for Your love. I keep on reaching for Your love</segment2>
		<segment3>It comes from You, my God. Only from You, my God. All comes from You, my God. All from You, my God</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, so hear our cry with our hands lifted high All strength and might comes from You. (All power is Yours, God). Oh, hear our cry with our hands lifted high. All strength and might comes from You. Oh, It comes from You    </segment4>
