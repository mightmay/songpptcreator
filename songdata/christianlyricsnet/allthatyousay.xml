		<segment1>All that you say and reveal, all you command or conceal, all of your word here for me, all that you say is all that I need. Blest are the ones who will listen, blest are the ones who will hear. Speak, Lord while I am waiting, speak while my heart is near.</segment1>
		<segment2>All that is true, all that's right, all that is pure radiant light, all of your heart here for me, all that you say is all that I need. And blest are the ones who will listen. Blest are the ones who will hear. Speak, Lord, while I am waiting, speak while my heart is near.</segment2>
		<segment3>And thy word is a lamp to my feet and a light unto my path. And blest are the ones who will listen. Blest are the ones who will hear. Speak, Lord, while I am waiting, speak while my heart is near. Whoa, blest are the ones who will listen. Blest are the ones who will hear. Speak, Lord, while I am waiting, speak while my heart is near. Speak, Lord, while I am waiting. I'm waiting, waiting. Speak, Lord, while I am waiting. Speak, Lord, while I am waiting.    </segment3>
