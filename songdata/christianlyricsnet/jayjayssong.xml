		<segment1>I am myself and no. One else because my eyes. See so much negativity. Pressuring me every day. Thy judge me as. Something I'm not. There's so many lies in. This world today fears. And doubts run thru my. Mind I've gone thru this. A million times I read his. Word look to his face. But I could never earn. His grace it's not right to. Sit at home we're the. Church of today not. Church of tomorrow.     </segment1>
