		<segment1>You want to see me disappear, well it starts here. I'm trying my best not to say. what you don't want to hear. But it's alright, you can cover your (cover your) ears. I face my fears just once a year. It's the feeling I get. when I want to return everything that's in my life. I'll be busting at the seams.</segment1>
		<segment2>It's a gamble either way you play your cards. It's another tidal wave. But I'll be waiting with my eyes closed.</segment2>
		<segment3>No, I don't want to be the one who lives a lie, but never knew it was just a world away from. where I could feel like I've never felt before, so lock the door.</segment3>
		<segment4>You want to see my disappear, well it starts here. I'm trying my best just to say. what you don't want to hear. But it's alright, you can cover your (cover your) ears.</segment4>
		<segment5>It's a gamble either way you play your cards. It's another tidal wave. Bit I'll be waiting with my eyes closed.</segment5>
		<segment6>No, I don't want to be the one who lives a lie, but never knew it was just a world away from. where I could feel like I've never felt before, so lock the door.</segment6>
		<segment7>You're the one who told me to pack up all my. things and leave in the morning. It's just a world away form here, and I will never. bother you no more, and that's for sure.</segment7>
		<segment8>You'll never take me alive.    </segment8>
