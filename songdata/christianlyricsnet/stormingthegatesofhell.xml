		<segment1>Here we are. Storming the gates of Hell. (Our) whispers will silence your roars. And our roars will wreck your lives. So here we come, so here we come, So here we come, so here we come, So here we come, so here we come, So here we come.</segment1>
		<segment2>We were withered and drowned out. But raised up in Son soaked brilliance. Raised up!. This is our sound cutting through the noise. This is our sound cutting through the noise. Come forth, arise, overcome. Choir of disciples, choir of disciples, Choir of disciples, choir of disciples. </segment2>
		<segment3>Here we are. Storming the gates of Hell. (Our) whispers will silence your roars. And our roars will wreck your lives. So here we come, so here we come, So here we come, so here we come, So here we come, so here we come, So here we come. </segment3>
		<segment4>We were withered and drowned out. But raised up in Son soaked brilliance. Raised up! Come forth, arise, overcome. Return from exile, return from exile, Return from exile.    </segment4>
