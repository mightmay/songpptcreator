		<segment1>I trust in You, my faithful Lord. How perfect is Your love. You answer me before I call, My hope, my strength, my song. And I shout for joy, I thank You, Lord. Your plan stands firm forever. And Your praise will be continually pouring from my heart. I will bless You Lord. I will bless You Lord. How my soul cries out for You my God. I will bless You Lord     </segment1>
