		<segment1>Oh Lord You have shown Your favour, Your every word stands true, I'm found safe within in Your harbour, Anchored deep in You, You washed away my tears, Gave me joy and freedom, Lifting me through the years.</segment1>
		<segment2>Your love is stronger than, The sound of heaven's praises, Higher than, The lofty mountain peaks, Deeper than, The deepest ocean valleys. Strong enough for me.    </segment2>
