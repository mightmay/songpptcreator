		<segment1>I will drive a thousand miles. To escape the smog in this town. I will drive although I don't have a license. To escape the ideal that this city crowns</segment1>
		<segment2>Hide every little scar with so much make-up. The skin can't even breathe. Hide every little scar or become the food they feed</segment2>
		<segment3>Shift into a higher gear. Place the brick on the gas. On what I left behind I won't waste a tear. My rearview mirror has got broken glass</segment3>
		<segment4>I will drive until I reach the desert. And wait until I see with my own eyes again. I will drive I'll head for the desert. And wait until our minds speak the same words as back then</segment4>
		<segment5>This makes me into nothing in their eyes. But I'm willing to pay the price    </segment5>
