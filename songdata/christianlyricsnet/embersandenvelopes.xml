		<segment1>We write to apologize. We ask to look past life as it goes by. I know you have sacrificed time, life, love, time to fly. Please consider all things trite, forgiveness will be the thing that gets us by. I know to have something like this. broken is hard to fix.</segment1>
		<segment2>Embers, we're burning bridges down. Envelopes stuffed with feelings found. To write this down as means to reconcile.</segment2>
		<segment3>We write to patch things up, maybe not to agree but to proclaim love. Let's look ahead and then we'll see the one. whose glory never ends. And based on that we'll see, there'll be room for change, but gradually. I know to have something like this. broken is hard to fix.</segment3>
		<segment4>If all is said and done and over, if we don't have to, we're not going to. Make the change, it's worth the try. What's broken can be fixed tonight. </segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
