		<segment1>Walking out on another day. In control take me anyway. I want to find out. All alone at another door. Got a taste but I wanted more. I want to find out. I wouldn't lie now. I want to find out</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm older but I can't believe this soul. Waiting like a child. I'm calling can you tell me how to go. Waiting to be told</segment2>
		<segment3>Want a taste of another land. Give my life fore a second chance. I want to find out. Give myself to another king. What does your independence bring. I want to find out. I wouldn't lie now. I want to find out</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm older but I can't believe this soul. Waiting like a child. I'm calling can you tell me how to go. Waiting to be told. Jesus are you waiting for me. Time to make my move</segment4>
		<segment5>Calling out. I'm older now. I'm calling out     </segment5>
