		<segment1>This is the last chance you got, open wide. We both know we're both going to die, but there's a difference with you and I. You want Peace but refuse the fight. So shake hands with change tonight. Bathe in armor, for death feeds. O' death, don't bother me tonight. Be grace, my God, and stand still. Be grace, my God, and send more minutes. For churches have nuns, cowboys got guns and everyone's waiting to die</segment1>
