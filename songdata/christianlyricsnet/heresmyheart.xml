		<segment1>Dear Lord, are You there. Listening to my little prayer. I don't know exactly what to say. I've been told that You love me. Hear when I call. Would help me when I fall. I should let You have Your way. What I guess I'm trying to say. That I need You in my life. Cause I know I'm tired of living in the past. I'd like in to take a chance. On a change inside. I believe that Yours is one. That's going to last so</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Here's my heart, it's been broken. It's been wounded. But I'll give it all to You. If You would love me. Here's my life, if You want it. You can have it. I will give it all to You. Because You love me</segment2>
		<segment3>Dear Child, I'm right here. Through your worries. Through your fears. I've been waiting for you. To call My name. Oh you know, that I hear you. If you turn to Me and trust. My word is true. You will never be the same. I'm standing here to say. You need Me in your life. Cause I know that you can't make it. On your own. Oh if you would take that chance. Let Me change you deep inside. I promise you will never be alone, so</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>You can turn to me and know. That I am always standing by. I gave it all for you so you could have this. Gentle peace inside. I will follow you cause I believe in. Everything you are. I am your father, You are my Savior. And in the matters of the heart. I am taking yours and you are taking mine    </segment5>
