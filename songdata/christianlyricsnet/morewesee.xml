		<segment1>Our hearts are breathing in the wonders of Your name. And we're breathing out Your praise. The more we see, we sing. The circle never ends. For Your glory never fades. And surely as the rising sun. Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever</segment1>
		<segment2>From the heights of Your throne. To the depths of Your heart. Your majesty surrounds us. In the power of Your life. In the grace of Your cross. Your mercy has found us</segment2>
		<segment3>Your power we see displayed. In all that You have made. In the sky and sea and stars. And here beneath Your cross. Your mercy speaks so loud. Speaking straight into our hearts. And surely as the rising sun. Your love O Lord endures, Your love endures forever</segment3>
		<segment4>And the more we see, we sing. &quot;Holy is the name of the Lord&quot;. And the more we see, we sing. &quot;There is no one like You, God&quot;</segment4>
		<segment5>Your majesty surrounds us. Your mercy, Lord, has found us. There is no one like You, God     </segment5>
