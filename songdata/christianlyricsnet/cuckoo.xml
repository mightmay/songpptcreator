		<segment1>Your Pride and Joy is a Pretty Beast. The baddest apples fall from rotten trees. The little monster is a walking disease. You got only yourself to blame . Cause all else failed!</segment1>
		<segment2>And youre. HOT HOT. On my trail and you know that its. NOT NOT. Not my fault but you know that you. GOTTA GOTTA. Pin the Tail when all else fails. Cuckoo, cuckoo!</segment2>
		<segment3>Biting the hand that over-feeds. Lord of the Flies aint no mystery. Mean as Murder or Precious and Sweet?. You got only yourself to blame . Cause all else failed!</segment3>
		<segment4>Momma hide the children. Someone get the baby!. Momma turn all the lights on. Somebody pull the shades!    </segment4>
