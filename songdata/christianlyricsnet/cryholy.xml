		<segment1>every sun and moon and star. all declaring who you are. we fall silent in amazement. every word who and deep of man. every sea and grain of sand. all creation speaks. and now we sing to proclaim your majesty. let the earth rejoice. singing with one voice. let the people cry. holy holy lord. every creature sing. praises to the King. all creation cry. holy is the Lord. every song sung on the earth. will never capture all your worth. we fail silent in amazement. let every humble heart now see. the beauty of your majesty. all creation speaks. and now we sing to the king above all kings..    </segment1>
