		<segment1>Oh I got something that you all could get. In life it's been given. Called the Prizm shows its colors. And on the 17th day of the 2nd month. Come a come people let the flood gates open. Come oh people open Precipitation formed. Colors of freedom a gift of Prizm. Red orange yellow blue green and indigo. Is the flag or freedom. Remind me of the sin to go. Away away the promise remains. The same yesterday as it is today. Fall of man and fall of rain came. Down from the heavens to cleanse you and I. month. Come a come people let the flood gates open. Come oh people open Precipitation formed. Colors of freedom the gift or Prizm. The rains came down. The floods went up. Open the flood gates and let the people in. Open the flood gates let 'em in Precipitation formed. Colors of freedom the gift of prizm    </segment1>
