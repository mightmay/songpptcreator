		<segment1>When the beat starts pumping. That's it --- Yeah. The hitman's on the mic getting lyrically sick. My boys with the tools to groove. To make you want to move. The P.O.D is rock'n. And we have nothing to prove. So with the mic in my hand. Let me state this now. You can get with this. Ain't no way no how. Forget your fingers homeboy. You'll do the walking. No need for words. We let the music do the talking. God made me. And I'm funky. We're set free. Close your eyes and let your heart see. God made me. It's the P.O.D. and we're funky. We're set free. For all eternity</segment1>
		<segment2>Now it's obvious to see that we're dope. We're dope. Confusing the mind with this flow you can't cope. Cope. What you gonna do when you're faced by my crew. With the game that is true there's no hope. Hope</segment2>
		<segment3>Why do you try to front, You know that my God is so hard. Taking out you chumps. Is just a walk in the park. Keep your lips shut. With all your hawking and squawking. No need for words. We let the music do the talking</segment3>
		<segment4>God made me. And I'm funky. We're set free. Close your eyes and let your heart see. God made me. It's the P.O.D. and we're funky. We're set free. For all eternity</segment4>
		<segment5>God made me. And I'm funky. We're set free. Close your eyes and let your heart see. God made me. It's the P.O.D. and we're funky. We're set free. For all eternity    </segment5>
