		<segment1>Don't you ever forget that he has given us a future and a hope.</segment1>
		<segment2>Said it's sad, said it was a shame. Bet you thought I caught a boat to bombay. On the line just to let you know. I will be around</segment2>
		<segment3>Underneath the bridge to nowhere. Like I'm livin' out a game of solitaire. Goin' up to a better day. I will be around</segment3>
		<segment4>Hey world, it's me. I still have the heart, still have the dream</segment4>
		<segment5>Come on, people. We've got to come together. It's you and me. Hope will make us stronger. Freedom it rings. Do you hear it calling. Reach out and touch. And love will take us higher</segment5>
		<segment6>Somebody threw a brick at my vision. Tried to sabotage my mission. Either way, I believe. I will be around</segment6>
		<segment7>I wanna know, people are you with me. Open up your heart and just believe. Take a step, let me hear you say. I will be around</segment7>
		<segment8>Hey world, it's me. I still have the heart, still have the dream</segment8>
		<segment9>For he knows the plans he has for you. A plan to prosper and not to harm you. To give you a future, and a hope    </segment9>
