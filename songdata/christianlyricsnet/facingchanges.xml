		<segment1>It happened with out warning, it came so fast. Unanswered questions hanging, over my head. Facing changes, on my own, never helping, I'm falling back in the hole. Facing changes, not my own, unexpecting, I think I'm losing control. Time only can do so much, times not enough. I'm searching and not finding, whats to become. Facing changes, on my own, never helping, I'm falling back in the hole. Facing changes, not my own, unexpecting, I think I'm losing control. Its not so easy, to put the past behind me. You cant just live and forget, all that you ever have known. Things seemed so certain, and now I'm learning, our hope cant be placed in these things that don't come from above. Facing changes, on my own, never helping, I'm falling back in the hole. Facing changes, not my own, unexpecting, I think I'm losing control. It happened with out warning, it came so fast. Unanswered questions hanging, over my head.    </segment1>
