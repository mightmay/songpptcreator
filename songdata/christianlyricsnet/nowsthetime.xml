		<segment1>All day long. I've sat here for. I cannot find my way. Left or right, I'll still go on. But will I see your face. But now is the time. We will survive. To see the light of another day. But now is the time. We will survive. To see the light of another. Days go by. What can I do?. What did I do for you?. And in the end. What will there be. And how much left of me. [Chorus x3].     </segment1>
