		<segment1>My fall draws near. . My life fell out of my hands and into. This hole where everything's cold. I lose the feeling of guilt. There's. nothing inside, my innocence died. And now the emptiness grows, it's. bringing me down and taking my crown. I've seen where everything's dark. It's here in my soul, I'm losing control. . CHORUS: Have mercy on me. Have mercy on me. Have mercy on me for every thorn I've driven in. . Within these walls you'll see. Alone in here - the end. . Before my very last day I'm making it stop. I'm turning it off. I'll fight the feeling I have until everything's. Gone. Resistance has won. Now time is healing these wounds and. You are still here releasing my fear. My life fell out of my hands. They. took it away, I'm taking it back. . (CHORUS). . And everyday I feel like this weight's. Constantly dragging me down. Broken for the last time (Never get the best of me, won't get the best of me). I've got a heart of steel, but your words are. Constantly bringing me down. I'm open for the first time (Never get the best of me, wont' get the best of me). . (CHORUS). . My fall drawns near.    </segment1>
