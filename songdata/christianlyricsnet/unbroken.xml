		<segment1>To be unbroken. To be unbroken</segment1>
		<segment2>Fallen to pieces. (I am undone). The things you said. (Manipulation). I trusted you like a fool. While you made all the rules. So you searched me out. And you took me down</segment2>
		<segment3>To be unbroken, what would that be?. If words that were spoken, had not shattered me. If I was unbroken, I'd never know. The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go. To be unbroken. To be unbroken</segment3>
		<segment4>The things you found. (To use against me). Have lost their sound. (When mercy ensoothed me). I fell to the Father's feet. His words washed all over me. And all the scars you made. Watch them fade away</segment4>
		<segment5>To be unbroken, what would that be?. If words that were spoken, had not shattered me. If I was unbroken, I'd never know. The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go. To be unbroken. To be unbroken</segment5>
		<segment6>I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet. Embraced the victory, and some defeat. I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet. I found the beauty in the place they meet</segment6>
		<segment7>To be unbroken, what would that be?. If words that were spoken, had not shattered me. If I was unbroken, I'd never know. The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go. To be unbroken. To be unbroken</segment7>
		<segment8>To be unbroken, what would that be?. If words that were spoken, had not shattered me. If I was unbroken, I'd never know. The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go. To be unbroken. To be unbroken</segment8>
		<segment9>To be unbroken. To be unbroken    </segment9>
