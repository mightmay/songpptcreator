		<segment1>Nothing in heaven or on earth. Ever will keep me from Your love. Love that is more than all I need. Love that is everything to me</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I will give away this love. Just as it gave itself for me. Rivers of living water flow. So that the world might come to know</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. The love of God is great. The love of God is good. The love of God runs deep. The love of God. The love of God is true. The love of God is sweet. The love of God runs deep. The love of God</segment3>
		<segment4>There is a love that conquers all. It is the power to set us free. Free of the cares this world pursues. Free to be given unto You</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Loving You is amazing. Loving You is amazing.     </segment5>
