		<segment1>Little child dry your crying eyes. How can I explain the fear you feel inside. Cause you were born into this evil world. Where man is killing man and no one knows just why. What have we become just look what we have done. All that we destroyed you must build again </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: When the children cry let them know we tried. Cause when the children sing then the new world begins </segment2>
		<segment3>Little child you must show the way. To a better day for all the young. Cause you were born for all the world to see. That we all can live with love and peace. No more presidents and all the wars will end. One united world under God </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>What have we become just look what we have done. All that we destroyed you must build again. No more presidents and all the wars will end. One united world under God </segment5>
		<segment6>When the children cry let them know we tried. When the children fight let them know it ain't right. When the children pray let them know the way. Cause when the children sing then the new world begins    </segment6>
