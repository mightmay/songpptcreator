		<segment1>I ain't talkin' about cartoons Saturday morning TV. Remote control, it's time to set your mind free. Kick up your feet, flippin' the channels. Brotherly love, I'm leadin' by example. You're up all night watchin' late night cinema. Trying' to get your life straight like that Y2K millennium. Cops shows, talk shows, infomercials with a deal. Give 'em up 'cause it's time for somethin' real</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>You know it's time for somethin' true. Talkin' about somethin' real. The rest is up to me and you.  . Verse two goes somethin' like this, in a quick smack hurry. Open your eyes 'cause your vision's kinda blurry. Cash rules everything around me, cream is the money let me tell ya. That's a bunch of bologna. 'Cause everything I need the Lord has given me. and everything I have is everything I need. So take time realize how you should feel. and give it up 'cause it's time for somethin' real</segment3>
		<segment4>Well He's the real deal, He's the reason every season and so you should kneel. and give thanks and then be praisin' Him in every way. And then you'll see that He has loved you from the very day, so listen to what we have to say. about a story that's as real as it gets so take heed. Pay attention 'cause for you and I it's Elohim we need. Our little journey isn't all about this record deal. We're here to tell you that it's time for somethin' real.    </segment4>
