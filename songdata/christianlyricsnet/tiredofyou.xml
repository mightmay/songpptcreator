		<segment1>There's no better way to tell you how I feel than this. Don't act so surprised, it's been like this a long time. Every time you turn your back on me, it breaks my heart to think of all those times that I was there for you. If there ever comes a time when I won't be there. I hope you have some time and find someone else to abuse. I won't be there, I'm not a fool. I am getting tired of you. I remember those rainy days when I stayed in. I'd call you on the phone and try to be your friend. But to no avail, I swore it would never happen again. Two phone calls later and I gave it. I'm such a sucker, why do I try so hard?. The simple things I do to prove I care for you. I won't be there, I'm not a fool. I am getting tired of you. I won't let this world get me down. And your silly games won't get me down. I pray to god that you won't get me down.    </segment1>
