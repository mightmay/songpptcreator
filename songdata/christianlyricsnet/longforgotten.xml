		<segment1>Feeling low, like Im ready crack and slowly moving from bending to breaking. I stay diluted to avoid the pain, but I give her more than she can take. Im only killing the only haven, the still asylum I havent destroyed yet. And when its gone, Im left with nothing.</segment1>
		<segment2>This isnt what we counted on. This isnt what we said itd be. The fantasy is dead, and I cannot feel it. This isnt what we counted on. This isnt what we said itd be. The fantasy is dead, and long forgotten.</segment2>
		<segment3>I told her she was killing me and she said she was already dead. Every ounce of emotion fades, and I promise you itll end someday. I hope. Im only hoping that this is common. Shes all Im left with when all this fades away. And when its gone Im left with nothing.</segment3>
		<segment4>This isnt what we counted on. This isnt what we said itd be. The fantasy is dead, and I cannot feel it. This isnt what we counted on. This isnt what we said itd be. The fantasy is dead, and long forgotten.</segment4>
		<segment5>She doesnt need it. She doesnt need it. My optimism is masking my failure.</segment5>
		<segment6>This isnt what we counted on. This isnt what we said itd be. The fantasy is dead, and I cannot feel it. This isnt what we counted on. This isnt what we said itd be. The fantasy is dead, and long forgotten.    </segment6>
