		<segment1>YOUR WORD, I CAN'T DENY YOUR TRUTH. IT COVERS ME AND LIGHTS THE WAY AHEAD. YOUR WAYS OF MERCY NEVER END. MY LIFE SURROUNDED BY THE HOPE WITHIN. YOU'VE PLACED A FIRE WITHIN MY HEART, AWAKENING DESIRE FOR YOU. FOREVER LORD WILL YOUR WORD REMAIN. WE SING GLORY TO YOUR NAME, GLORY TO YOUR NAME. FOREVER KING OF ETERNAL FAME. SO WE SING GLORY TO YOUR NAME, GLORY TO YOU NAME. I STAND UPON THE THINGS YOU SAID. MY TRUST IN YOU AND BY YOUR WORD I LIVE. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE RESCUED ME. MY WAY IS SET, YOUR LIGHT WILL LEAD ME ON. FOLLOW, FOLLOW, FOLLOW, FOLLOW YOU.    </segment1>
