		<segment1>I feel You falling. Like the rain against my skin. I hear You calling. Your voice like thunder in my head</segment1>
		<segment2>But now I am stalling. 'Cause I'm afraid to let You in. Come break me down with Your mercy. Come break me down again</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm Yours tonight. I'm Yours if You can break me down. Break through these walls I hide behind. I'm Yours tonight. Come and break me down. Won't You break me</segment3>
		<segment4>I feel it inside me. I feel You underneath my skin. These walls could not hide me. They could not keep you from coming in</segment4>
		<segment5>So now here You find me. Right back to where I began. Come break me down with Your mercy. Come break me down again</segment5>
		<segment6>I need Your strength to feel this weak. And I need Your touch to feel my need. And I need Your strong hands to carry me. Take me break me set me free</segment6>
		<segment7>I need Your strength to feel this weak. And I need Your touch to feel my need. And I need Your strong hands to carry me. Take me bring me to my knees</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm Yours tonight. I'm Yours if you can break me down. Break through these walls I hide behind. I'm Yours tonight. Come and break me down. Come and break me down. Come and break me down. Won't You break me down</segment8>
