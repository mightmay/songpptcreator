		<segment1>The timeless theme, Earth and Heaven will pass away. Its not a dream, God will make all things new that day. Gone is the curse from which I stumbled and fell. Evil is banished to eternal hell.</segment1>
		<segment2>No more night. No more pain. No more tears. Never crying again. And praises to the great &quot;I AM.&quot;. We will live in the light of the risen Lamb.</segment2>
		<segment3>See all around, now the nations bow down to sing. The only sound is the praises to Christ, our King. Slowly the names from the book are read. I know the King, so theres no need to dread.</segment3>
		<segment4>No more night. No more pain. No more tears. Never crying again. And praises to the great &quot;I AM.&quot;. We will live in the light of the risen Lamb.</segment4>
		<segment5>See over there, theres a mansion, oh, thats prepared just for me, Where I will live with my savior eternally.</segment5>
		<segment6>No more night. No more pain. No more tears. Never crying again. And praises to the great &quot;I AM.&quot;. We will live in the light of the risen Lamb.</segment6>
		<segment7>All praises to the great &quot;I AM.&quot;. Were gonna live in the light of the risen Lamb.     </segment7>
