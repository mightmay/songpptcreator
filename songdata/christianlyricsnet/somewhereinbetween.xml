		<segment1>I can't meet. Losing sleep over this. No I can't. And now I cannot stop pacing. Give me a few hours. I'll have this all sorted out. If my mind would just stop racing </segment1>
		<segment2>Cause I cannot stand still. I can be this unsturdy. This cannot be happening </segment2>
		<segment3>This is over my head. But underneath my feet. Cause by tomoroow morning I'll have this thing beat. And everything will be back to the way that it was. I wish that it was just that easy </segment3>
		<segment4>Cause I'm waiting for tonight. Been waiting for tomoroow. I'm somewhere in between. What is real. Just a dream. What is real. Just a dream. What is real. Just a dream </segment4>
		<segment5>Would you catch me if I fall out of what I fell in. Dont be surprised if I collapse down at your feet again. I don't want to run away from this. I know that I just don't need this </segment5>
		<segment6>Cause I cannot stand still. I can be this unsturdy. This cannot be happening </segment6>
		<segment7>Cause I'm waiting for tonight. Been waiting for tomorrow. And I'm somewhere in between. What is real. Just a dream. What is real. Just a dream. What is real. Just a dream. What is real just a dream     </segment7>
