		<segment1>Verse #1: I can almost tell you each time I'm gonna fall. Devil always paint the same picture, sweet frame and all. I wanna change. And you would think by now I'd catch the scenario. Sorta like a old sitcom playing the same show. I wanna change. I'm sick of my own ways. End up in the same place. Gotta set my affection. For my own protection. I can't go on the same way Lord so</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I lift my hands to you. You're my only help</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse #2: I'm sick of living life so predictable, yes I know. I'm saved but sometimes I get really comfortable, Oh Lord. I wanna change. I'm sick of all the ups and downs I want consistency. Tired of all the shaky ground give me stability, Oh Lord. I wanna change. I cast out all pronography uproot that thing up out of me. Devil you no longer have any control over me. While I bare adultery. Looking at my sister lustfully. In Jesus' name you gotta leave, Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
