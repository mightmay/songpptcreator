		<segment1>When hardship comes to prey on hopes. And troubles seem to linger on. When death rolls on taking ones we love. You are the hope that keeps us on</segment1>
		<segment2>Alleluia, Thine the glory. Alleluia, Amen. Alleluia, Thine the glory. Revive us again</segment2>
		<segment3>When all this seems the battles lost. And such disease is spreading on. When life grows dark and our lips are parched. You are the hope that we sing of </segment3>
		<segment4>Alleluia, Thine the glory. Alleluia, Amen. Alleluia, Thine the glory. Revive us again</segment4>
		<segment5>When death is past and sins are gone. Alas forgiveness here is won. All daughters and sons we will stand as one. We're safe at last in the Father's love. We're safe at last in the Father's love</segment5>
		<segment6>Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia</segment6>
		<segment7>Alleluia, Thine the glory. Alleluia, Amen. Alleluia, Thine the glory. Revive us again. Again!    </segment7>
