		<segment1>Tears that fell like rain. Streamed down from my heart. Colors turned to gray. Emptiness led the way. Until I fell apart</segment1>
		<segment2>You came to save. To show me that</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: You're just a prayer away. No matter where I am. I know in my heart. You're never too far. When I'm losing my way. You're just a prayer away. My strength is in my faith. I'm never alone. I'm never afraid. Cause you're just a prayer away</segment3>
		<segment4>When I close my eyes. Lord, I call your name. And the dark subsides. Nothing can take the place. Of the peace I find</segment4>
		<segment5>You came to save me. To show me that</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge: Whenever I ened to fine you. I just fall on my knees. In you I find the strength that I need. To live , to believe</segment7>
		<segment8>Repeat chorus    </segment8>
