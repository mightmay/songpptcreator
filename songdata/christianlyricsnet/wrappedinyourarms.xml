		<segment1>Is this the whole picture. Or is it just the start?. Is this the way you love me?. You're capturing my heart. I used to try and walk alone. But I've begun to grow. And when you tell me just to rest. I'm finally letting go. I let go</segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm here to stay. Nothing can separate us. And I know, I'm ok. You cradle me gently. Wrapped in your arms.. I'm home</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm seeing so much clearer. Looking through your eyes. I could never find a safer place. Even if I tried. All the times I've needed you. You've never left my side. I'm clinging to your every word. Don't ever let me go. Don't let go    </segment3>
