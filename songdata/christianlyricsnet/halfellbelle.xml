		<segment1>at the big blue summer noon. from this tiny space. window parts the open heart. with quickened pace. how can this be?. nothing can assure. a section this small of the I endures</segment1>
		<segment2>half ell belle with plastic legs that are too long. dress her up to sing a different song. yesterday this, that the day before. this wont last a second more</segment2>
		<segment3>diving in the wishing well. look for what I lack. but every tarnished coin. I threw right back</segment3>
		<segment4>for my own I'd do anything. for my own I'd go anywhere    </segment4>
