		<segment1>We knew you'd hate this before we wrote it. So listen up, we're telling you before you tell us. We're not misinformed or misdirected, Functioning on your subjective. Your hatred only fuels us on. Now how about a word or two on you?. You're an alias, an email address. We lay alot more out than you do. We won't be part of your revolution. So listen up, we're telling you this is a business. We're not misinformed or misdirected. We'll make our own insurrection. So keep on publishing our wrongs. Now how about a word or two on you?. You're a paper fist, a faceless attack. We're not about to break like you do    </segment1>
