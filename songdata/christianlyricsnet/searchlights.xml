		<segment1>It's like the breath before they're time. It's like the truth after a lie. This light is taking over. Searchlights in every corner</segment1>
		<segment2>It's like a lock it. Escaping in the Dawn. I swear we'll flood your city. No choice of what your getting</segment2>
		<segment3>If you want your people. Let me know. If you want it and to see it. Let me know. Wash away the tears for you. Just let me know. Meet the Sea and then you'll want. Let me know</segment3>
		<segment4>The secret is in the wind. The rumors now begin. You want to hear the silence. You want the quiet silence</segment4>
		<segment5>The flood is about to break. The clock will not take. I swear we'll flood your city. No choice of what your getting</segment5>
		<segment6>No one, no one, can breathe. No one, can see. They are, they are, asleep, asleep. They will, be seen</segment6>
		<segment7>Break away the voice is calling. Break the door the sleep are calling. Not to late to open up your heart</segment7>
		<segment8>Keep Him here. He will hear the shatter of the lies. (?). Not to late to find out who you are</segment8>
		<segment9>*&lt;em&gt;These lyrics may be incorrect and will be updated when the album is released&lt;/em&gt;*    </segment9>
