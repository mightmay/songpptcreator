		<segment1>Hey, don't write your song 'bout spit. It's only in you head to fill your mouth -- well, look out, Mom. The Bible says Christ healed a sightless man. With only dirt and spit He twirled Himself -- He cured this way</segment1>
		<segment2>He just takes some grime, lets it swirl in the spittle. Rubs his eyes with it and then the man could see just fine. 'Cause he left everything to Jesus Christ in John 9</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey, you know this song is strange. I know you're droolin' at the thought of more (thought of more) -- I know I am. So get a Bible out and just brace yourself. Because in chapter eight in the book of Mark (book of Mark). There's somewhere else</segment3>
		<segment4>He just takes some blind little-known individual. Rubs his eyes with His spit, then He says, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;. Then the man said it looked like trees -- oh my! Hold tight!. It just takes two times -- didn't have to double-dribble. Touched the guy just once again and he could see just fine. Yes and the medicine was real saliva, no lie</segment4>
		<segment5>Hey, don't write this song off yet. There's one more incident that we left (we left out) so look that up. This dude was deaf (both mute and deaf). Christ put his fingers in (He put his fingers in). And don't worry 'bout the the spitting part (spitting part) I'm gonna say</segment5>
		<segment6>He just takes saliva -- yeah, the Lord spit a little. Then applied it to the deaf man's tongue and Jesus sighed. And said &quot;Ephphatha&quot; and his ears were quite alright. So just take some time in the Word, read a little. Of the Bible -- Mark chapter seven's where you'll meet the guy. Then read the rest of it you'll see the light    </segment6>
