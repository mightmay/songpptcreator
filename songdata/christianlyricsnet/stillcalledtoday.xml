		<segment1>There's a hole the size of a cruel word. In a wouned heart somewhere that's learning to hide the pain. There's a thorn stuck in the conscience of. Someone who spoke a word in anger. And they can't wash away the stain sorry's such a hard word to say</segment1>
		<segment2>But while it's still called today won't somebody make it right. Before the day slips into night and the moments waste away. While it is still called today we've got to say the words. That are longing to be heard 'cause tommorrow may be too late. Go on and say what you need to say while it is still called today</segment2>
		<segment3>There's a girl who's waiting day after day. To hear her father say I love you as the days turn into years. There's a wall that silence has turned to stone. Between a man and a woman she's holding back the tears. And he's holding on to his fears </segment3>
		<segment4>But while it's still called today won't somebody make it right. Before the day slips into night and the moments waste away. While it is still called today we've got to say the words. That are longing to be heard 'cause tommorrow may be too late. Go on and say what you need to say today</segment4>
		<segment5>There is a time when the sun goes down. And the flowers are laid on the grave. Will the tears that fall to the ground. Be the tears of regret for the words someone didn't say</segment5>
		<segment6>But while it's still called today won't somebody make it right. Before the day slips into night and the moments waste away. While it is still called today we've got to say the words. That are longing to be heard 'cause tommorrow may be too late. Go on and say what you need to say while it is still called today </segment6>
