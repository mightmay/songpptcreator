		<segment1>How peaceful it feels against my face. Oh, what a long haul. You brought me here for this. I see nothing but disaster. Now I'm taking you with me</segment1>
		<segment2>A transparent scenery that comes as fast as it leaves</segment2>
		<segment3>Now my eyes flash with white. It's settling in with all the flickering</segment3>
		<segment4>Here again</segment4>
		<segment5>The floor is more fitting for my face</segment5>
		<segment6>Here again? This is getting old</segment6>
		<segment7>I am being watched. This is overwhelming. Paranoia</segment7>
		<segment8>As you dig your feet in I will sink my teeth in the floor, While I lay here alone</segment8>
		<segment9>As the light begins to breach the border, While I lay here alone</segment9>
		<segment10>Aware of every step. I'm not aware at all. Black flash white  I am awake.     </segment10>
