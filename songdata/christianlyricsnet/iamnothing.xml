		<segment1>I am nothing without You. Only a fly upon the wall. Listening in, hoping to find something about You. That will keep me from this fall</segment1>
		<segment2>And sometimes I catch a glimpse. And my heart begins to beat. Day by day awaken me. You put the wind beneath my feet</segment2>
		<segment3>I long for the water. That brings life to me. 'cause I long for the truth, oh. That sets man free </segment3>
		<segment4>I am nothing without You. Only the dirt beneath Your nails. My heart is bruised and it's broken. And my soul is very frail</segment4>
		<segment5>Please give me a reason. I need to name this man. And no longer this broken treason. Only on You I will stand</segment5>
		<segment6>I long for the water. That brings life to me. 'cause I long for the truth, oh. That sets man free </segment6>
		<segment7>Please mend these broken wings. And take the scales from my eyes. Without You I am nothing. I will not survive x2</segment7>
		<segment8>I long for the water. That brings life to me. 'cause I long for the truth, oh. That sets man free     </segment8>
