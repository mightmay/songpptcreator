		<segment1>when all is said and all has come undone. when the sun, the moon and stars grow dark. before the days of youth are left in vain. before the dust reclaims its own again </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Breathe on me. Breathe oh Breath of God. Breathe on me. 'til my heart is new. Breathe on me. Breathe oh Breath of Life. Breathe on me. 'til I'm resting in you </segment2>
		<segment3>when all is said and all has come undone. restore the promise I made when I was young. now unto Him who can keep us from falling. and present us faultless before His glory </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Breathe on me. Breathe oh Breath of God. Breathe on me. `til my heart is new. Breathe on me. Breathe oh Breath of Life. Breathe on me. `til I'm resting in you.     </segment4>
