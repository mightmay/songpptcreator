		<segment1>What can I do with my obsession. With the things I cannot see. Is there madness in my being. Is it the wind that moves the trees?. Sometimes You're further than the moon. Sometimes You're closer than my skin. And You surround me like a winter fog. You've come and burned me with a kiss</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: And my heart burns for You. And my heart burns..Yeah. For you</segment2>
		<segment3>And I'm so filthy with my sin. And carry pride like a disease. And I'm so filthy with my sin. I carry pride like a disease. You know i'm stubborn, Lord, and I'm longing to be close. You burn me deeper than I know. And I feel lonely without hope. And I feel desperate without vision. You wrap around me like a winter coat. You come and free me like a bird</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: And my heart burns for You, You O Lord. And my heart.. Oh it burns for you, For you. And my heart.. Oh it burns for you, You O Lord. And my heart burns.. Yeah. For you, For you. For you, For you Lalalalalala. And my heart burns, Oh it burns, For you, You O Lord. And my heart, oh it burns for you, You, You, You, O Yeah yeah yeah. O Yeah yeah yeah. O Yeah yeah yeah. O Yeah yeah yeah. My heart burns.. for you</segment4>
		<segment5>My love for You. My heart for You. My life for You. All I have for You    </segment5>
