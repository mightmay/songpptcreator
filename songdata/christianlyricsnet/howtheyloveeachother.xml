		<segment1>Attitude check everybody's got x-ray vision. Spot a fake, walk away. 'Cause he's not worth my time, precious attention. Does it make you scared to think you stand for something bigger?. But will I ever know 'til you say it with your life?</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. How they love each other. How they shine. And they follow one. We would like to know ourselves</segment2>
		<segment3>Not your fancy talk, not your upright walk. They're not enough, so chalk one up for love again. Here's the same old good news. When you love, you give. And you can never lose, no never. Does it make you scared to think you. matter in the bigger picture?. But will I ever know 'til you say it with your life?</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Make a believer. Make a believer out of me. Just give me a reason. Give me a reason</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
