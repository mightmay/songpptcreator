		<segment1>In the time before the great fall. The power of fire was known to man. Imparted at creation as a vital component of the human soul. And the only knowledge that the enemy did not possess. And the reason that he deceived humanity. Many ages have passed since that time. When the evil one made his pact. When men were yet ignorant to the truth and easily deceived. In exchange for the keys to knowledge. Mankind gave up their immortal souls. Corrupted by the enemy. The souls were held. Encased in ice. Indefinitely.     </segment1>
