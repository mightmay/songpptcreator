		<segment1>I had another dream today. I gotta let it out. The media has lost it's brain- what's this all about?. The action, the drama has got me on my seat's edge all the time. TSN's been on my screen since I read the news last night. If it's true, then can someone let me know?. I need proof, that this rumor's not a joke. Is it a myth, a legend, an old wives tale?. I guess we'll see it through. If The Flames when Lord Stanley, then we all win it too    </segment1>
