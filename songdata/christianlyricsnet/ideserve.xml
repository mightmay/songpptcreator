		<segment1>I tasted fruit that was forbidden. I murdered trust that you had given. And now I'm living in a place that's not my home</segment1>
		<segment2>The pain in your heart made you regret. The moment we spoke, did you forget?. Will my transgressions bring us all to our sweet end?</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe I'm just being too hard on myself. I don't know. Or is it that your mercy is much more than I deserve?</segment3>
		<segment4>Betrayed by more than just a kiss. I did much more I must admit. Instead of letting it all end you bring new hope.     </segment4>
