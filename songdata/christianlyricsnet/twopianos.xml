		<segment1>You say to yourself, Nothing will shake me&amp;quot;. You take hold of the world to find yourself. You find yourself so empty.</segment1>
		<segment2>What have you let go of and for?. What have you let go of?</segment2>
		<segment3>You were a brother before you were a king. when you're determined what will you be?. You were a tower lifted up so tall. We have to gasp as we see the height from which you fall.</segment3>
		<segment4>You wanna hide beneith the pretty paint. You wanna be okay with everything. You wanna be transformed and stay the same. You wanna be dry in the rain.</segment4>
		<segment5>You loved you skin and dropped the &amp;quot;K&amp;quot;. You were called to be free. Do you wish again to be enslaved?. One hand to the sky, the other to your side. Clinging to a bag filled with two thousand dollar bills.</segment5>
		<segment6>What have you let go of and for?. What have you let go of?     </segment6>
