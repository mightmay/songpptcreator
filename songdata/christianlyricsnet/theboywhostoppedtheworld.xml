		<segment1>Don't think you could stop it now. I'd like to see you try somehow. Realize that it puts it all on you. There's nothing you can do</segment1>
		<segment2>Right now you're sick and tired. You're feeling sad, feeling uninspired. But the clock just won't slow down. Like it gets it kicks pushing you around</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe in the morning it won't be. Quite as bad as it seems</segment3>
		<segment4>The fact that you can't change. The speed of sound, the rate of age. Is an understatement to. A state of mind your not used to</segment4>
		<segment5>You'd be forever known. As the boy who stopped the world. And made it his own</segment5>
		<segment6>Right now you're sick and tired. You're feeling sad. feeling uninspired. So I pray for you my friend. That you'll fall down. You'll give in.     </segment6>
