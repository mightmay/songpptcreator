		<segment1>More than a superstition. When put in my position. Temptations and opinions. This heart's not my possession. Hold tight to your convictions. Hypocrites in all directions. Cling to the things your father taught you. Confess your sins to the One who bought you</segment1>
		<segment2>Do you feel all alone. Faith has alway kept you strong. If you could see my fear. Should I believe or should I doubt</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus:). I believe. In the things that you never told me. I believe. In the things that you never showed me. I believe. I know my fears control me. I believe. In the things that you never told me</segment3>
		<segment4>Aggressive passive inhibitions. Laughs before an indecision. Do I run or do I stay. When all I do may fall away. Lack of faith in what I trust. When all I measure turns to dust. When all I know decays in vain. And I am left alone again</segment4>
		<segment5>Do you feel all alone. Faith has always kept you strong. If you could see my fear. Should I believe or should I doubt</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>As I kneel in sanctuary. Crosses all arouned to haunt me. Architecture so divine. Bread, the body. Blood, the wine</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus 3x)    </segment8>
