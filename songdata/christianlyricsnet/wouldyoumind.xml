		<segment1>What now?. Hopelessly drinking water. From a well that is dry. Hopelessly drinking water. From a well that is empty now. But if you don't mind can I blame Him anyway?. But if you don't mind..it's easier that way. Which finger can I point?. Cause I never.. Cause I never believed.. Cause I never believed in God. But if you don't mind can I blame Him anyway?. But if you don't mind..it's easier that way. What else?. When all else seems to..it fails. What else?. When all else seems to..you fail. And I'll see you there!. And I'm alright!. Wake up!. Father.. Father.    </segment1>
