		<segment1>So proud to call you friend. So let down you're starting up again. The same old story a thousand times told. With you the hapless damsel in distress</segment1>
		<segment2>Am I richer than your King?. Will my two cents get you anything?</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I'll give you prayers and my time. Ev'ry moment of mine. All I have is yours to spend. But if you're hoping all your tears will dry. With words that I dispense, well. There're just some things that can't be bought with my. Two cents</segment3>
		<segment4>Still I'm so glad you call me friend. Just wond'ring when your pity parties end. When will you stop this bringing invitations. Wearing your same black party dress</segment4>
		<segment5>Am I richer than your King?. Will my two cents get you anything?</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>How can I have all your answers. When I've got questions of my own?</segment7>
		<segment8>I'll give you prayers and my time. Ev'ry moment of mine. All I have is yours to spend. But if you're hoping all your tears will dry. With words that I dispense, well. There're just some things that can't be bought with my, Bought with my, two cents.</segment8>
		<segment9>there's no other, such a friend and brother, tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus, alone. Why dont you tell it to Jesus alone.    </segment9>
