		<segment1>Death is all you know, in your life it shows, you mock the cross and all who believe in it. Darkness is all you bring. It's a melody of evil to me. Singing of death and destruction. Profit from the blood of the lost. That is your desire. Think that Hell is all fun and games. Satan grips your soul, your life he will own. Our God will not be mocked!. Blind eyes aren't open. Lost without a purpose. Writing songs of hopelessness (2x). Puppet of Destruction. Solo-Robert. Why can't you see your a puppet on a string. Satan pulls the strings and you follow him. What will you do when he turns his back on you. and the ones you think you control now control you. Blind eyes aren't open. Lost without a purpose. Writing songs of hopelessness (2x). Puppet of Destruction    </segment1>
