		<segment1>When the skin breaks. He thought time could heal his growing shame. These white hot knives will turn to fire and theyll burn. He stumbled out of the bedroom. Feel the shock moving up and down his spine. Hes running out of the building. Shes going crazy. Screaming, asking why? If you look for a savior to finally be free, free from all his failure, thats all youll ever see. He stumbled into the bathroom, shut the door and fell right to his knees. He tried to look in the the mirror. His eyes are bleeding. Hes asking please. When the skin breaks. He thought time could heal his growing shame. These white hot knives will turn to fire and theyll burn. He cannot heal before he breaks. Sounds weakening. Death sets in as his stomach quickly hits the floor. The stench of a rotting lie has found its way to your brain. It pulls the trigger and opens your eyes to spot the reeking stain. He thought it would solve all his problems. He sees now that the blood will never wash away. Now cant you hear what hes saying? While youve been screaming youve been drowning the ladder so you can float to the top instead of climb. And I assure you that Im not the one for you.     </segment1>
