		<segment1>You're about to feel a rush of blood run down your spine. You're about to taste a dose of your own medicine. I'm bending over backwards and I'm cutting it close. I put my life at risk for you. You're love for failure clearly shows. I'm better off to let you go. You only lead the darkest alleys. You're misleading me with you ghost. I felt so afraid when you showed up with your means to betray. &quot;OH NO!&quot; I'm tearing down all the memories of your face. Though I never saw you. I can recognize your taste of love. This can't be love. You haven't the slights what that means. Love is patient with no intentions to deceive.     </segment1>
