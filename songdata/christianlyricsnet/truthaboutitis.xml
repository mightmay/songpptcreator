		<segment1>It's not easy to be me, With all my philosophies and my flippant state of mind. I'd much rather take a nap than jump aloof and do all that, To worry what the crowd thinks of me tonight. </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm not asking you to love me. I'm just letting out the truth. No holds barred about what I feel, Nothing wrong with what I say. I'm not telling you to hate me, I just want you to relate. Don't forget about the message or the reason we're on stage. </segment2>
		<segment3>We once opted for a route wich included &quot;selling out.&quot;. I won't divulge that here now, so I digress. </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm not asking you to love me. I'm just letting out the truth. No holds barred about what I feel, Nothing wrong with what I say. I'm not telling you to hate me, I just want you to relate. Don't forget about the message or the reason we're on stage. </segment4>
		<segment5>The truth about it is that we only do it for the Lord.</segment5>
		<segment6>15. Great Literature. It's all in the way that I see things that you don't. It's all in me having a point of view that you can't. Touch or destruct, delay or confront, understand or construct. If I gave you answers you'd shove them right back in my face. What is real? Face up to the consequence of what will become. Your thoughts become numb. I can't wish you there. Could I make you care?.     </segment6>
