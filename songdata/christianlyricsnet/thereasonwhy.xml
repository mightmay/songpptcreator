		<segment1>I'm seein the sun, up in the sky, People round me, wonderin' why, I've got this joy, in my life, I know it's You, You're the reason why,</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm singing this song, to You Lord, To show You how much I love You, I love You, and I need You, I couldn't live my life without You.</segment2>
		<segment3>Mountains high, how deep the sea, I know its large, Your love for me, I've got this peace, and I am free, I know its You, You died for me,</segment3>
		<segment4>Without You, I'd be incomplete, and I'd be undone, I need more, of You Lord, in my life, Draw me closer, to You,</segment4>
		<segment5>I love You, You're the reason why, I know its You, You're the reason why, I've got this joy now in my life, You've given me peace, and I have no fear, Because I know that You are near, On and on my life's in You, On and on I will praise You, I love You, You're the reason why. </segment5>
