		<segment1>Maybe tomorrow we'll start over. Maybe tomorrow I will finally change my ways. Said the same things yesterday. Don't know why I'm so afraid. To let you in. To let you win. To let you have all of me</segment1>
		<segment2>Can't spend my whole life wastin'. Everything I know I've been given. 'Cause you've made for so much more than. Sittin' on the side lines. I don't wanna look back and wonder. If good enough could've been better</segment2>
		<segment3>Everyday's a day to start over. So, why am I waiting for tomorrow</segment3>
		<segment4>Maybe today I'll start believing. That you're mercy is really. As real as you say it is. It doesn't matter who I used to be. It only matters that I've been set free. You rescued me you're changing me. Jesus take everything</segment4>
		<segment5>Can't spend my whole life wastin'. Everything I know I've been given. 'Cause you've made for so much more than. Sittin' on the side lines. I don't wanna look back and wonder. If good enough could've been better</segment5>
		<segment6>Everyday's a day to start over. So, why am I waiting for tomorrow</segment6>

		<segment8>Can't spend my whole life wastin'. Everything I know I've been given. 'Cause you've made for so much more than. Sittin' on the side lines. I don't wanna look back and wonder. If good enough could've been better</segment8>
