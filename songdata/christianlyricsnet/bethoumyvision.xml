		<segment1>Be Thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart. Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art. Thou my best thought by day or by night. Waking more sleeping, Thy presence my light</segment1>
		<segment2>Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word. I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord. Thou my Great Father and I Thy true son. Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one</segment2>
		<segment3>Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise. Thou mine inheritance, now and always. Thou and Thou only, first in my heart. High King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art</segment3>
		<segment4>High King of Heaven, my victory won. May I reach heaven's joys, oh bright heaven's sun. Part of my young heart, whatever befall. Still be my vision, oh Ruler of all    </segment4>
