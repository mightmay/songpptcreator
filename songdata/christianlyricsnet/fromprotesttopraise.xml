		<segment1>I knew the times would come and now the times have landed. With stinging abrasion As ready as I seem to be. It's never like I planned it, yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>PRE CHORUS</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm wrestling my thoughts I'm overcome. Would you give me up I'm asking Lord. There's no where I sense Your presence here. So I will cry out, until I go</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>From Protest to praise. You're always amazing me. You're changing me slow, but surely. And You're gonna see me to the end</segment5>
		<segment6>How long will I be forgotten by You forever. You're not making sense here. Seems like eternity has made a home between us, yeah</segment6>
		<segment7>PRE CHORUS/CHORUS (2X)</segment7>
		<segment8>You're changing me slow. I just can't help but see it that way. Cuz You're gonna see me to the end    </segment8>
