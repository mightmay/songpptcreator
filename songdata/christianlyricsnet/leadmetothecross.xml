		<segment1>Savior I come. Quiet my soul remember. Redemptions hill. Where Your blood was spilled. For my ransom. Everything I once held dear. I count it all as lost</segment1>
		<segment2>Lead me to the cross. Where Your love poured out. Bring me to my knees. Lord I lay me down. Rid me of myself. I belong to You. Lead me, lead me to the cross</segment2>
		<segment3>You were as I. Tempted and trialed. You are. Te word became flesh. Bore my sin and death. Now you're risen</segment3>
		<segment4>To your heart. To your heart. Lead me to your heart. Lead me to your heart    </segment4>
