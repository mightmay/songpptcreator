		<segment1>Everybody praise the Lord. Every nation applause His name. For great is His love toward us. The faithfulness of the Lord endures. The faithfulness of the Lord endures. Forever. Be at rest once more my soul. For the Lord has been good to you. Be at rest once more oh my soul    </segment1>
