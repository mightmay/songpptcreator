		<segment1>When I was a kid. Puzzles were the best. You took a great memory and then you. Tore 'em all to shreds. Picking up the pieces. Remember where they fell. Couldn't find that one last piece to fill</segment1>
		<segment2>That empty well. Veins are runnin' dry. Confusion in my mind. Where's that one last piece, man, I think. I'm going blind. I'm sick of this jigsaw. I think I'm cracking up. Why can't I find the piece. That's lacking in my guts</segment2>
		<segment3>The top is off the box is gone. The puzzles laid out on the floor. I've held the piece in my hand. I know I've seen it here before. Empty space, incomplete. Is the puzzle of the soul. If I search on my knees I know I'll find. The peace that fills the hole. Searching through the what-if's. What about the maybe's. I think about the time that's spent</segment3>
		<segment4>Trying to separate these. Driven to the brink. Maybe pushing crazy. I have seen the enemy and the enemy is me. I can't fight any longer. The battle's already won. If I only saw it earlier. How could I have been so dumb. The piece was in the sky. Reflected in my eyes. Now my old self I hardly recognize    </segment4>
