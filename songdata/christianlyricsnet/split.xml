		<segment1>If You came by me would I crown You my King. Or brush You off as though I really didnt see. If You walked by my side would our souls then be unified. I swore Your name would never be denied</segment1>
		<segment2>But I took up this hammer. And laughed at all Your slander. And pierced Your hands. With the nails of blasphemy. How could I do this? I dont know. Said something forced me to it, so. Spit in Your face and passed You by. (Id forgotten those words &quot;your name wont be denied&quot;)</segment2>
		<segment3>But time and time again Id live that life of sin. I knew it hurt you bad but I wasnt ready to give in. &quot;Maybe someday,&quot; but not this day I said. I wanted to live my life I was willing to pay the price</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>But looking into my eyes I knew You felt this hearts cry. I needed You bad my life was oh so sad. But looking back at all this pain, this guilt, this strife. Would You take it all away if I were to give you back my life?</segment5>
		<segment6>But You said &quot;Ive forgiven thee&quot;. And You said &quot;Ive forgiven thee&quot; (repeat)</segment6>
		<segment7>He was hanging on a cross. With a crown of thorns in His head (repeat)</segment7>
		<segment8>But You said &quot;Ive forgiven thee&quot;. And You said &quot;Ive forgiven thee&quot; (repeat)    </segment8>
