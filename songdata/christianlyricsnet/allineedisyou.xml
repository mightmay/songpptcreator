		<segment1>Left my fear by the side of the road. Hear You speak. Won't let go. Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray</segment1>
		<segment2>Got every reason to be here again. Father's love that draws me in. And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You</segment2>
		<segment3>All I need is You. All I need is You Lord. Is you Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>One more day and it's not the same. Your spirit calls my heart to sing. Drawn to the voice of my Savior once again. Where would my soul be without Your Son. Gave His life to save the earth. Rest in the thought that You're watching over me</segment4>
		<segment5>All I need is You. All I need is You Lord. Is You Lord</segment5>
		<segment6>You hold the universe. You hold everyone on earth. You hold the universe. You hold. You hold</segment6>
		<segment7>All I need is You. All I need is You Lord. Is You Lord    </segment7>
