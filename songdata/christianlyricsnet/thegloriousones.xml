		<segment1>I am someone who got up again. I am someone unshakable. I have seen the earth spinning 'round. And now I understand</segment1>
		<segment2>They used to keep you on the outside. Now you're the only survivor. You have spoken with the angels. And your face still shines. Just like mine</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: We're The Glorious Ones. The Glorious Ones. Forever in the sun, we are. The Glorious Ones</segment3>
		<segment4>And tonight we are the strangers. In the darkness underground. We have eternal things in out hands. And tomorrow we rise. So wise</segment4>
