		<segment2>Verse 1: You ask us where the guns at homie where the weed at/ we like kill that homeboy we dont need that/ instead of the heat well be where G-O-Ds at/ so we reachin out with open arms like where your sleeves at/ I notice something catsll die for they reputation/ they rather die disin God and to get with Satan/ but on this side we collide in anticipation/ of Jesus second coming written in Revelation/ we dont grip steel sell crack none of that/ we live life in light of the fact Hes coming back/ so while they squeeze clips blood crip gang banging/ east coast west coast down south slanging/ Midwest nina poppinseein Jesus hangin/ on the cross resurrected and you still thinkin/ that you cool without His grace is crazy/ its a slap to the face of the God who made me and you</segment2>

		<segment4>Verse 2: We kissed the world goodbye/ and its love for women its love for sinning/ simply because His love is in us/ we kissed the world goodbye/ and its music too that musics confused dudes like a rubrics cube/ homie /now we pluggin into Christian rap/ so many lyrics about Christ a make a Christian snap/ and wanna spread love to a thug with a nine milli/ and I aint playin this time dirty and Im silly/and every movie and commercial that makes fun of us/ like South Park with wicked hearts that come up/ and comic view and Islamic dudes that do it too/ one day the Bible say theyll pay homage too/ the very King that they mocked and laughed at/ the Bible says at they very plots He laughs back/ so we gone love our enemies and we gone have fun/ as we patiently wait on the return of the Son/ homie     </segment4>
