		<segment1>March of 1981 is a time I will never. forget. I was completely gone (for you deb!)</segment1>
		<segment2>I see you smiling at me. And I fall into a daydream. Don't know what all of this means. Oh, is it love?. Logic is slipping away. My heart's on a runaway train</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm gone, yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone and. It feels so right</segment3>
		<segment4>Each time I look in your eyes. So glad you came into my life. Much more than an emotional high. Oh, this is love. I know that I've made up my mind. I'll stay for the rest of my life    </segment4>
