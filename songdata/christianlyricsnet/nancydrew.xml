		<segment1>I got this thing for Nancy Drew. Her hair is blonde her eyes are blue. Yeah, I think that I'm falling in love. I wish she'd say she'd marry me, and why she won't is a mystery. Yeah, I know its me she thinks of. Nancy Drew, I love you (Yes I do). One time these criminals with their guns-they thought it would be fun to try and kill my Nancy Drew. I jumped out and saved her life, then asked her to be my wife. She said, &quot;No, I'll never marry you!&quot; It's a really big mystery. I'll put the Hardy Boys on the case. Cause no time in history has someone denied my face.     </segment1>
