		<segment1>&quot;I'm here for you&quot; she said. &quot;And we can stay for awhile, My boyfriends gone, We can just pretend.&quot;. Last I need no introduction, Now whos the greater sin, Your drived by sin to revive, (tell me darling) Where do we begin.</segment1>
		<segment2>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your Kiss. Your Clothes. Your Clutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your Lips. Your Lies. Your Lust. Like the devils in your hands</segment2>
		<segment3>Everyone in this town. is seeing somebody else. Everybody tired of someone. Our eyes wander for help. Prayers that need no answer now. I'm tired of who I am. You were my greatest mistake. I fell in love with your sin. You littlest sin</segment3>
		<segment4>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your Kiss. Your Clothes. Your Clutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your Lips. Your Lies. Your Lust. Like the devils in your hands</segment4>
		<segment5>Failure is our disease. You broke my heart, my joy. You brought my greatest failure. Discourse wont save myself</segment5>
		<segment6>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your Kiss. Your Clothes. Your Clutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your Lips. Your Lies. Your Lust. Like the devils in your hands</segment6>
		<segment7>Was this over before. Before it ever began. Your Kiss. Your Clothes. Your Clutch. Like the devils got your hand. This was over before. Before it ever began. Your Lips. Your Lies. Your Lust. Like the devils in your hands    </segment7>
