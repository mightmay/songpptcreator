		<segment1>When I feel you close to me. It's easy to believe. To the depths and back again. To find that I'm still needing. Feel the fear dissipate. When you are everything you are. Feel my soul come awake. You carry me away </segment1>
		<segment2>When I hurt, when I bleed. You're holding me. Feel you scratching at the surface. Under my skin (2x) </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, under my skin (2x) </segment3>
		<segment4>Oh the sweet serenity. I'm beautifully addicted. You are more than I can take. I crave you undiluted. You calm the ache, I come awake. When you are everything you are. Feel the fear dissipate. You carry me away </segment4>
		<segment5>When I hurt, when I bleed. You're holding me. Feel you scratching at the surface. Under my skin (2x) </segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, under my skin (2x) </segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, yeah </segment7>
		<segment8>Could I be lost. Could I disappear. Could I be lost. Would you find me here?. Could I be lost in a secret place?. Could I rest in the shadow of your face </segment8>
		<segment9>Oh the sweet. (Could I be lost, could I disapper?). Serenity. (Could I be lost, would you find me here?). Beautifully. (Could I be lost in a secret place?). A part of me. (Could I rest in the shadow of your face?) </segment9>
		<segment10>When I hurt, when I bleed. You're holding me. Feel you scratching at the surface. Under my skin (2x) </segment10>
		<segment11>Oh, under my skin (4x) </segment11>
		<segment12>    </segment12>
