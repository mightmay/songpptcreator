		<segment1>Verse 1. Cars, mansions and planes. Income that never refrains. The more you receive, the less you believe. In His name</segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 2. There will come a day. When this will all pass away. The world will die and millions will cry. To be saved</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. King of Kings. And Lord of all is He. Come and be a part of the reign</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 3. Pride, fortune and fame. Glory given to your name. A heart filled with greed is planting a seed. With no shame</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 4. There will come a day. When you will soon pass away. The Son will deny and then you will cry. To be saved</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat Chorus    </segment6>
