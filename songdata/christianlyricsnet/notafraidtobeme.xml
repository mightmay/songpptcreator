		<segment1>Ive got a new way of living now a little less of a lot. A little more of nothing. Thought you might have seen the change in me. Little quicker to listen little slower to speak</segment1>
		<segment2>I was wrong when I said I was strong I am weak and I need. All that you have to give. I cannot keep the voices quiet inside. Hear them sing hear the scream, at least I know Im alive</segment2>
		<segment3>Now I am meeting myself and I am liking what I see. I am not afraid anymore Not afraid to be bored. Not afraid to be me</segment3>
		<segment4>Every battle leads to another war. Every day Im reminded of what Im fighting for. Its never easy and its never the same. But its worth all Ive got and so Ill give it again</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I dont know why, I dont know why. But it makes me want to cry, cry</segment5>
		<segment6>I am meeting myself and I am ready to see. Truth can break our heart that is when it will start. To set us free    </segment6>
