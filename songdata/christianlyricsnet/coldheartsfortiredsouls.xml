		<segment1>Life has taken this road. And our lives are joined in the fight. We have heard the choir laughing. Their words are meaningless. We will always have each other. They truly think they always know. We will always be together. They will always be alone</segment1>
		<segment2>Our dreams they bleed. But the wounds are real. Real inside. Our dreams they bleed. But the wounds will heal</segment2>
		<segment3>Move without the need to. Try and justify our reasons. For how and why we do this. Their chill wont break us down. The catch is always cold. But their hearts are always colder. We can try and train our feelings. But the fact remains the same</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>Life will never scar us. Despite their cry for justice. All the names they hide mean nothing. Their names are always fake</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus]</segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
