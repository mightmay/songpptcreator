		<segment1>The fight is over, the bright lights turned somehow. The strength I have is running out, the current pulls me down</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm wondering</segment2>
		<segment3>Is anybody out there who's cold and incomplete inside. I can hear Him calling. Come and follow me, my child</segment3>
		<segment4>The twilight turns to day, with all your love displayed. The stars they bow in awe, when the lost return to you</segment4>
		<segment5>Draws up my heart deep from the well. I know He's finding every lost and broken dream    </segment5>
