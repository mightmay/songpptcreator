		<segment1>Verse 1: Just a man. No more. Maybe not what you were hoping for. Made mistakes, God knows, But I've always tried for. Something more. If I try to explain. And the words don't come. That easy for me, Listen patiently. And I'll try to tell you. Just how I feel. </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: All of my life, All of my love. All that I'm ever, ever dreaming of, All of my strength. And all of my weakness. These are all the things. That I have to give, All of me. </segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Sometimes a fool, sometimes wise, Just like a child. When I look in your eyes. I see my future, I feel the past. Now I can see just what. I really have. With the words in my hand. Still they always seem to. Get in the way, Just one tear filled dance, Maybe then you'll know. What I'm trying to say. </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus:.    </segment4>
