		<segment1>Bring rivers in this wasteland. Clouds into this sky. Bring springs of life into the wells that have been run dry</segment1>
		<segment2>Rise up in this city. Gather in this light. Fall down on your people. Your glory and your life</segment2>
		<segment3>Rain. Lord we thirst for water. Rain. We are desert Land. Rain. On your sons and daughters. Rain. Bring your rain again</segment3>
		<segment4>Speak dreams into this water. And vision to this land. That oceans be divided. And bring forth life again</segment4>
		<segment5>Rise up in this city. Gather in this light. Fall down on your people. Your glory and your life</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS x 2</segment6>
		<segment7>Let the tide roll in. Washing over our lives. Let your water fall again</segment7>
