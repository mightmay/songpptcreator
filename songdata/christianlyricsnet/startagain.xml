		<segment1>And I remember everything, Everything I loved, I gave it away like it wasnt enough. All the words I said and all you forgive. How could I hurt you again?</segment1>
		<segment2>What if I let you in?. What if I make it right it?. What if I give it up?. What if I want to try?. What if you take a chance?. What if I learn to love?. What if, what if we start again?</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). All this time. I can make it right. With one more try. Can we start again?. In my eyes, You can see it now, Can we start again, can we start again?!?</segment3>
		<segment4>Emptiness inside me, wonder if you see. Its my mistake and its hurting me. I known where weve been. How did we get so far?. What if, what if we start again?. (Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Im lost inside the pain I feel without you, I cant stop holding on, I need you with me!!!. Im trapped inside the pain. Can we never love again?. Im lost without you!!!</segment5>
		<segment6>One more try, Can we start again?. In my eyes, can you forgive me now?. (Can we start again?). Can we start again (one more try?). Can we start again?. Can we start again (can you forgive me?). Can we start again?.     </segment6>
