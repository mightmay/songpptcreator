		<segment1>everytime I turn the TV on. see another pretty face on the screen. feels like I'm not good enough. to be on the cover of a magazine. turn around, I look in the mirror </segment1>
		<segment2>and I wonder if ill ever measure up. all I want is someone to make it clearer. am I ever gonna find the perfect love? </segment2>
		<segment3>then You break through the madness. and You tell me how it is. </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). You're a diamond that shines. one of a kind. a shimmering radiant star. You're a flower in the rain. wonderfully made. to shine like the sun. You're a diamond </segment4>
		<segment5>friends try and tell me just to loosen up a little. You're gonna scare the good ones away. get a look with a hook, its fundamental. come on girl, u gotta get into the game. something deep inside of me says </segment5>
		<segment6>are u sure that u really want to play?. gotta trust ur heart and not ur head. instead of buying into the masquerade. I'm not some decoration. so would u tell me how it is.. (chorus) </segment6>
		<segment7>doesn't matter if they tell u how to live </segment7>
		<segment8>doesn't matter if they try and mold u. doesn't matter if they say what beautiful is. You're a diamond cause He already showed u </segment8>
		<segment9>(chorus).     </segment9>
