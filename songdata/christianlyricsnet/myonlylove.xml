		<segment1>I still want you. Yes, I need you To have and to hold you After all of these years. I will listen to your problems. Won't try to fix them, Just wipe away your tears. And if you need me in the middle of the night, my dear, I' ll stay awake till morning light And chase away your fears. So come closer, Right here, forever. Deep in my heartbeat, Together as one. My only love. Cause if you need me in the middle of the night, my dear, I' ll stay awake till morning light And chase away your fears. So come closer, Right here forever. Deep in my heartbeat, Together as one. My only love, My only love, My only love    </segment1>
