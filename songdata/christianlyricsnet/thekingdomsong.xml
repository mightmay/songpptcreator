		<segment1>Verse: From eternity to eternity Your kingdom will ever reign. You are the one God, Jesus, And we bear Your name. From the rulers north, to the rulers south. To the kingdoms east and west. They'll bow before You. Your Lordship confess</segment1>
		<segment2>Bridge: Your oceans clap their hands. Your trees they wave their branches. Your rivers run with praise. All creation will praise</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Lord we delight in Your truth. Your kingdom's advancing. And Lord we are moving with You. Lord, we delight in Your reign. Creation will praise You. And Lord we exalt Your great name    </segment3>
