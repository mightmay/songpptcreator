		<segment1>talk strays when you're right. so drive straight when you drive. does it finish off that season. and the finish of that life</segment1>
		<segment2>to get what you always want. to get another try. to find that party. you break all your family ties</segment2>
		<segment3>new wife. new life</segment3>
		<segment4>chest pains when you lie. so talk strays when you try</segment4>
		<segment5>to get what you always want. to get another try. to find that party. you break all your family ties</segment5>
