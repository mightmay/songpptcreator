		<segment1>It doesnt get. Any lower than this. Lonely, abandoned and helpless. How could i feel. Any worse than now. Is it too late to escape. Or get out somehow</segment1>
		<segment2>Wont you come and rain down. Wont you come and rain down</segment2>
		<segment3>In the darkest room. Theres a light on for you. If youre too weak to move. Hes your strength. When your nights turn cold. And you think nobody knows. Its jesus that understands</segment3>
		<segment4>Im glad to see. Youre not leaving me. Empty, rejected and hurting. And i know. That its better now. You mend my broken heart. When i am broken down</segment4>
		<segment5>Wont you come and rain down. Wont you come and rain down</segment5>
		<segment6>In the darkest room. Theres a light on for you. If youre too weak to move. Hes your strength. When your nights turn cold. And you think nobody knows. Its jesus that understands</segment6>
		<segment7>Wont you come. And rain down on me jesus. On me jesus. Wont you come. And rain down on me jesus. On me jesus    </segment7>
