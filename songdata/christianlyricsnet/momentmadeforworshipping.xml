		<segment1>6:30 Monday morning Im here hiding in my bed. A song plays on my alarm clock as I cover up my head. And somewhere in the distance I remember yesterday. Singing Hallelujah full of wonder awe and praise. But now Im just wondering why I dont feel anything at all</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: This is a moment made for worshipping. Cause this is a moment Im alive. This is a moment I was made to sing. A song of living sacrifice. For every moment that I live and breathe. This is a moment made for worshipping</segment2>
		<segment3>When Im praying with my children as theyre running off to school. When I kiss my wife good morning just to say I still love you. When Im feeling loved and happy, when Im feeling all alone. When Im failing to remember all the love that Ive been shown. Every beat of my heart is another new place to start to know</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Every single beat of my heart is another new place to startRight now</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>From the rising of the sun. To the setting of the sun. The name of the Lord is worthy to be praised</segment7>
		<segment8>From the rising of the sun. To the setting of the sun. The name of the Lord is worthy to be praised </segment8>
		<segment9>. .     </segment9>
