		<segment1>You've been hiding now for so long. Never understanding why. Running far away from the truth. And all along chasing after lies</segment1>
		<segment2>I have loved you from the beginning. Long before you knew my name. Even though you've broken my heart. I'll love you just the same. I'll love you anyway</segment2>
		<segment3>Never mind your worries. Never mind your fears. They can only take you far from me. When you feel there's nowhere. Left for you to turn. Well, I got all you want. And everything you need. Come on back to me</segment3>
		<segment4>Do you believe in second chances. Or in a love that never fades. Put your faith in what you can't see. Just put your hand in mine. And I'll show you the way    </segment4>
