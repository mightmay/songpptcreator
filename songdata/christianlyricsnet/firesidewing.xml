		<segment1>This world may tell me not to turn it all the way. It's the last thing I need cause you're better anyway. Take it from me. I don't want these things that I'm giving up. I don't know. I just don't want to hear that I told you so</segment1>
		<segment2>And you're not who I've heard about. But you're someone I need. And you're not who I've figured out</segment2>
		<segment3>It's my first time falling and I'm finishing all the way. And you're all that I would need cause you're better anyway. Take it from me. Cause I've seen things that you've taught about. I don't know. It's the last thing that I would ever have know</segment3>
		<segment4>And you're not who I've heard about. But you're someone I need. And you're not who I've figured out</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes, I feel like I'm alive. And you love, and you give, and you do it so well. And I can't even come to convince myself. (And I can't even come to convince myself). Myself. (And I can't even come to convince myself). Myself</segment5>
		<segment6>And you're not who I've heard about. But you're someone I need. And you're not who I've figured out</segment6>
		<segment7>And you're not who I've heard about. But you're someone I need. And you're not who I've figured out    </segment7>
