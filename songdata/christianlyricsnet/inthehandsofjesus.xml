		<segment1>What does tomorrow hold. Nobody really knows. The future is never ours to see. So much uncertainty. Still we keep holding on to. Yesterday, when yesterday is gone. But even in the darkest night, we're safe inside His love. And that's where we still stay</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. In the hands of Jesus, we remain until we're home. Standing together, come what may. For we know that we will not be moved. We will remain in Jesus' hands</segment2>
		<segment3>Just let your fear subside. Here it is safe inside. And though every storm is hard to see. We are bound by unity</segment3>
		<segment4>For even as we struggle in our battle, We know the victory is won. And no power on this earth can ever separate us now. We're in the hands of God</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. We will remain. In the hands of our Savior. We will remain. Even in our weakest hour. The power that strengthens us will never die. It will stand the test of time. Throughout all time</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus    </segment7>
