		<segment1>The current state of things leaves my feet numb. How much longer must we walk. Through endless snow.</segment1>
		<segment2>My vision gets blurred. Until this whiteout blinds me. But I, I will walk by faith.</segment2>
		<segment3>These dark clouds remain from ages past. A fire burns within. My only warmth.</segment3>
		<segment4>I can see my breath uttering words of hope. Glimpses of the sun penetrate in me.</segment4>
		<segment5>. (This winter, this winter, this winter). This winter will end. (This winter, this winter, this winter). This winter will end. (This winter, this winter, this winter). This winter will end. (This winter, this winter, this winter). This winter will end    </segment5>
