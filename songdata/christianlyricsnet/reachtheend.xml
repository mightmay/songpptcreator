		<segment1>This is for all those who search for something more. Never give up, never give in. When words have no meaning. Because your time in hell has left you cold and alone. What was thought to be good in the world. Gave you the back of their hand. The breath of life has become empty, without feeling. So you bury your head and distance yourself. The dreams still wake you in tears and nightmares, battery and anguish. Tears, nightmares, Battery and anguish. All that's good in the world can be wrecked in such a short time. And then you'll wonder, is the end near?. Take a chance, just one time. Make ready your heart tonight. And you sing: Is this the end? This is all I have. Love is here now that you're at your end    </segment1>
