		<segment1>All her wants to fill a need. She wants to save you with her bandages after she makes you bleed. Like a vampire, a parasite. Stretch the neck of her victim, she finds her prey in broad daylight. So when you're up, she's down, down she's up, it whips around. It's the ride the way that she needs it. </segment1>
		<segment2>Whatever she wanted for whatever you need. Speechless and silent while she takes everything. </segment2>
		<segment3>Kryptonite underneath; you used to be her superman, but now you're fading, now your weak. Never how or why it worked to play the big lie. To dim the truth from causing her wet eyes. </segment3>
		<segment4>Whatever she wanted for whatever you need. Speechless and silent while she takes everything. </segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, whatever she wanted for whatever you need. Speechless and silent while she takes everything. </segment5>
		<segment6>Yeah, whatever she wanted for whatever you need. Speechless and silent while she takes everything. </segment6>
		<segment7>She takes everything. Whatever she wants. It's everything.     </segment7>
