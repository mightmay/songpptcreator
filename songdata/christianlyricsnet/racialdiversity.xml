		<segment1>Verse 1: Let us remove any muzzle thats been keepin us quiet/ from speakin about Jesus died for a colorful bride/ He purchased a people from every nation tongue and tribe/ read the wordsin Revelations chapter 5 verse 9/ and you will see/ Gods pursuit for racial diversity/ and harmony at an infinite cost the emergency is/ for His people to that the urgency is/ for us/ to put much/ emphasis on diversity plus/ and its hurtin me cause/ that its certainly us/ who ignore the purpose of Him dispersin His blood/ at the center of the crucifixion/ though its cruel and its sickening/ we can see that God He has proved His intentions to us/ to be unified as kings and priests/ but since Jesus died seems like these things done ceased/ Sunday mornin see us separate/ early we awake/ to worship our God and go our separate ways/ why?</segment1>
		<segment2>Hook: Let us be one in you/ the way you want us to/ multicultural as we walk together in love for the world to see (repeat)</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Ask John Newton the same dude who used to trade them slaves/ was changed and wrote Amazing Grace/ an ex-racist/ he must of recognized that blacks like whites like Asians/ cause of Christ even have secure places/ let us pray this/ because a kingdom divided against itself will not stand in its places/ let us pray to be free from hostility/ from prejudiceness mistreatin to peace and tranquility/ plus no more racist jokes no more suspicions/ no more disgust or ridicule among Christians/ dont call it black church/ dont call it white church/ cause when we look in the scriptures we see its Christ church</segment3>
		<segment4>Hook</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 3: Let us be concerned that we lovin the way we see Jesus lovin/ every ethnicity and every color/ cause this is Gods will/ can we hang out together outside of the church settin?/ here on earth can we have a dress rehearsal for heaven/ that would be excellent just to see us worship together/ and hangin out as we learn about each others endeavors/ I know it sounds scary comin out your comfort zone/ but thats the way its gone be when Jesus come takes us home/ so let us prepare an intentional plan and a way/ and come together and stop stayin away from each other/ my sister my brother no matter your color I love ya/ lets be like Jesus and start prayin for each other</segment5>
