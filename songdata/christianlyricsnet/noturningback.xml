		<segment1>She's a bright light, look for too long and you'll go blind. Losing sight of the line. She's a bright light, it's hard to run once she's inside. While you feel alive, she's watching you die </segment1>
		<segment2>The fight is closing in, it's time to hold our ground. No turning back, no turning back. The longer that we run, the weaker we become. No turning back, no turning back </segment2>
		<segment3>We've been taught that conflict is a lack of tolerance. And tolerance today is King. I have learned that all the things that plague us chase us down. No matter how well we hide, no matter how far we run </segment3>
		<segment4>Give me liberty from death. Give me liberty or give me death.     </segment4>
