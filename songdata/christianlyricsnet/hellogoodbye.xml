		<segment1>Wheres the navigator of your destiny. Where is the dealer of this hand. Who can explain. Life and its brevity. Cause there is nothing here. That I can understand. You and I. Have barely met. And I just dont want to let go of you yet</segment1>
		<segment2>Noah, sweet child of mine. Ill see you on the other side</segment2>
		<segment3>And so I hold your tiny hand in mine. For the hardest thing Ive ever had to face. Heaven calls for you. Before it calls for me. When you get there save me a place. A place where I can share your smile. And I can hold you for more than just awhile    </segment3>
