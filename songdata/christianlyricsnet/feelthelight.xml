		<segment1>Today today you wanna run away now. You break try to keep it together. Love, love is all you need. You're a queen yet you've never know it. Life has come and left you blinded. Stole your smile and left you cryin. Its now you fault but. shame is all you got now</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Your heart is tangeled up in silence. It's time to let go and feel the light. You'll find your not alone. I know its easier to hide. but you gotta let go and feel the light. Let go and feel the light</segment2>
		<segment3>Be brave ,brave. Waters all aroung you. I'll stay try to keep you from. sinking down. Love, love is on your side. It's stronger then you'll ever know</segment3>
		<segment4>So many years of quiet. Building up like a fire inside. your minds a war. get out, get out and live for more. There's so much more. Live for moreeee</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus:</segment5>
		<segment6>. Be brave, brave waters alll around you. I'll stay try to keep you from sinking down </segment6>
