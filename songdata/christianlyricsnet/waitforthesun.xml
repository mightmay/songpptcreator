		<segment1>Love will always stay. Somewhere in your heart. And hope will never fade. Though at times it will be hard. But lift your head anyway. God's Son is returning. He's bringing brighter days</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). So wait for the sun to come out again. Storms always come but they blow away with the wind. So wait for the Son is coming again. Winds of trial blow hard. So we've got to hang on. Hang on to Him</segment2>
		<segment3>Where's the joy you've known. It seems you can't remember. All the fire in your life. Has turned to cold december. But lift your head anyhow. He's won greater battles before. What makes you think He won't fight now?</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus 2x)</segment4>
		<segment5>Let the sun shine. Let the sun shine in. The sun shine in (6x)    </segment5>
