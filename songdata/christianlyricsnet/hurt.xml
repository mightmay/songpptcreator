		<segment1>Drop the ball, watch it fall far below. Suck you in, hold your breath. The undertow creeps in slow. Everyone owns a gun deep inside. It's just a matter of how much you let it slide</segment1>
		<segment2>Help me, help you. They won't be there. Help me, help you. They won't see</segment2>
		<segment3>It hurts when you need me. And I can't break your fall. And it hurts when you can't see. And it hurts</segment3>
		<segment4>Drop the switch, scratch the itch, watch it glow. inch by inch, the cutting board. Watch it swing to and fro. Everyone carries one deep inside. It's just a matter of how much you let it slide</segment4>
		<segment5>And it hurts when you're lonely. And I'm standing right beside you there. And it hurts when you told me. That you'll try this on your own</segment5>
		<segment6>Hope you never hurt, hope you never cry. Hope you never lose your way tonight. Hope you never crumble, hope you never fall. Hope you never throw away it</segment6>
		<segment7>Drop the ball, watch it fall below far below. Suck you in, hold your breath, watch it swing    </segment7>
