		<segment1>Too many hypocrites, I heard her say. I even saw it in the headlines today. How can I follow God when His own people turn away. She said, nobodys perfect but I just want to see. Somebody living what they say the believe. If theyve got all this world needs like they say. I wonder why wont they give some away</segment1>
		<segment2>Can she see God for who He really is. In what she sees in you and me. Can she see God for who He really. For who He really is is all she really needs to see</segment2>
		<segment3>He slips into church and he puts up his guard. They look so happy but his lifes been so hard. He keeps his distance so they wont see the scars. Its just religion thats all dressed up in white. And God is love as long as youre living right. But does he know that Jesus also has scars. And His love can reach him no matter how far</segment3>
		<segment4>Can he see God for who He really is. In what he sees in you and me. Can he see God for who He really. For who He really is, is all he really needs to see</segment4>
		<segment5>The skeptics are watching to see who will fall. While those disillusioned search for the truth in it all. Maybe today well cross their paths unaware. And theyll stop and look at us. What will be there?</segment5>
		<segment6>Can they see God for who He really is. In what they see in you and me. Can they see God for who He really. For who He really is, is all they really need to see.     </segment6>
