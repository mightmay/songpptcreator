		<segment1>I have not much. To offer You. Not near what You deserve. But still I come. Because Your cross. Has placed in me my worth</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, Christ my King. Of sympathy. Whose wounds secure my peace. Your grace extends. To call me friend. Your mercy sets me free</segment2>
		<segment3>And I know I'm weak. I know I'm unworthy. To call upon Your name. But because of grace. Because of Your mercy. I stand here unashamed</segment3>
		<segment4>I can't explain. This kind of love. I'm humbled and amazed. That You'd come down. From heavens heights. And greet me face to face</segment4>
		<segment5>Here I am at Your feet. In my brokeness complete    </segment5>
