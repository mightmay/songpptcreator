		<segment1>Maybelline Queens with plastic faces. Modeling their hips and their lips. Bleed yourselves again. 'cause your beauty is only skin deep. Following your cold surroundings.</segment1>
		<segment2>It's all you have. Holding on. Holding on. To nothing. A hole you have. In your heart. It needs heart, it needs something</segment2>
		<segment3>Wrapped up in your vanity. Put on your mask every morning. Scrape it off at the end of a long, long day</segment3>
		<segment4>Maybelline Queens with plastic faces. Modeling their hips and their lips.</segment4>
		<segment5>It's all you have. Holding on. Holding on. To nothing. A hole you have. In your heart. It needs heart, it needs something    </segment5>
