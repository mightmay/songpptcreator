		<segment1>All the wretched things have done are now submerged in. Blood, who is responsible for all of this love?. It's true, we cannot live without forgiveness.</segment1>
		<segment2>I try so hard to live above the world, Selfish lies give me more and more grief?. We still store our treasures here, so easily destroyed.</segment2>
		<segment3>The final time, I close my eyes. I will open them in paradise.</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I realise I am nothing but a. Clone, made from dust by someone learning to love, Like you do eternally, always true.</segment4>
		<segment5>I want to be nothing more than a man, Only yours, I'll be the big son, one who you hold close. To your heart eternally, never apart.</segment5>
		<segment6>The final time, I close my eyes. I will open them in paradise. Dear ties??</segment6>
		<segment7>The final time, I close my eyes. I will open them in paradise. The final time, I close my eyes. I will open them in paradise.     </segment7>
