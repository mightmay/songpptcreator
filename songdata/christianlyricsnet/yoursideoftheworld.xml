		<segment1>So here we are were standing face to face. And yet we seem to be a million miles apart. This world can feel like such a lonely place. It all depends on what you see from where you are. So please, please tell me what you can cause I want to understand</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: How does it look from your side. How does it look from where you are. How does it look from your side, from your side of the world</segment2>
		<segment3>So tell me the color of your sky above. Paint me a picture of the things that make you smile. Show me your fears and what youre dreaming of. Take me to where my heart can see across the miles. So please, please tell me what you can cause I want to understand</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus </segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: Dont be surprised to find that Im not too far away. Cause what we are both in search of is one and the same. So please please tell me what you see. Cause I really want to be the one who understands</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus.     </segment6>
