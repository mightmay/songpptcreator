		<segment1>It's 8:03 and you woke up away from me. Tomorrow yet another worry. It's 8:15 and already you livin in that stressativity. So soon your mind is blanking. Mind is spinning in complex without me. So give me your coffee give me your cream. Give me your stressin everything. It's so easy to be blind by animosity. Relax your eyes and sing free to be. Oh child won't you sing to me. And if you think your life is under control. And if you think you're livin under control. Cuz only the fool leaneth on his own. And so I sing to you with all my soul. Free to be without worry no more worry. Yes I'm free to be without worry. No more worry. 123 a.m. and the house is burning down. 4 a.m. the I AM grain of sand I am. You work me not to worry. Yeah You woke me up not to worry. But what should I drink. What should I wear. what should I eah. Where should I sleep. Who gives me everything He gives me everything. So burn house burn down. Joshua Joshua's house burned down. And you think your life is under control. And if you think your life is under control. And if you think your living under control. Cuz only the fool leanth on his own. And so I sing to you with all my soul. Free to be without worry. No more worry.. I need Your release to be in me. I need your beat to be my release. You gave me that sea to remind me. Your peace Jehovah won't You draw near me    </segment1>
