		<segment1>I know that you get overwhelmed. But just relax. You feel like time is running out. And you could fall between the cracks. And nothing that you've ever done. Is ever good enough</segment1>
		<segment2>Breathe in now. Receive another name. Breathe in now. Live without the blame</segment2>
		<segment3>I know you haven't figured out. What happens next. You feel like you have lost your way. 'Cause you don't know which way to step. It feels like every time you try to walk you only crawl. Just open up your eyes and know that I won't let you fall</segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause all you ever wanted. And all you ever needed. Is waiting here with me. You have all been livin'. A life I have forgiven. So know that you are free. Know that you are free</segment4>
		<segment5>And You say..    </segment5>
