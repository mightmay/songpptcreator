		<segment1>You know it's time for us to step it up. Another level now 'cause we finished warming up. So we rise up elevate to maintain fill up with octane. And fan the flame we regain all the names. The enemy took away. And like a green beret we will lead the way. Into battle so have no fear we will draw near. So that we can persevere like a gondolier. We headed straight to the top nonstop. Set shop at the top of the Rock. You'll feel the aftershock after we rock the spot. Cause you forgot these soldiers won't turn and walk. We take hard knocks come back for more. Cause we're hardcore we fight for the One who died for (you). And like Saigon we're on the frontlines. And we carry on to the end times</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>Now that it's on, we're out in the front of this marathon. With our armor on, stay strong we drive on (drive on). Our echelon pressin' on 'til we reach the top. And you know we don't stop (our echelon). Now that it's on</segment3>
		<segment4>We're on the enemy's hit list. I'm hopin' you get this. You're takin' a risk when you resist the one who made you exist. Evolutionists we got love for you too but we're breakin' down. Walls seeking out the truth. I'm a soldier in this army of One. Like I told ya the battle's already won. So about face move outta the way I gotta pray for you. And this is how we do</segment4>
