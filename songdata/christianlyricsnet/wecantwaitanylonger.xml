		<segment1>A silent call from a distant land. Crying for a helping hand, so. How long will it go on?. Ignorance and vanity. Supercede humanity, so. How long it will go on?. I want to know how long will it go on?</segment1>
		<segment2>We can't wait any longer. They crying out, doesn't matter. We can't wait any longer. No, no. Too long in a slumber. Shake it up,wake it up now. We can't any longer. No, no.</segment2>
		<segment3>Another child is laid to rest. Another day of hopelessnes, so. How long it will go on?. And every day we're on the fence brings. Another fatal consequence, so. How long will it go on?. I want to know, how long will it go on?</segment3>
		<segment4>Yuko awezayo kusikia kilio chetu? (Can somebody hear us crying out?). Twaomba msaada wenu (Somebody help us). Aweko mwenye kuttuoka (Somebody save us). Aweko mwenye kutupa uhuru (Somebody free us)    </segment4>
