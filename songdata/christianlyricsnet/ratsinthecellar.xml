		<segment1>You were not supposed to be here. You were not supposed to see this. This is not me, this is not me. This something acting on this body</segment1>
		<segment2>You should not have come so suddenly. You should have knocked and you wouldnt have seen. Rats in the cellar, rats in the cellar. Just ignore the vermin and forget the whole thing</segment2>
		<segment3>The truth wont hide. What sort of man am I?. To set these traps. And kill these rats. I must expose the lie</segment3>
		<segment4>You didnt make these rats appear. When you dont see them, theyre all still here. This is not you, this is not you. This is how I hide my sin from my fear</segment4>
		<segment5>The truth wont hide. What sort of man am I?. To set these traps. And kill these rats. I must expose the lie</segment5>
		<segment6>This ones inside. This ones inside. You can see its beady eyes. This ones inside. This ones inside</segment6>
		<segment7>I cant clean my charcoal soul. What I need is the hand of an exterminator</segment7>
		<segment8>The truth wont hide. What sort of man am I?. To set these traps. And kill these rats. I must expose the lie    </segment8>
