		<segment1>So you think that I could ride. This wave all the way through. So you think that I could just stand here. With nothing to hold on to. I can feel it, it's breaking, it's coming down. It's crashing down from up high. I can't see it, it's too big too fast. I've already shut eyes </segment1>
		<segment2>The endings are all right?. The endings are all good? </segment2>
		<segment3>What if I could reach inside. To take a deeper breath to see it's all right. What if I saw you at my side </segment3>
		<segment4>I know I was made to go up this mountain. Every bone in my body tells me it's right. I know I was made to go up this mountain. But I'm getting scared of heights. Still I'll sleep to the sound of the monsters roar. Cause I'll sleep next to your heartbeat forever </segment4>
		<segment5>The endings are all right. The endings are all good </segment5>
		<segment6>What if I could reach inside. To take a deeper breath to see it's all right. What if I saw you at my side    </segment6>
