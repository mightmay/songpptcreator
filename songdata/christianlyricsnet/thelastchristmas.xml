		<segment1>I feel your heart beating. Inside my own skin. And I think I'll marry. In Bethlehem. . That night in a stable. Our saviour was born. Yes we have so much. To be thankful for. . On the last Christmas. The last Christmas. The last Christmas. Without you. . They're choosing the colours. Preparing your room. For one day; Midsummer. The advent of you. . Together we wait for. A heavenly gift. Is winter a wonder?. Enchanted that this is. . The last Christmas. The last Christmas. The last Christmas. Without you. . See the stars shining for above. Hear the singing. Praise to the Giver of Life and Love. Maker of Beautiful things.. . I feel you heart beating. Inside my own skin. And I think I'll marry. In Bethlehem. . When darkness was shattered. The dawn of God's grace. And the journey'd begun. To the first Easter day. . On the this Christmas. The last Christmas. The last Christmas. The very last Christmas. The last Christmas (x 3). Without you    </segment1>
