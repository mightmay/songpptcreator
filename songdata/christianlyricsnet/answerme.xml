		<segment1>Ordinary, think of all I could have been. What were You thinking?. Temporary, what a fragile state for You to find me in</segment1>
		<segment2>And if I lose myself in You. Will I find my hope renewed?</segment2>
		<segment3>Someday, when I look into Your eyes. I will be caught up in Your majesty. And someday, for the first time in my life. I won't speak, and You won't have to answer me</segment3>
		<segment4>Listen closely to the beating of my heart. Betrays my feelings. Sinking slowly, so afraid that I will never see that far</segment4>
		<segment5>And if I give You all I can. Will You take as I am?</segment5>
		<segment6>This is a part of my redemption story. Can't see much further down the road before me. But I will listen to experience. As it sings a song of your faithfulness    </segment6>
