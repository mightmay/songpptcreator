		<segment1>It's Friday night. You want to hang out with your friend's cause you've had it up to here. School just started and you wonder to yourself, Where did my summer go?. But it will be all right tonight because..It's Friday night. Let's go. Let's all have some fun tonight. All right. Here we go. Here we go tonight. It's Monday again and it feels like it never ends. Where did your life go?. Did you forget what it was like?. This week is way too slow, it'll never end. When will it go?. You've made it through the week, and now you feel just fine. There'll be no nervous breakdown tonight becauseIt's Friday night. Let's go. Let's all have some fun tonight. All right. Here we go. Here we go tonight. It doesn't matter where we go or what we do. Let's just do it now. Go to the Gas N Sip, and hang out there all night. It'll be all right.    </segment1>
