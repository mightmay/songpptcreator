Intricate are you among the masses . Interested in you will never pass us . Woke up today in a praising state on mind . Had a revelation while I'm waitin in line . A picture of your face flashed across the screen . It's time to come together to sing 217 . Stare at me I can't forget a set of eyes . The window to your soul is what I'd like to analyze . So don't be surprised when I memorize you in a crowd . We the people got a purpose and it's now . Stare at me . Stare at me tonight . Intricate are you among the masses . Intricate are you will never pass us . So give me just a second to catch my breath . Heart attacks will come but I'll never see death . No need for verbs of descripition dig . Depiction tonight eternal listen kid . So inspire this poet from cage to stage . I'll climb to the window pencil to the page . Inside connection inside reflection . Me to you mine is yours musical affection . Open your window . You're a star . Interested in you . Intricate in you
