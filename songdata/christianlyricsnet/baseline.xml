		<segment1>You got me dreamin' in color. I refuse to think any other way. Gotta get it straight. Before it gets too late. Bring back. Bring back the baseline. I think it's about that time. I cant afford to miss. I was made for this. And I can't wait for a change of pace, hey. If It's gonna be, It's gotta be sometime. Be sometime tonight. You break in. We break out. Let's break out. I know things have been changing. I guess worry's been invading me. I'm getting tired of being uninspired. So bring back, bring back the good times. I think that would be just fine. It's where I belong. So I'll just sing on. And I can't wait for this thing to break. If it's gonna be, It's gotta be sometime. Be sometime tonight. If it's gonna be, It's gotta be sometime. Be sometime tonight. bring back, bring back the baseline.    </segment1>
