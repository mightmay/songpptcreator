		<segment1>Did I change your mind with. What I said last night?. Did I break your heart by. Straying so far?. From what you have in mind. For my life?</segment1>
		<segment2>Would you change me from. Who I've been lately?. 'Cause I know I'm nothing. Without you</segment2>
		<segment3>Did my words betray the. Patience I once claimed. Can't you see it in my face?. I need your grace</segment3>
		<segment4>Would you change me from. Who I've been laterly?. 'Cause I lnow I'm nothing. Without you. Would you save me from. The way I've been lately?. 'Cause I can't see living. Without you</segment4>
		<segment5>Would you change me from. Who I've been lately?. 'Cause I lnow I'm nothing. without you. Would you break me from. The way I've been lately?. 'Cause I can't see living. Without you    </segment5>
