		<segment1>a mouthful of yesterday. is all thats now left to say. and im ever anxious to spit. or choke on it either way. on one hand its off of my chest. the other will put it to rest. and so out of my misery. tell me which do you think is the best?. and right now I've got to. do something before it. gets any worse. you know we can't ignore it. I know just what you would say. it just works out good this way. so true to form you deny. the past that you're trying to hide. and cover with careful regard. the feelings your bravado belied. so shed yourself a new skin. yeah, one that's thicker again. put back on your moth-eaten mask. you know the one with the permanent grin.    </segment1>
