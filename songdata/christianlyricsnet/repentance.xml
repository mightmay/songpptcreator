		<segment1>Rape the world of morality, desecrate our land. Obliterate a society. It's gotten out of hand. Sodomy a way of life, flaunted on TV. Learning nothing from our past. A blind eye just can't see. Prime time stars are criminals, gaining the spot light. Murderous philosophy. Innocent victimized. Lyrics fueled by all that's vile, sewing seeds of hate. Denying responsibility, our world has gone insane. HEY!. Repentance, forgiveness for the land. Repentance, His coming is at hand. Repentance, forgiveness in our land. Repentance, His judgment we will stand. Rape the world of morality, desecrate our land. Obliterate a society. It's gotten out of hand. In God we trust, our nation's creed. Repentance essential here. Seeds we sow will reap a harvest. The time is getting near. Repentance, forgiveness for the land. Repentance, His coming is at hand. Repentance, forgiveness in our land. Repentance, His judgment we will stand    </segment1>
