		<segment1>When we start to fight and you play your stupid games, the frustration sets in and I just can't think straight. I know that tomorrow will bring a new day. We'll be friends 'till the end, but it won't last that long. What is there to fear, when tomorrow brings a new day?. Don't let the sun go down on your anger. When morning brings the sun, I feel better than before. Though last night went all wrong, I can't dwell upon that. If we can't work it out then I will take the blame. We'll be right where we were, another fight's all the same.     </segment1>
