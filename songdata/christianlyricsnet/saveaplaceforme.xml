		<segment1>Don't be mad if I cry. It just hurts so bad sometimes. 'Cause everyday it's sinking in. And I have to say goodbye all over again. You know I bet it feels good to have the weight of this world off your shoulders now. I'm dreaming of the day when I'm finally there with you</segment1>
		<segment2>Save a place for me. Save a place for me. I'll be there soon. I'll be there soon. Save a place for me. Save some grace for me. I'll be there soon. I'll be there soon</segment2>
		<segment3>I have asked the question why. But I guess the answer's for another time. So instead I'll pray with every tear. And be thankful for the time I had you here. And I wanna live my life just like you did. Make the most of my time just like you did. And I wanna make my home up in the sky. Just like you did. Oh, but until I get there. Until I get there    </segment3>
