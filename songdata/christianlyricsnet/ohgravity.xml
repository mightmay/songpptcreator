		<segment1>There's a fracture in the color bar. In the backseat of a parked car. By the liquor store where the streetlight. Keep you company 'til the next night </segment1>
		<segment2>In the same town, there's the same scar. In the same glow of the liquor store. By the freeway, where the headlight. Keep her company 'til the next night </segment2>
		<segment3>- Chorus - </segment3>
		<segment4>Oh! Gravity. Why can't we seem to keep it together?. Sons of my enemies, Why can't we seem to keep it together? </segment4>
		<segment5>In the back room of the Pentagon. There's a thin man with a line drawn. With a red jaw and a red bite. Watch the headline on the next night. Why this tragedy?. Why can't we seem to keep it together? </segment5>
		<segment6>In the fallout, the fallout. We found out the hype won't get you through. We're connected, connected. I meant it, the hype won't get you through    </segment6>
