		<segment1>Is there an earthquake causing the earth to shake. So violently that I can't stand on my two feet. (Why can't I stand on my two feet?). It makes my heart break knowing I'm not. What I thought I'd be. I always hoped for greater things. (I know I'm meant for greater things). But not now</segment1>
		<segment2>Tear down these walls. I'd climb but I can't stand to fall without You. Tear down these walls that separate us now. I can't make them fall without You</segment2>
		<segment3>I spent a long time building barricades to fortify. Creating space by drawing lines (by drawing lines). But now I realize when I try to hide it's all in vain. I end up pushing You away. (I'm tired of pushing You away). But not now</segment3>
		<segment4>You'll find me lying down in the debris waiting for You. There's not much left of me. But what is left is willing. God I'm willing    </segment4>
