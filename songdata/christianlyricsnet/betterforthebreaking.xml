		<segment1>This is me - This is me broken. This is me - Facing defeat. This is me - Choking on my words. Trying to tell you how I feel. This is me - Going through the motions. Wonder if you know I'm not really here. This is me -. Wish I could take you where I'm going. Gotta do this on my own and face my fear</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll be better for - Better for the breaking. Finally I have the chance to be awakened. No I'm not afraid. It's the choice that I made to start again. And I'll be better for. Better for the breakin'</segment2>
		<segment3>This is me- This is me broken. Finally I can let it out. This is me - Finally facing all of the pain. All of the doubt</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll be better for - Better for the breaking. Finally I have the chance to be awakened. No I'm not afraid. It's the choice that I made to start again. And I'll be better for. Better for the breakin'</segment4>
		<segment5>Unseen hands are working. Until they are bleeding and I'm breaking. So break me and break me and break me again. I'll be better for it</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll be better for - Better for the breaking. Finally I have the chance to be awakened. No I'm not afraid. It's the choice that I made to start again. And I'll be better for. Better for the breakin'</segment6>
		<segment7>This is me - This is me broken    </segment7>
