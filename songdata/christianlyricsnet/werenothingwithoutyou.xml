		<segment1>You took away all my anger. We put away all your pride. Now you're gone, It's plain to see we're nothing. Now you're as the solitude of space is. We took it all away from you. You'd like to think you made us. We took it all away, away. You let us know that we are nothing. You took away all our pleasure. We took away all your pain. Now we're gone it's plain to see you're nothing. Now you're as the solitude of space is. We're nothing without you. What you want is what you get. </segment1>
