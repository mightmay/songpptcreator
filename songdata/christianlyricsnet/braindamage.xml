		<segment1>Blind they pull us to the cliffs. Watch yourself they're just sent to kill. Are we afraid of falling short. It's misdirection I've seen. </segment1>
		<segment2>We are the sons and daughters of broken homes. Kings of great peace couldn't compare to us. Because we are the light wherever darkness breeds. And we will never bow to them. </segment2>
		<segment3>Torn they trick the best of us. A preacher smile behind a pulpit of blame. (oh oh). Are you a slave to brain damage. Let's fight the motions and feed. </segment3>
		<segment4>We are the sons and daughters of broken homes. Kings of great peace couldn't compare to us. Because we are the light wherever darkness breeds. And we will never bow to them. </segment4>
		<segment5>We are the sons and daughters of broken homes. Kings of great peace couldn't compare to us. Because we are the light wherever darkness breeds. And we will never bow to them.    </segment5>
