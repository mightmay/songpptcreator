		<segment2>. My days are getting better. Since I read your letter. Every day. Things are so much clearer. Since I let you You nearer. Every Day</segment2>
		<segment3>I just can't wait to breathe this air. Inside me, Inside me. I just can't wait to see You there. Beside me, Beside me</segment3>
		<segment4>I got a super good feeling about today. I got a clue that it's You. And You're never gonna go away</segment4>
		<segment5>My world is spinning towards You. I fall down before you. Every Day. I close my eyes together. Jesus, You forever. Every Day. I just can't wait to see You there. Beside me, Beside me.     </segment5>
