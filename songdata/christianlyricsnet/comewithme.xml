		<segment1>vs1. sirens sing sweetly songs so soft saying. come with me. innocent listen, green shore sweet beckons. come with me</segment1>
		<segment2>glory and wisdom, your foes at your feet. while you are resting in peace</segment2>
		<segment3>ch. my hands are bound and my heart is tied. enslave me, youll save me. come with me</segment3>
		<segment4>vs2. taste these lips dripping with honey sweet, listen. come with me. sweet coupled airs singing and secrets safe keeping. come with me</segment4>
		<segment5>take your relief from these stones and this fame. your fall will be broken with faith</segment5>
		<segment6>ch. my hands are bound and my heart is tied. enslave me, youll save me. come with me    </segment6>
