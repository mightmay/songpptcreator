		<segment1>I am so weak and I'm so tired. It's hard for me to. Find enough strength to feed the fires. That fuel my ego. And consequently all my pride has all but died. Which leaves me. Down on my knees. Back to the place I. Should have started from</segment1>
		<segment2>Been beat up. Been broken down. Nowhere but up. When you're facedown. On the ground. I'm in last place. If I place at all. But there's hope for this underdog !. That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!. That's the way, uh-huh, we like it!. You can call me the underdog</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm in this race to win a prize. The odds against me. The world has plans for my demise. What they don't see. Is that a winner is not judged by his small size. But by the substitute he picks to run the race. And mine's already won.     </segment3>
