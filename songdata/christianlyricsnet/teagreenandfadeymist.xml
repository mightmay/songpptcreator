		<segment1>She comes walking, with a slow and easy step. She gets into my mind, so sweet and innocent. Glancing over, to see if you're with me. Slow breathes taken, leavce no one alone.</segment1>
		<segment2>I will not, forget these days. I will not, forget this time.</segment2>
		<segment3>The first day that I met you. I was looking in the sky, The sun turned all a blur. And the thunder clouds rolled by, You looked so cool and casual, so I try and look the same, But now I've got to love you, tell. Me who am I to blame.    </segment3>
