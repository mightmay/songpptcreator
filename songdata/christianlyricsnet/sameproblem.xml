		<segment1>Oh no the battle forms inside, And I speak, but you don't see the signs, My heart aches, leaving me here to hide, My world shakes, until you assure me,</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh no there goes composure, Over and out to sea, oh no this won't control me, But it seems to get the best of me,</segment2>
		<segment3>The same problem, coming to haunt me again, And I know it's taken the best of my head, The same problem tears me to pieces inside, And I'm left to wonder why..</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh no I'm crossing my fingers, In hopes that you will not leave me, Far away, the silence it burns me, As I wait, the tension builds,</segment4>
		<segment5>The same problem, coming to haunt me again, And I know it's taken the best of my head, The same problem tears me to pieces inside, And I'm left to wonder why..</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh why can't I move forward?. Oh why does my mind wander?. Oh why does my heart desire you?</segment6>
		<segment7>The same problem, coming to haunt me again, And I know it's taken the best of my head, The same problem tears me to pieces inside, And I'm left to wonder..</segment7>
		<segment8>The same problem, coming to haunt me again, And I know it's taken the best of my head, The same problem tears me to pieces inside, And I'm left to wonder oh why..</segment8>
		<segment9>Oh no there goes composure..</segment9>
		<segment10>    </segment10>
