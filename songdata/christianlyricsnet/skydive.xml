		<segment1>Theres a man on the roof. Ignoring the fireworks. The city walks by unmoved. Their laughter looks like tears</segment1>
		<segment2>On top of a skyscraper. With a foundation of fears. Hopes deferred and dreams (Proverbs 13:12). He thinks cant come true</segment2>
		<segment3>The city keeps hurting him. He crawls to it for medicine. All the answers are here. Hes asking the wrong questions</segment3>
		<segment4>On top of a skyscraper. With a foundation of fears. Empty works and dreams. He thinks cant come true. For what can he do?. What has he to offer to You?</segment4>
		<segment5>Your Majesty, hes jumping. Hes jumping</segment5>
		<segment6>Hes falling. Into Your arms.     </segment6>
