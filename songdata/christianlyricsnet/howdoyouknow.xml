		<segment1>I've got my doubts, and I've got my questions. It's nothing new, cause I've seen them before. I've had my share of false revelations. It always seems they're knockin' on my door</segment1>
		<segment2>You said that I should see the light. But sometimes, faith is blind</segment2>
		<segment3>How do you know, how do you know. What I'm supposed to be doing?. Why do you go, why do you go on. Thinking you know my fate?. So many times, I've lost my step but never lost my way. How do you know, how do you know. When I don't know myself?</segment3>
		<segment4>You're thinking that you've got all the answers. You've got my situation figured out. But you're only seeing part of the picture. There's so much more that you don't know about</segment4>
		<segment5>And here, you come to speak your mind. But I'll say one more time.     </segment5>
