		<segment1>Through forgotten convictions. Misplaced affections. I'm losing the sound of Your voice. I've been chasing after emptiness. Trying to tidy up this mess. I swear I've been down this road before. I want to get back to where it all began. When I would long for only You </segment1>
		<segment2>Like a child I'll take You at Your word. As these mountains of doubt, they fade away. I'm longing to trust and love You more. So for me this is beautiful. A brand new thought, and a brand new world. Can I stay here forever here with You? </segment2>
		<segment3>I've lost sight of what first drew me. To the love that pursued me. The joy that inspired my song. The friendship that was all I knew. The arms that I would fall into. Seem miles and years from where I am today. I got to get back to where it all began. When I would wait for only You </segment3>
		<segment4>Can I stay here forever. Here with you?. Surrounded by Your mercy. Clothed in Your truth. Always, I'll stay. Always here with You </segment4>
		<segment5>Can I be here forever. Here with You?. Can I know what it's like. To deeply love You?. Always, Lord, let me stay. Always, here with You    </segment5>
