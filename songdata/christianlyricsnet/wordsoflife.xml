		<segment1>One this hallowed ground. In this holy moment. Lord I am amazed standing in Your presence. Let me heart be still. And everything surrounding. Listen to the voice that was all creations founding</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Words of Life. (Speak to me). Words of Life. (Jesus speak). Words of life to me</segment2>
		<segment3>Down here on my knees. I'm broken and I'm bleeding. Longing to be free. So desperately I'm needing. You to look my way. And see this poor heart beating. You have but to say. One word will be my healing. Lord Speak</segment3>
		<segment4>Speak Your words of life to me. Say the words that set me free. I long to hear You, long to feel. You're drawing near, I'm drawing near to You    </segment4>
