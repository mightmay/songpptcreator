		<segment1>Can't change this feeling. i'm way out of touch. can't change this meaning. it means too much. never been this lonely. never felt so good. can't be the only one misunderstood. I remind myself of somebody else. feeling like I'm chasing. like i'm facing myself alone. I've got somebody elses thoughts in my head. I want some of my own. I want some of my own. i want some of my own. can you see me up here. would you bring me back down. cause I've been living to see my fears as they fall to the ground. I remind myself of somebody else. feeling like I'm chasing. like I'm facing myself alone. I've got somebody elses thoughts in my head. I want some of my own. I want some of my own. i want some of my own. am I hiding behind my doubts. are they hiding behind me. closer to finding out. it doesn't mean anything. I remind myself of somebody else now    </segment1>
