		<segment1>I don't know how to explain it. But I know that words will hardly do. Miracles with signs and wonders. Aren't enough for me to prove to you</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't you know I've always loved you. Even before there was time. Though you turn away. I'll tell you still. Don't you know I've always loved you. And I always will</segment2>
		<segment3>Greater love has not a man. Than the one who gives his life to prove. That he would do anything. And that's what I'm going to do for you    </segment3>
