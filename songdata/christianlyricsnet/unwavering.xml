		<segment1>Blessed are the poor. The kingdom is theirs. Alive in the promise. To be dead to the world. Blessed are the meek. In honor of your Father. The Word at your right hand. The Spirit of truth</segment1>
		<segment2>Unwavering is your voice. Unwavering is your hand. Unwavering is the heart that bled for the sins of men. Unwavering is your will. Unwavering is your plan. The fount of salvation on which we will stand</segment2>
		<segment3>Blessed are the righteous. On bended knee. Found in this freedom. Committed to you. Blessed are those who see. The heights of glory. Found in the valley. And suffering for you</segment3>
		<segment4>Unwavering is your voice. Unwavering is your hand. Unwavering is the heart that bled for the sins of men. Unwavering is your will. Unwavering is your plan. The fount of salvation on which we will stand</segment4>
		<segment5>Send us out to be your hands and feet. Send us out to be your hands and feet. Send us out to be your hands and feet</segment5>
		<segment6>Unwavering is your voice. Unwavering is your hand. Unwavering is the heart that bled for the sins of men. Unwavering is your will. Unwavering is your plan. The font of salvation on which we will stand</segment6>
		<segment7>The font of salvation on which we will stand</segment7>
		<segment8>Send us out to be your hands and feet. Send us out to be your hands and feet. Send us out to be your hands and feet. Send us out to be your hands and feet. Send us out to be your hands and feet. Send us out to be your hands and feet    </segment8>
