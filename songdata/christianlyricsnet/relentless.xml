		<segment1>Wisdom called but fell on deaf ears. Fallen asleep in the garden as the wolves appeared. You work your plan crafted with skill. Scaled their eyes they can't see you kill </segment1>
		<segment2>Promising fulfillment. Bringing emptiness and pain. Knocked unconscious the loss is your gain. Feeling the result falling so fast. Has it tasted bad enough, will this season last? </segment2>
		<segment3>MERCY. None in you. The KILLING. You see it through. STRIKING. I'm out of breath. SURELY. Seeking only my death.     </segment3>
