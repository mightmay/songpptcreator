		<segment1>If I'm a bad person, you don't like me. Well, I guess I'll make my own way. It's a circle, a mean cycle. I can't excite you anymore</segment1>
		<segment2>Where's your gavel? Your jury?. What's my offense this time?. You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me. Well, sentence me to another life</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't wanna hear your sad songs. I don't wanna feel your pain. When you swear it's all my fault. 'Cause you know we're not the same. No, we're not the same, oh, we're not the same</segment3>
		<segment4>We're the friends who stuck together. We wrote our names in blood. But I guess you can't accept that the change is good. It's good, it's good</segment4>
		<segment5>Well, you treat me just like another stranger. Well, it's nice to meet you, sir. I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out</segment5>
		<segment6>You treat me just like another stranger. Well, it's nice to meet you, sir. I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out</segment6>
		<segment7>Ignorance is your new best friend. Ignorance is your new best friend</segment7>
		<segment8>This is the best thing that could've happened. Any longer and I wouldn't have made it. It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture. I'm just a person but you can't take it</segment8>
		<segment9>The same tricks that, that once fooled me. They won't get you anywhere. I'm not the same kid from your memory. Well, now I can fend for myself</segment9>
		<segment10>Don't wanna hear your sad songs. I don't wanna feel your pain. When you swear it's all my fault. 'Cause you know we're not the same. No, we're not the same, oh, we're not the same</segment10>
		<segment11>Yeah, we used to stick together. We wrote our names in blood. But I guess you can't accept that the change is good. It's good, it's good</segment11>
		<segment12>Well, you treat me just like another stranger. Well, it's nice to meet you, sir. Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out</segment12>
		<segment13>You treat me just like another stranger. Well, it's nice to meet you, sir. Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out</segment13>
		<segment14>Ignorance is your new best friend. Ignorance is your new best friend. Ignorance is your new best friend. Ignorance is your new best friend</segment14>
		<segment15>Well, you treat me just like another stranger. Well, it's nice to meet you, sir. Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out</segment15>
		<segment16>You treat me just like another stranger. Well, it's nice to meet you, sir. I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out.     </segment16>
