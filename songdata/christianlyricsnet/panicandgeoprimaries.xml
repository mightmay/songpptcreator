		<segment1>Threatening, it's a window open. Slide through like an aero plainn in the dark. And this is creeping, moving in control. Lasting to the twisted tune that led to. All the shaking in the dark. And boards that lift to find mechanic souls. To know you are tangled. In the coral colored Queen's dress. As her figure leaves the ground. And this is creeping, moving on it's own. Shot out to the newest planet. Turned on the Discoveratory's light. And this is everyone who watched, displayed. Breathing in the dark, there finding where you are. In and out of sleep. I'm on the floor. I'm spinning circles, bloody circles. Can you see that everything has changed again?. Now what have I heard them speak as the evening candle flickered?    </segment1>
