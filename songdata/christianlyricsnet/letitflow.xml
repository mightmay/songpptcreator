		<segment1>We have come to bring our praise to the one who changes hearts. We are moved by your love as you give yourself to us. And we pledge to give ourselves that the world will know your grace. This grace that captures me</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). I wanna see your spirit movin' through the streets. Touching everyone to bring us to our knees. So won't you pour out from the rivers of my soul. And let it flow, let it flow, let it flow</segment2>
		<segment3>We have come to bring our praise to the one who changes hearts. We are moved by your love as you give yourself to us. And we pledge to give ourselves that the world will know your grace. This grace that covers me</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>We need you. We yearn for you. We cry to you. We need you. (Repeat).     </segment5>
