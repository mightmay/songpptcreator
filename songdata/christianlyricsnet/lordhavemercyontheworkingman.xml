		<segment1>All around I hear the sound of money. But I ain't got a nickel to my name. And everywhere I look I see temptation. She stands on every corner and calls my name </segment1>
		<segment2>Won't you tell me if you can. Cause life's so hard to understand. Why's the rich man busy dancing. While the poor man pays the band. Oh they're billing me for killing me. Lord have mercy on the working man </segment2>
		<segment3>Uncle Sam's got his hands in my pockets. And he helps himself each time he needs a dime. Them politicians treat me like a mushroom. Cause they feed me bull and keep me in the blind </segment3>
		<segment4>Won't you tell me if you can. Cause life's so hard to understand. Why's the rich man busy dancing. While the poor man pays the band. Oh they're billing me for killing me. Lord have mercy on the working man </segment4>
		<segment5>Hey, St. Peter look down for a minute. And see this little man about to drown. There's quicksand all around and man I'm in it. Please help me up Lord cause I'm going down </segment5>
		<segment6>Won't you tell me if you can. Cause life's so hard to understand. Why's the rich man busy dancing. While the poor man pays the band. Oh they're billing me for killing me. Lord have mercy on the working man </segment6>
		<segment7>Won't you tell me if you can. Cause life's so hard to understand. Why's the fat man busy dancing. While the thin man pays the band. Oh they're billing me for killing me. Lord have mercy on the working man </segment7>
		<segment8>Please, Lord have mercy on the working man. Please, Lord have mercy on the working man    </segment8>
