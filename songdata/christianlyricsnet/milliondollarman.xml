		<segment1>He's driving down a road to nowhere. The moon reflects off his spotless car. Speeding away from all he's known. To greener grass on the other side </segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]. He's a million dollar man. He's got everything he wanted. But now what he wants is what he had. But he threw it all away. For a life filled with cars and rings and everything that money can bring </segment2>
		<segment3>Now everything is not what he thought. As guilt reaches in for all of his wrong. The profit is worthless when you're alone. The grass isn't greener on this lonely side </segment3>
		<segment4>He threw it all away.     </segment4>
