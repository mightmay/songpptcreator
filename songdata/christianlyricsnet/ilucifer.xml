		<segment1>I carved a picture, into my skin. I showed everyone, I'll never sin. Just cause I bleed like you, I'm not a man. Not of this world, and you must understand that.</segment1>
		<segment2>I've got a predestined plan. I walk better than you. I'll preach what I practice, and I will practice on you.</segment2>
		<segment3>I carved your holy name, inside my skin. I showed everyone, I'm not a trend. I am a zombie, I'd be better off dead. I speak of angels, but host demons instead.</segment3>
		<segment4>I pray for a prayer that's you. I am praying on you. And I talk about walking, and I try to walk upon you.</segment4>
		<segment5>When I look at all of you I see, I see the weak, I'm a wolf among the lost sheep. When I look at all of you I see, I see the weak, I'm a wolf among the lost sheep.</segment5>
		<segment6>I will tell them the scriptures. I will profit your name. I will sell them the scriptures, and I will pocket your fame.</segment6>
		<segment7>I magnify splinters. The world is carved from my eyes. I am posing for pictures. I am feasting on bread and your wine    </segment7>
