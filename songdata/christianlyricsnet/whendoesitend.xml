		<segment1>Taking my time, I thought I had learned how to deal with all the changes in my life. Things were going the way I had planned, one more thing was thrown at me. When does this heartache and pain ever end?. As long as I'm not by myself I know I'll be o.k. It seems like every time things were going o.k., life throws me a curve. I stop for a second and ask myself, am I ever gonna make it through?    </segment1>
