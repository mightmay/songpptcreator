Should I start this song off with a question?. Or should I say what's on my mind.. (Add a cello here to add a sad impression).. Cause I'm not looking forward to leaving my friends all behind.. I didn't vote (though I'm not proud), cause I'm Canadian, and I'm not allowed.. Give it a go or throw in the towel.. Stand all alone or swim through the crowd.. No one around to help you decide.. It's time to make up your mind.. It's time to make up your mind.. By the wayside we fell.. He said, &quot;It's my way or the highway to hell.&quot;. It's your decision, choose it well.. He said, &quot;It's my way or the highway to hell.&quot;. Decisions we make; life's an election.. Precision we take, seeking direction.. But there's so many lies.. Unsure where we can look.. But we've got a guide- a really thick handbook.. No one around to help you decide.. It's time to make up your mind.. It's time to make up your mind.. Are you with me or against me?. Noticed you're sitting on the fence.. We wondered why you're not cut and dry.. You got to choose our side and live, or their side and die.. Which hand holds your soul?. Do you want to guess one?. If it scares you to death, may that be your lesson.. It's your decision, make it the best one.. And should I end this song off with a question?.
