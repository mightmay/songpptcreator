		<segment1>I'll try to shed some common sense, situation so intense. Many questions, don't know whys &amp; all the lies got tempers risin'. There's 2 or 3 sides to it all, but just one truth if I recall. Looking to &amp; thinking through, the word of God infinite, true. If you want honest answers, I know you do, so say it's true. We all want honest answers, something true, it's nothing new </segment1>
		<segment2>You're threatened by what you don't understand, and it's time. Give up yourself, why won't you stop facading? This wicked world </segment2>
		<segment3>So set in the ways, you've been taought day after day. This nations brainwashed, without a clue, still they know not what they do. I can't cast the stone, cause iv'e got problems of my own. But I'm discussing, being real, this just the way I feel.     </segment3>
