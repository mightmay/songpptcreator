		<segment1>You put me here for a reason. You have a mission for me. You knew my name and You called it. Long before I learned to breathe</segment1>
		<segment2>Sometimes I feel disappointed. By the way I spend my time. How can I further Your kingdom. When I'm so wrapped up in mine</segment2>
		<segment3>In a Blink of an eye that is when. I'll be closer to You than I've ever been. Time will fly, but until then. I'll embrace every moment I'm given. There's a reason I'm alive for a blink of an eye</segment3>
		<segment4>And though I'm living a good life. Can my life be something great?. I have to answer the question. Before it's too late</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause in a Blink of an eye that is when. I'll be closer to You than I've ever been. Time will fly, but until then. I'll embrace every moment I'm given. There's a reason I'm alive for a blink of an eye</segment5>
		<segment6>If I give the very best of me. That becomes my legacy. So tell me what am I waiting for?. What am I waiting for?</segment6>
		<segment7>In a Blink of an eye that is when. I'll be closer to You than I've ever been. Time will fly, but until then. I'll embrace every moment I'm given</segment7>
		<segment8>In a Blink of an eye that is when. I'll be closer to You than I've ever been. Time will fly, but until then. I'll embrace every moment I'm given. There's a reason I'm alive for a blink of an eye    </segment8>
