		<segment1>Missing you like crazy. I feel a million miles away. A part of me is empty. That noone could replace. So i'll run to you. Despite the shame. I'll leave it all behind </segment1>
		<segment2>On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you. On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you </segment2>
		<segment3>How could you ever love me. When I didn't love myself. When my broken (ness?) consumed me. Everyone just walked away. You took me by the hand. I'm nothing without you </segment3>
		<segment4>On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you. On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you </segment4>
		<segment5>And all those years. Without you here. ?? with so much pain. And on my own. I tried to change. I'm simply lost without you </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm tearing down the walls. The walls that kept me in for so long. I'm tearing down the walls </segment6>
		<segment7>On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you. On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you </segment7>
		<segment8>On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you. On my way home. On my way home. I'm running back to you.     </segment8>
