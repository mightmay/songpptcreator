		<segment1>I begin the day with the faith you fashion my ways, and I cannot escape for your hand it leads. Your right hand hold me. When I wake, you will be there. When the sun goes down in the night, you will be there. My life has been ordained. You have formed this very frame and I am fearfully made. For I was made in that secret place. How precious are your thoughts, all over me. They're more than the sands of the sea.</segment1>
