		<segment1>You've gone and done it again. Taken everything I have and multiplied by ten. Here I'm the lepper you washed clean. 1/9 of the citizens who never stopped to say a single thing. And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything. I count my blessings. but never turn to see their origin. Here I stand a blessed man. Back turned to my benefactor. and my only friend. How does it feel to be denied The friendship that you wanted so much. you would bow to me and even die. And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything. I count my blessings. but never turn to see their origin. Who Am I?. Who am I that you would bow and put your knees to dirty ground?. Who am I to meet the king and have him wash my soiled feet?. You met me here, whispered in my ear. Now I melt into you (x2). And this is how I treat the one who gave me everything. I count my blessings. but never turn to see their origin. Jesus, I feel you changing me</segment1>
		<segment2>This is a thank you. This is a thank you. This is a thank you. This is I'm sorry     </segment2>
