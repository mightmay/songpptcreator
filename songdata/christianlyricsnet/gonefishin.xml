		<segment1>I woke up today. strapped my shoes on tight. it's gonna be a long day. I won't be home till tonight. I'm going out to the lake. to see what I can bring in. if anybody needs me. tell them I've gone fishin'</segment1>
		<segment2>it seems like yesterday. was lost but now I'm found. I've got a great job that pays. to spread God's joy around. many have been led astray. I'll tell them what they've been missin'. Jesus is the only way. That's why I've gone fishin'</segment2>
