		<segment1>Where did you go?. Jesus, where did you go?. You flew into the clouds. We worship and we doubt. Now we're leaping for joy and singing</segment1>
		<segment2>So where are you now?. Tell me where are you now. Headed in the skies. Behind the poor man's eyes. Awaited and asserted. Until you take us home. Until you return</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. Your Spirit inside, burning bright. I'll leave a light on</segment3>
		<segment4>Here you are found. Jesus, here you are found. In the breaking of the bread. The waking of the dead. In our dying and our rising. Until you take us home. Until you return</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. Your Spirit inside, burning bright. I'll leave a light on</segment5>
		<segment6>Give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning 'till the break of day. Give me oil in my lamp. Keep it burning 'till the break of day</segment6>
		<segment7>Give me oil in my lamp. Give me oil in my lamp. Keep me burning 'till the break of day</segment7>
		<segment8>I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. Your Spirit inside, burning bright. I'll leave a light on</segment8>
		<segment9>I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. I'll leave a light on for you, my Lord. Your Spirit inside, burning bright. I'll leave a light on</segment9>
		<segment10>I'll leave a light on. (Shine on through the darkness). I'll leave a light on. (Shine on, shine on)    </segment10>
