		<segment1>Butchered to be left in parts. Disregard, labeled odd. Brain preserved in testing jars, then forgot. Typical condition. Tape the arms. Stitch the eyes shut. All for blood, all four walls, what to follow? </segment1>
		<segment2>A hatchet, to the corners of your heart </segment2>
		<segment3>Drawn toward the cutlery. Have to go, have to go. Carve your shame by incision, precision. Description, prescription. When to rest, when to unrest. Where to find different sorts. Other recourse? </segment3>
		<segment4>A hatchet, to the corners of your heart </segment4>
		<segment5>Have begun. To become. To be used. I've misspoken. Have no thoughts of my own. Mimic those. I have worshipped </segment5>
		<segment6>A hatchet, to the corners of your heart.     </segment6>
