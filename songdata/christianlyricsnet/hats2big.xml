		<segment1>Look at the line. You drawn yourself. So hard. To push past someone else. Why has. Your head grown so. Hat's to big don't you think so?</segment1>
		<segment2>Ego bigger than a stage. Why prove yourself to everyone. Be careful you might fall down</segment2>
		<segment3>Hey I think. They're looking now. Now your god. Maybe a clown. Proud like you raised it well. Ill mannered looks like hell</segment3>
		<segment4>Ego bigger than a stage. Why prove yourself to everyone. Be careful you might fall down</segment4>
		<segment5>Where are you, your lost inside. Hiding behind. The worlds lie.    </segment5>
