		<segment1>I had the whole world in my hands. And I gave it away</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm a half-wit boy. Cracking a smile and wearing it all on my sleeve. So cool and so poised. Its true I'm just around to see. Where this thing goes I'll never know. But all I know is packing bags is a remedy</segment2>
		<segment3>This time I'll be nervous. Cause I can't see your hands in front of me tonight. Lets forget all pretense of what they thought we should be. What liars we can be</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm on my way to the top of the world. And I've got a feeling I'll give it away</segment4>
		<segment5>She's a maverick she's so smooth. If things go according to plan. I'll have her finished by five a.m. There's no changing plans. There's no second chance. I've already got both feet through the door. And I can taste the air</segment5>
		<segment6>Make a sound it's safe for you. To choke in here alone</segment6>
		<segment7>Whatever I say goes. You're not here with me    </segment7>
