		<segment1>Edna, you got stuck running there, your hair on fire. Too long, careful not to falter or disappear. But made heaven, made like starlight, made of love </segment1>
		<segment2>Someone told you that your heart was gray. Since then I've been only thinking of you. When you're out of your amnesia day. You'll know how much I've been thinking of you. I've been thinking of you </segment2>
		<segment3>Edna, don't you wait until tomorrow to find your soul. Faint reminders still will follow everywhere you go. 'Cause you are not alone. But made like heaven, made like starlight, made of love </segment3>
		<segment4>Free your heart. Free your soul. See your light. Lose control     </segment4>
