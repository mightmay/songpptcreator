		<segment1>broken reality theres no means of escape. broken reality lookin' to leave this mind-state. but the more that i leave the harder it seems i come back. now im livin' out these lies that i call my trap. and i call it that cuz i didnt do this intentionaly. what i now call my trap i used to call my fantasy. and why do i fantasize in order to leave the reality. of not being able to relate personally or socially. somtimes i wonder what it would be like to be respected. but until then i'll dream about bein' accepted. i wonder what it would feel like to be respected</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: all wrong no right no one no sun no light. this life this fight i'll hide. inside no matter where you go you cant escape whats inside.</segment2>
		<segment3>man somebody get me out of this place. of loneliness hopelessness depression and disgrace. at this pace i'm on the verge of self-destruction. with nothin' to go on but my self instruction. so what does that leave me. i try to communicate with the world but none of you out. there could perceive me. so instead of words i began to express through actions. so anger n rage become my mere satisfaction. hate fills my being i'm seeing no means of release. so i escape into my fantasy where i live in peace. here i can be anybody i want to here i can be anybody i choose too. here in this place i feel good theres no restriction this place. is so good that its becoming my addiction</segment3>
		<segment4>i say im not lost but why am i searching. i say pain dont fade me but then again why am i hurtin. i say i wont show emotion but yet. i cant hide these eyes that have been stained by tears. i say i cant be help back but yet ive. been in the same place for years. i say i wanna go free but something keeps me bound. i say i wanna go higher but my feet havent left the ground. man i told ya'll i didnt care but then. again why is my heart so heavy. i told the world to bring it but deep down i knew i wasnt ready. i said i couldnt be deceived meanwhile im. walking into the same old traps. i said i couldnt be broke as i watch my world collapse. watch my world collapse</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: no matter where you go you cant escape whats inside. no matter where you go you cant escape whats inside. no matter where you go you cant escape whats inside. no matter where i go. (repeat 2x)    </segment5>
