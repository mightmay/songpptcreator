		<segment1>Here we are, in the best years of our lives. With no way of knowing. When the wheel stops spinning. 'Cause we don't know where we're going, and, </segment1>
		<segment2>Here we are, on the best day of our lives. And it's a go. Let's make it last. And cheers you all to that. 'Cause this moment's never coming back </segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. I used to know her brother. But I never knew I loved her. 'Till the day she laid her eyes on me. Now I'm jumping up and down. She's the only one around. And she means every little thing to me. I've got your picture in my wallet. And your phone number to call it. And I miss you more, whenever I think about you. I've got your mix tape in my Walkman. Been so long since we've been talking. And in a few more days, we'll both hook up forever, and ever </segment3>
		<segment4>And here I am, on the West Coast of America. And I've been trying to think for weeks of all the ways to ask you. Now I've brought you to the place. Where I poured my heart out a million times. For a million reasons. To offer it to you </segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS. I used to know her brother. But I never knew I loved her. 'Till the day she laid her eyes on me. Now I'm jumping up and down. She's the only one around. And she means every little thing to me. I've got your picture in my wallet. And your phone number to call it. And I miss you more, whenever I think about you. I've got your mix tape in my Walkman. Been so long since we've been talking. And in a few more days, we'll both hook up forever, and ever [2x].     </segment5>
