		<segment1>I humble myself before you. I lay myself down below you. In reverence I bow. Beneath you, my Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>I draw near to you forever. My Savior, my God, my Treasure. I stand here in awe. Indebted to you, my Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause I fear you, my God. And I fear you, my King. And I trust you with my soul. And I love you with all my heart. And I fear you with all my life</segment3>
		<segment4>I feel like a child around you. As I let all my praise surroud you. And I fall on my face. Astounded, my Lord</segment4>
		<segment5>You hold the oceans within your hand. You count the galaxies. You know the mysteries of this world. You see what no one sees</segment5>
		<segment6>Your hand can span the whole universe. You gave the stars their fame. You know my deepest of secrets, Lord. But still you have called me by name.     </segment6>
