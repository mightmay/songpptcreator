		<segment1>Could be she got lost. Or maybe, she just watched. A little too much TV. It's hard to say, but anyway, It's plain to see</segment1>
		<segment2>And so she goes on. Like a drifting satellite. But tonight</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Angels hold her hands. When she walks in the dark. Angels hold her hands. When she's falling apart</segment3>
		<segment4>God could keep His own half-acre. She'd move on. And make another way of her own. And now she feels. She's gained the wheel. But never control</segment4>
		<segment5>And so she fades out. Like a missing satellite. But tonight</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS. Angels hold her hands. When she walks in the dark. Angels hold her hands. When she's falling apart</segment6>
		<segment7>BRIDGE. And wherever she goes. Angels follow</segment7>
		<segment8>CHORUS. Angels hold her hands. When she walks in the dark. Angels hold her hands. When she's falling apart. Angels hold her hands. When she walks in the dark. Angels hold her hands. When shewalks away. When she's falling apart    </segment8>
