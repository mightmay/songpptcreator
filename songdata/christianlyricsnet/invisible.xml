		<segment1>[Verse 1]. A total eclipse has just begun. we blocked out the sun. can't believe this is what we've come to. so you think that your a star. but the real start has some scars. on his hands and feet where the nails went through. god is headlining this show. to introduce him is what i'm here for. so without further delay</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Its times to take to the stage. and i move out the way. So that they only see. you thats inside of me. don't let me block the view. thats not what i wanna do. I gotta be see through. make sure they see you. make me invisible</segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse 2]. The crowd appluads and now your on. they start to play your song. did he even come along. or did he get left behind. the day that you decided. you would out shine his light. but he's headlining this show. to introduce him is what i'm here for. so without further delay</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]. Its times to take to the stage. and i move out the way. So that they only see. you thats inside of me. don't let me block the view. thats not what i wanna do. I gotta be see through. make sure they see you. make me invisible    </segment4>
