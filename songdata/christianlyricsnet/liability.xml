		<segment1>You can tell us that it isn't serious. And you can tell us that you'll do it right. You can tell us that you've got it all worked out. You can tell us that it's all for us. But we know you're lying through your teeth. You can tell us that it's for security. And you can tell us it's for our own good. You can tell us that we wouldn't understand, and you can hide behind your practiced grin. But we know you're lying through your teeth. You will bare the brunt of liability. It will be a stone around your neck, drowning you in irresponsibility, underneath the weight of your regret. You can sell our secrets for your benefit. You can toss our bodies in the ground. You can ship our children off to battlefields. You can wipe the blood from both your hands. You can tell us that it's indisputable, as you throw away the evidence. But, we know you're lying through your teeth. You will bare the brunt of liability. It will be a stone around your neck, drowning you in irresponsibility, underneath the weight of your regret.     </segment1>
