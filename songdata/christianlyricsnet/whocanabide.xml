		<segment1>A mighty storm is rising (Jeremiah 25:32). A darkness in the land (Joel 2:2, Amos 5:18). But surely this must be a light. To those who understand. That all the prisoners of this Hope (Zechariah 9:12). Are about to be set free. As in one lightning moment. A familiar face at last they see</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Who can abide the Day of His Coming?. Who can withstand the final Call?. If you do not stand by faith, You will not stand at all (Isaiah 7:9). You will not stand at all</segment2>
		<segment3>The Valley of Decision. Begins to overflow (Joel 3:14). With some confused, bewildered. And some who seem to know. That this sad separation. Was their choice so they can tell. He simply speaks the sentence. That they have passed upon themselves</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Surely this must be our God. Behold the One we trusted in (Isaiah 25:9). He has come at last to save us. He has forgotten all our sin (Isaiah 43:25). (Chorus)    </segment5>
