		<segment1> cannot believe I'm this dirty. I'm ashamed to even ask to be clean. 'Cause I can't think of anyone less worthy. I have nothing to offer or to bring</segment1>
		<segment2>I throw myself on Your mercy. I throw myself at Your feet. I throw my filth on the grace. of One who's beauty is beyond me. And I wait. And I wait</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm not even sure how I got here. Wondered to this darkness from Your light. I still remember walking in the garden with You. Now I'm just stumbling through this night</segment3>
		<segment4>I throw myself on Your mercy. I throw myself at Your feet. I throw my filth on the grace. of One who's beauty is beyond me. And I wait. And I wait</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus: I wait for Your rain to fall. The waves of Your grace wash over me. I wait for Your rain to fall. Strange how forgiveness comes so easily. When I call Your name. And wait for Your rain</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord, this desert is killing me. My throat's dry from screaming Your name. I want to come home but the sands of time surround me. The dirt's finally covered my shame</segment6>
		<segment7>So I throw myself on Your mercy. I throw myself at Your feet. I throw my filth on the grace. of One who's beauty is beyond me. And I wait</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus    </segment9>
