		<segment1>If All The Worlds We Scattered And I Found My Way To Here. Then How Can I Love You The Way That I Love You?. Big Sky And A Silver Moon The Apple Of Your Eye. How Can I Explain It?. How Can I Maintain This? </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS </segment2>
		<segment3>My Tenderness Evolving. Your Faithfulness Revolving Around Me. Around Me. Angels In Their Glory. Regailing Of Your Story Around Me. Around Me. One Big Bang, An Atom I? O, How'd I Come To Be?. Whittled From A Bone Is Harder To Believe. Hope In Things I Cannot See. I Know That You Will Come. Seasons Quickly Turning. Quickly You're Returning </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS </segment4>
		<segment5>Treat Me With An Alibi So All My Friends May Wonder Why. I Have Immortal Favor. The King He Gives Me Favor </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS.     </segment6>
