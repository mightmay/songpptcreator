		<segment1>In the gold flood of light. Where the earth meets summer skies. In the satin chill of night. Where dreams await to rise. You bend, you kiss me. You pull me in. I can feel you. Running to me, running through me </segment1>
		<segment2>Hear the call of night. Open the borders of time. Hear the song of the stars. Sound like a whisper. I've fallen deep from the day. Into eternal, eternal visions of our love </segment2>
		<segment3>I am diamond, I am rust. From the place a love of love and pain. Made from heaven made from dust. Where dreams will live again     </segment3>
