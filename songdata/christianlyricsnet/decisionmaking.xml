		<segment1>It happens every single time, Just when I thought all is well. I'm either wrong or just not right, It seems I'm never good enough. (chorus). Look at me, I am trying hard as can be. To be the person that my sovereign maker wants me to be. Can't you see?. All I want's for his will to be done. Decision making's not my own. A selfish, one-way thinking mind. Can only make feelings of pain. An open heart goes hand in hand. With bringing problems to an end. (sing chorus)</segment1>
