		<segment1>My Back is so full of scrapes. With the miles I've walked of waste. Fade and fall away against. And numb my hunger to taste. What's the basis for change?. Excuses to feed my ego's rage?. I cling to my comfort to quench because. I'm content with my sadistic wretch. Find every reason not to kill the halfway beast. that steals my only peace. Don't expect it to rest Until its home is a naturalistic nest. But there is no coincidence But there is no compromise. Rise. Close my grip on the floodgates. and lean on the back of the covenant sealed in dreams. Anticipate the backlash. Uncountable grins fade to screams. Doubt's an ocean away on a sea that my last mistake drowned unwillingly. I don't have the trust to float inside the waves that seek to spill me. Rise. Unrealistic ideals Promises I can't keep I don't have those luxuries. I don't have the time you do to sleep. So now it starts And now it begins I've waited too long for this. For your fear to interfere again So now my vision's secured    </segment1>
