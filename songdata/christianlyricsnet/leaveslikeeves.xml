		<segment1>- verse 1 -. I dont love You though i aim to, though i claim to when i call Your Name. i dont believe You. I just deceive You and pretend sewn leaves like eves can hide my shameor like You are to blame.</segment1>
		<segment2>- chorus -. I would love to come before You and lay my crowns down on the ground at Your feet. But im afraid im a little too late. Because i pawned them off at the shop down the street. For a price that cant be beat.</segment2>
		<segment3>- verse 2 -. You dont amaze me. You dont even faze me. All my words are just hollow phrases. I must be crazy to think that maybe giving You all my love could leave me lazy. Or keep me complacent.</segment3>
		<segment4>- chorus -</segment4>
		<segment5>- bridge -. Im not broken and im not breaking. My eyes are open and i stand naked. Im not overwhelmed. Im not consumed. Im not all these things that i say to You. Cause i lie to You.</segment5>
		<segment6>- chorus -.     </segment6>
