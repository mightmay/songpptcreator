HEY CHRISTIAN!!! You're sleeping!. I will try to..(Your sleeping). Why can't I.. (Wake up). I will try to.. (Your sleeping). Why can't I.. (Wake up). Your will be done in my life.. Your will be done in my life.. Maranatha! Maranatha! Maranatha!. Our Lord comes! Our Lord comes! Our Lord comes!    </segment1>
