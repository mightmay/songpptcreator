		<segment1>Love saves the soul. Hate kills the heart. Fear robs the goal. Hope gives a start</segment1>
		<segment2>Forgiveness is a gift. Bitterness a chain. The ugliness we sift. His beauty still remains</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>When we all reach Heaven. There will be no shame. 'Cause when we stand before Him. He will know each name. Its all about believing. He died and took the pain. When we all reach Heaven. Its Mercy Over Blame</segment4>
		<segment5>(Verse 2)</segment5>
		<segment6>Faith heals the scars. That pride has brought upon. Grace will be ours. When all we have is gone</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>When we all reach Heaven. There will be no shame. 'Cause when we stand before Him. He will know each name. Its all about believing. He died and took the pain. When we all reach Heaven. Its Mercy Over Blame    </segment8>
