		<segment1>Distortion of my words. Help me know my flaws. Churning in the vault of bitterness and hurt. Twist what should be left alone in solitude. Still I picture you trying to repent.</segment1>
		<segment2>Feel the burn. Watch us burn.</segment2>
		<segment3>Time and time was spent finding out the truth. We believed in our undying youth. Nothing ever more modeled after you.</segment3>
		<segment4>Now everybody knows, And anyone can see, The way the story goes, And what you did to me. Tasted once before. Unlock sacred doors. Shut to our requests. Say you did your best. You said you were our friend. The lies were common place. What happened to forgiveness?. I'll never see your face again.      </segment4>
