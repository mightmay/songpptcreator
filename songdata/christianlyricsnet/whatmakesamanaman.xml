		<segment1>Take a look and see for yourself what makes a man. a man, and I will step back to the life I left. Maybe you won't forget who I am.</segment1>
		<segment2>Wake up in the middle of the night, Just don't believe everything's all right when these. thoughts are running around your head. And it's late, so you don't really want to say goodbye, so you just head down the stairs that lead you out. The sound of silence is as loud as a gunshot. &quot;Forgive me&quot; were the only words they read. on the note you left.</segment2>
		<segment3>Singing, oh.. can't find any way out.</segment3>
		<segment4>I wish I could live where the sea meets the land. The ocean and I would be the best of friends. I'd make her my own. I would float in her waves. She would sing me to sleep as she carries me away. Won't you carry me away?. Oh, please, carry me away. Ocean, carry me away. You're my better half.</segment4>
		<segment5>Singing, oh.. can't find any way out.</segment5>
		<segment6>(I don't really want to sing anymore. There's got to. be something I could live for, so just show me now. Everyday is just another regret. It's time for me to. give it a rest and it's over now.)    </segment6>
