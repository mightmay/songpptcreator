		<segment1>Over time youve healed so much in me. And I am living proof. That although my darkest hour had come. Your light could still shine through. And though at times its just enough to cast. A shadow on the wall. Well, I am grateful that you shined </segment1>
		<segment2>Through the growing and in knowing. All things work together for our good. And God works his purposes. Just like he said he would. Just like he said he would </segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus) </segment3>
		<segment4>I can't imagine Heaven's lullabies. And what they must sound like. But I will rest in knowing. Heaven is your home. And it's all you'll ever know. All you'll ever know </segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus).     </segment5>
