		<segment1>Nobody else could've changed my heart. Nobody else could've saved me. Picked up the pieces when I fell apart. I'm so glad You unchained me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You are the One that I love. Light of the world sent from above. Sing hallelujah shout to the Lord. You are the One. You are the One. You are the One. You are the One I love</segment2>
		<segment3>If I knew the song that the angels sing. We'd be singing together. I can't wait for eternity. Praising Your name forever. (Repeat chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: Lord search my heart. And find it ever true. I pray that my devotion. Always be to You</segment4>
		<segment5>(Repeat chorus 2 times)</segment5>
		<segment6>You are the One that I love. Light of the world sent from above. You are the One that I love. (Repeat)    </segment6>
