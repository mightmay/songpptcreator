		<segment1>Been ostracized for 12 years. I'm used to being alone. Spent everything I had. And now it's gone. I'm used to being put down. My issues tell it all. My only hope is anchored. In this fall</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. If I could just touch the hem of His garment. I know I'd be made whole. If I could just press my way through this madness. His love would heal my soul. If only one touch</segment2>
		<segment3>. So many people calling. How could He ever know. That just a brush of Him. Would stop the flow. If He knew would He rebuke me. Or shame me to the crowd. Well I'm desperate 'cause it's never or it's now</segment3>
		<segment4>. If I could just touch the hem of His garment. I know I'd be made whole. If I could just press my way through this madness. His love would heal my soul.</segment4>
		<segment5/>
		<segment6>And then suddenly He turned around. He said somebody has unleashed my power. Well, frightened and embarrassed I bowed. You see I told Him of my troubles. And how..</segment6>
		<segment7>. I had to touch the Hem of His garment. And i know I've been made whole. And how I had pressed my way through this madness. And His love has healed my soul.</segment7>
		<segment8>. Then with one word He touched the hem of my garment. And you know I've been made whole. And somehow He pressed His way throught my madness. And His love has healed my soul.</segment8>
		<segment9>. I tell you He Touched me. He reached way down and touched me. When no one else would touch me. Jesus shol' 'nough [[sure enough]] He touched me.. And I know I've been made whole    </segment9>
