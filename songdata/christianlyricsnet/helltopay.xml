		<segment1>(verse 1). Life is like a jewel. Given to you. Sin is like a thief. Trying to take it away</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). It's coming to steal it today. You better get your attitude straight. Before you have Hell to pay</segment2>
		<segment3>(verse 2). It stung me like a bee. This world's philosophy. It tried to suck me dry. A vampire bite</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). It's coming to steal it away. You'd better get your attitude straight. Or you're gonna have Hell to pay</segment4>
		<segment5>(verse 3). So lock your window. And don't let go. To what you know is true. Or it'll take it from you</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus). It's coming to take it away. You'd better get your attitude straight. Or you're gonna have Hell to pay. (repeat).     </segment6>
