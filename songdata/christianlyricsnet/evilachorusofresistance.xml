		<segment1>Everyone down on the floor. No sudden moves and lock the door. I've got this feeling I'm chasing. I'll never rest until I find it</segment1>
		<segment2>See, I've been plotting away. In my heart every day. To put this plan into action. And though I try to resist. I find the thing is this. Until I get it there's no satisfaction</segment2>
		<segment3>I want something you have. You must meet my demands. Don't move, hand it over. I won't stop until it's in my hands</segment3>
		<segment4>Deep in the recess of every man is a thief, a robber, a criminal. Below the surface of every hero is an envy, a restless evil</segment4>
		<segment5>See, I've been plotting away. In my heart every day. To put this plan into action. And though I try to resist. I find the thing is this. Until I get it there's no satisfaction</segment5>
		<segment6>I want something you have. You must meet my demands. Don't move, hand it over. I won't stop until it's in my hands    </segment6>
