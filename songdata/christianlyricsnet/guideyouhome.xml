		<segment1>Has your love run dry. A flower under the desert sky. withered before your eyes. Have your flood walls failed. Built so high still the storm prevailed. And the water rises to your soul</segment1>
		<segment2>If you're a ship and you're lost in the ocean. I'll be the wind in your sails give you motion. I will guide you home. If you're too far out that you can't see the shoreline. I'll be the light house shining in the night time. I will guide you home</segment2>
		<segment3>Is your compass wrong. Misplaced trust for far too long. Off track and you can't get back. Did you loose your calm. You're not sure where but you know it's gone. It's a sad sad song playing in your soul</segment3>
		<segment4>If you're a ship and you're lost in the ocean. I'll be the wind in your sails give you motion. I will guide you home. If you're too far out that you can't see the shoreline. I'll be the light house shining in the night time. I will guide you home</segment4>
		<segment5>When the night is long. When the storm is strong. I will guide you. I will guide you home (2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>If you're a ship and you're lost in the ocean. I'll be the wind in your sails give you motion. I will guide you home. If you're too far out that you can't see the shoreline. I'll be the light house shining in the night time. I will guide you home</segment6>
		<segment7>When the night is long. When the storm is strong. I will guide you. I will guide you home (2x)    </segment7>
