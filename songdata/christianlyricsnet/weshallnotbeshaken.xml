		<segment1>When everything's breaking. You are left unshaken. When everything's tumbling down. You're the solid ground. Nations could be quaking. Economies failing. When fear is found all around. You're the solid ground</segment1>
		<segment2>Our God, You are all that You say You are. You never change, You never fail, You never fade. Our God, You are faithful in all Your ways. Forever You stand, forever You reign, forever remain. And we shall not be shaken</segment2>
		<segment3>We shall, we shall not be shaken. We shall, we shall not be shaken. When all around is sinking sand. For You are, You are never changing. You are, You are never changing. You will stand, the Great I Am     </segment3>
