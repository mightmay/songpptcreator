		<segment1>Collapsing was much softer. Still falling always hurt. Only after sensing your love. For always ever burned </segment1>
		<segment2>You justified my folly. My affluent disguise. Removed revealing nothing. Yet nothing unforgiven lies. Unforgiven lies </segment2>
		<segment3>No one loves me like you. No one loves me the way you do. No one loves me like you. No one loves me the way, the way that you do </segment3>
		<segment4>To touch the rose unfearful. Is to meet the thorn. And pierce the heart's emotion. And feel the emptiness no more. Emptiness no more </segment4>
		<segment5>Took some time to realize I've fallen     </segment5>
