		<segment1>Word and music: Bob Hartman </segment1>
		<segment2>From the depths of the deep blue sea. To the end of the heavenlies. He is God over all the earth. To the end of the universe </segment2>
		<segment3>He reigns from his throne on high. He reigns over you and I. Ill testify </segment3>
		<segment4>Too big, too big. Our God is too big to fail. Too big, our God is too big. Too big, too big. Our God is too big to fail. Too big, our God is too big to fail </segment4>
		<segment5>Hes loving and merciful. His grace is unsearchable. Hes Lord over sea and sod. There is none who is like our God </segment5>
		<segment6>He stretched forth the heavens. And He laid the foundations of the earth     </segment6>
