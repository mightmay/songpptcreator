		<segment1>So follow me to the empty ocean. We can watch the city. do you sit behind the skylight. It happens?. we float away and forget about the way you used to be. tonight i feel were never wanting to let you drown without me. tonight we are the only ones to watch it fall apart</segment1>
		<segment2>We sat into our place where i can watch you swim. Dont forget my hands still wrapped around your neck. We fall deeper into the ground this night has never looked so hollow. I wanted to share this with you, with you. I'll wait till it opens up again, sit here till the water reaches our necks. Finally get to watch them wash away the night</segment2>
		<segment3>Tonight i feel but i never wanted to let you drown without me without me</segment3>
		<segment4>Open your lungs follow me down. Open your lungs follow me down</segment4>
		<segment5>I said this up keep swimming keep swimming. Oh god i am emptier than you    </segment5>
