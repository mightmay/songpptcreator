		<segment1>With open arms. I'll be held down by the Spirit of God. I refuse to turn away. By the world and its lies. Everlasting words like water flows through my heart. As the wisdom runs deep within Foreseen through my Savior. The complication has been done. With wisdom and truth inside. No reflections from the past will come. And there will be no misconception. That would turn my faith away when I'm with You. Life the endless maze will not be so narrow. Soon time will not have to wait. For soon I will go against what awaits me. With open arms I'll be held down by the Spirit of God. I refuse to turn away. By the world and its lies. Everlasting words like water flows through my heart. As the wisdom runs deep within Foreseen through my Savior. The complication has been done With wisdom and truth inside. No reflections from the past will come. And there will be no misconception. That would turn my faith away when I'm with You. I will lift up my spirit to be with You.     </segment1>
