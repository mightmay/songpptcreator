		<segment1>The battle is more intense than it. has ever been. lord, I need you and want. You so desperately. please hang on to me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Another million miles from the truth now. I know there's peace but I can't figure out how. To stop this race that's taking over me, i'm. Under the gun I wait for you to see</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, please reach out to me. Open my eyes to see. I'm running from you now. Come rescue me somehow</segment3>
		<segment4>Another scar from fighting the truth now. Has left me like a stranger to my need now. A masquerade, a game to figure out now. A cruel charade I cannot scream aloud</segment4>
		<segment5>A narrow stretch of road in the way now. A heavy load still hanging on to me now. I'm in a maze that I can't seem to get out. Without a view from these shoulders of doubt    </segment5>
