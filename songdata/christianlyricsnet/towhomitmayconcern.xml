		<segment1>So hold your head up high and know it's the end of the road. Walk down this beaten path before you pack your things and head. Home. At the end of the road you'll find what you've been longing for</segment1>
		<segment2>I know cause my feet have the scars to show. I was lost with vague direction and no place to call home</segment2>
		<segment3>It's time for you to press on. This is not your war. Set your sites to the North and press on. This is not your escape. Wash away what they though of you. Because in this place, we're all as good as dead. end cycle</segment3>
		<segment4>Behind the mask you'll find yourself alone.     </segment4>
