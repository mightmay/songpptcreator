		<segment1>If you want a heart of sympathy. Then pray to God to help you, please. See the world that Jesus sees. Yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>But be careful what you ask Him for. Cause if youre gonna open up that door. Theres no going back to before</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause once you see a mother who cant feed. The baby that cries in her arms. Your heart will break and youll lay awake. No, sleep wont come quick anymore. So do you want to know?</segment3>
		<segment4>You pass him on the way to work. He holds a sign beside the curb. You look away and avoid the hurt</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause why should you be held responsible. Besides, hell probably just spend it all. On cigarettes and alcohol</segment5>
		<segment6>But once you see that the man on the street. Has a name and a family like you. Your heart will break and youll lay awake. Cause youll understand God loves him, too. So do you want to know?. Oh, no</segment6>
		<segment7>If you want a heart of sympathy. Then pray to God to help you see</segment7>
		<segment8>But once you see a world thats in need. And a sorrow you just cant ignore. Your hearts gonna break and youll lay awake. Cause youll know you could do so much more. Do you want to know?    </segment8>
