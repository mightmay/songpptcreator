		<segment1>(Goldie! Hey Goldie)</segment1>
		<segment2>Puppy love, puppy love. Yes she gave all she had. Not like a brother or sister more like. A mom or a dad</segment2>
		<segment3>We never asked her. Never gave her a choice. We just barked out commands. Sit, stay, don't beg stop licking my hand. Those days are gone now. I wish goldie could come out and play</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). Goldie's last day, goldie's last day. If a picture paints a thousand words. There's nothing left to say. Wish you could have been there for goldie's last day</segment4>
		<segment5>She was 11 to you and me. What's that in dog years?. 77, that's more than 11. She outlived her peers. The talk around town is that goldie passed away</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>We are confident that this incident was not an accident. (As per our investigation). Confident that this incident was not an accident. We are confident that this incident was not an accident. (She never missed a vaccination). Confident that this incident was not an accident</segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus)    </segment8>
