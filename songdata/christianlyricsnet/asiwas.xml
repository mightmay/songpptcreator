		<segment1>Well the sun has come down. And I can't see the light. Can you believe this. I can't receive this. She was standing over there. And now she's out of sight. I can't concieve this. She seems so conceited. She's gone and I know that I need her</segment1>
		<segment2>Understand me as I was. No mistake without a cause</segment2>
		<segment3>Well the campfire started. She sat way over there. In her new sweater. I just gotta get her. She finaly walked apst. And I could smell her hair. So I wrote a letter. I'll never forget her. She's gone and I know that I need her</segment3>
		<segment4>Let me ride on your wings. We share all our thoughts while we sing. We go on our way    </segment4>
