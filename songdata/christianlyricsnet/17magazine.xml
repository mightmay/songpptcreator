		<segment1>Talked to my sister late last night. And she gave me some advice. And what she said was right. Talked to my sister late last night. I said I've got her on my mind. She said it's good I know my kind. And maybe this time, maybe she's just the one you need. Keep taking your time, you shouldn't go for her full speed. Cause I know that I've never seen your motives more squeaky clean, and my 17 magazine tells me that your in love. Jessica told me that I should take a quiz. 10 yes or no questions to tell me what love really is. I searched for my answers, I lied and said I like nsync. They said my middle name's don juan, and I'm sure of myself I think. Cause I say if your asking me, love is sacred love is sweet, and my 17 magazine tells me that your in love.     </segment1>
