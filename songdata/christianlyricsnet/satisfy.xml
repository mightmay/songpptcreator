		<segment1>Before the sun has touched the sky. Colors bursting from Your eyes. Before the flood of the morning light</segment1>
		<segment2>Before the earth has felt Your heat. Before I stand up to my feet. Before I begin to feel this weak</segment2>
		<segment3>Satisfy me, Lord. Satisfy me, Lord. I'm begging You to help me see. You're all I want , You're what I need. Satisfy me, Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>And when the day is closing in like the stars in the night. I am falling into the pull of the earth and its affections</segment4>
		<segment5>In me, O Lord, can You create a pure heart?. Because I'm afraid that I just might run back. To the things I hate</segment5>
		<segment6>You're beautiful. You're beautiful. You're more than all this world can give. You're beautiful. You're beautiful. Your love is all I need to live</segment6>
