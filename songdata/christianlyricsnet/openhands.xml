		<segment1>To give unselfishly. to serve the least of these. Jesus I'm learning how to live with open hands. All these treasures that I own. will never satisfy my soul. Jesus I lay them at your throne with open hands</segment1>
		<segment2>chorus. I lift my hands open wide. let the whole world see. how you love, how you died, how you set me free. free at last, I surrender all I am with open hands, with open hands</segment2>
		<segment3>To finally let go of my plans. these earthly kingdoms built of sand. Jesus at your cross I stand with open hands</segment3>
		<segment4>bridge. You took the nails, You bore the crown. You hung your head, Your love poured out. You took my place, You paid the price. so Jesus now I will give my life    </segment4>
