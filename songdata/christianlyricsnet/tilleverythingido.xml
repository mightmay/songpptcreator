		<segment1>Bob Hartman. Col. 3:17</segment1>
		<segment2>I can never hide away in a place that you won't see. Caught between the way I am and the way I wanna be. You can take away the mask that hides the man inside. You illuminate the ways of darkness I deny</segment2>
		<segment3>And even though you see, You keep on lifting me</segment3>
		<segment4>Till everything I do, I do for you. Through every test of faith You take me through. Till every path I take is straight and true. Till everything I do, I do for you</segment4>
		<segment5>One by one you chip away at the edges of my heart. Till you see the hardness and the willfulness depart</segment5>
		<segment6>You let me see my pride, then pull me to your side</segment6>
		<segment7>Till everything I do, I do for you. Through every test of faith You take me through. Till every path I take is straight and true. Till everything I do, I do for you</segment7>
		<segment8>Though I grow closer to the end that you intend for me. I won't be all I'm meant to me. Till face to face I see</segment8>
		<segment9>Till everything I do, I do for you. Through every test of faith You take me through. Till every path I take is straight and true. Till everything I do, I do for you.     </segment9>
