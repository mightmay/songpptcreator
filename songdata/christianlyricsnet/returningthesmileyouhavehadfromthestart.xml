		<segment1>You wanted to know us. If it was for the pain that its caused us. For the lies, such a white lie. Don't know what it was to deserve this</segment1>
		<segment2>As simple as I can. I'll tell you the difference. Between a pencil and a pen. And where it will leave us. Now as your body lets you die. And I sit here still alive</segment2>
		<segment3>In my memory I wrote you down in ink. I never wanted to erase your story. Even with the tragedy it brings</segment3>
		<segment4>The fluid in your lungs. That tells you you're losing. Stop breathing. the medicine that comes. Will fix you, will help you. But takes you from conscious to sleep. Place my hands to face and weep</segment4>
		<segment5>In my memory I wrote you down in ink. I never wanted to erase your story. even with the tragedy it brings</segment5>
		<segment6>Smiling, beautiful. Something torn from my hands</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm not ready for you to die. [screaming]</segment7>
		<segment8>This day will end. With the lies complete. My closest friend. Here in front of me. [screaming]</segment8>
		<segment9>You wanted to know us. If it was for the pain that its caused us. For the lies, such a poor thing. Don't know what it was to deserve this    </segment9>
