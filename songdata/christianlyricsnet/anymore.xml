		<segment1>I can't hide the way I feel about you anymore. I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes anymore. My tears no longer waiting..my resistance ain't that strong. My mind keeps recreating a life with you alone. And I'm tired of pretending that I don't love you anymore</segment1>
		<segment2>Let me make one last appeal to show you how I feel about you..hmmm. Cause there's no one else I swear, holds a candle, anywhere, next to you. My heart can't take the beating of not having you to hold. A small voice keeps repeating deep inside my soul.. It says I can't keep pretending that I don't love you anymore</segment2>
		<segment3>I've got to take the chance or let it pass by. If I expect to get on with my life. With my life..</segment3>
		<segment4>And I can't hide the way I feel about you anymore. And I can't hold the hurt inside, keep the pain out of my eyes anymore. My tears no longer waiting. Oh, my resistance ain't that strong. Oh, my mind keeps recreating a love with you alone. And I'm tired of pretending I don't love you anymore..anymore..anymore    </segment4>
