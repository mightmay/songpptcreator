		<segment1>Farewell old friends. This has been the best it could've been. Farewell old friends. And we won't forget. The times we've spent</segment1>
		<segment2>As for me and my countrymen. We are headed out to sea. And there's no way that this is the end for them or for me. So farewell</segment2>
		<segment3>For now, farewell. This has been a tale. We hope you'd tell. Don't forget what we've become. And the training's worht the time it took. Now that it is done</segment3>
		<segment4>When the waves. They come crashing in. Well, I will stand and sing. There is nothing for us to fear. We're in the service of the good King. The good King</segment4>
		<segment5>So farewell, farewell. Farewell old friends. Farewell, farewell. Farewell old friends     </segment5>
