		<segment1>she's got dreams dreams that he's got things. that'll open up her sky so she can use her wings. to fly away. she looks out her window. watching people as they pass on by. some of them want to come inside. man oh man one on one i wonder which one will she trust. cuz some men only lust. and she wants a man who can understand. what a woman wants and if he can appreciate her and not deface her. and she wants a king with a diamond ring. not some prince charming who's gonna steal everything that he gave her. yea. she's got to fly away (uh 1-2, uh 1-2, uh 1-2). i watch her walk next to you but soon. she's got to get away (oh that's true, oh that's true, oh that's true). i hope her dreams do come true. cuz she is a butterfly. spreadin spreadin spreadin spreadin. spreading her wings. (she's beautiful, she's beautiful, she's beautiful). but her heart is a kingdom without a king. and without him she can't sing. so she waits on a watchtower. hoping praying waiting for his arrival (and all the people in the world say). and then they'll. and she wants a family (family) she wants a lover (lover). she wants a best friend closer than any other. a man that's true she wants a man who. can hear god's voice and know what he is called to do. she wants a hard worker not some lazy bum. but a man who knows how to get the job done. she wants a family to be a mother and raise a child that came from her. yea. she's got dreams dreams that he's got things things. that'll open up her sky so she can use her wings. to (to to) fly away. she's got dreams dreams that he's got things things. that'll open up her sky so she can use her wings. to (to to) fly away. she's got to fly away (fly away). she's got to find her way. she's got to fly away. she's on the ground learning to fly but she's flying now. she's on the ground it's time to fly she's gonna fly now. she's on the ground looking down it's time to fly ya'll. she's on the ground but watch her rise and fly away. she was looking down but now she's looking to the sky ya'll. spreading her wings to give it a try give it a try give it a try. to fly away when the rest of the girls are on the fall ya'll. she's spreading her wings to fly away. cuz she's got dreams dreams that he's got things things. that'll open up her sky so she can use her wings. to (to to) fly away    </segment1>
