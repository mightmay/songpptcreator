		<segment1>I watched. The stars. Roll from your eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>Only to compensate. Disaster from your disguise. The Brilliance of your lies. Distance from the start. Relapse from the heart.</segment2>
		<segment3>. Constance keep me, Or will she just keep staring</segment3>
		<segment4>. I watched the leaves change. As you watched me slip away. I watched the leaves change. As you watched dreams fade to gray</segment4>
		<segment5>Blister the eyes. Of plastered promises.    </segment5>
