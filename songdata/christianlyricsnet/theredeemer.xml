		<segment1>Sometimes I just wanna start over. Cuz everything looks like a wreck. And I need the courage to carry on. Cuz I cant see whats ahead</segment1>
		<segment2>And there are places Ive wished I could be. Battles Ive wanted to win. Dreams that have slipped through my hands. I may never be back again</segment2>
		<segment3>But Im still a dreamer. A believer. Oh, I lost my faith in so many things. But I still believe in You. Cuz You can make anything new</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes I just wish we could say. All the things that are easy to hear. Ignore the injustice we see. And explain every unanswered prayer. But Id rather speak honestly. And wear a tattered heart on my sleeve. Cuz in the middle of my broken dreams. Redemption is here</segment4>
		<segment5>And Im still a dreamer. A believer. Oh, I lost my faith in so many things. But I still believe in You. Cuz You are the answer. The Redeemer. Oh, Ive given up on too many things. But Im not giving up on You. Cuz You can make anything new</segment5>
		<segment6>I dont have every answer in life. But Im trusting You one day at a time. Cuz You can make a weak heart stay alive. Forever. And this is where heaven and earth collide. I lift my hands, I give my life. This is how my weary heart stays alive</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, Im still a dreamer. Still a believer. And You are the answer. The Redeemer. Cuz You can make anything new. Yeah, You can make anything new    </segment7>
