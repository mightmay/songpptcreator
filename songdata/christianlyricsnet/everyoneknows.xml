		<segment1>Love grows stronger. When you give it away. I'm holding on to see the sunrise, your eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>You have this wonder and it's beautiful. It makes my face shine like the sunrise, your eyes. Time to realise</segment2>
		<segment3>It was love that saved us and love will save again. Only love can save us and love will save again</segment3>
		<segment4>Everyone knows that this fire grows. And I'm a, a man who knows where this fire glows</segment4>
		<segment5>I love to hear you singing. Sweet redemption songs. Your face is brighter than the. Sunrise, your eyes, time to realise. It was love that saved us, and love will save again. Only love can save us, and love will save again    </segment5>
