		<segment1>Don't get jaded now. Cause it ain't over. Before you know somehow. We're going to find some closure. I've been unwound. But I won't break. And I have found. It's not too late</segment1>
		<segment2>So, don't get jaded now. The sun will rise. Don't get jaded now. We will survive. Don't get jaded now. We're still alive</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm in need of resurrection. Won't you please. Bring new direction. Cause, all my faith is nearly gone. And I'm so tired of holding on</segment3>
		<segment4>But, don't get jaded now. The sun will rise. Don't get jaded now. We are alive. Don't get jaded now. We will survive</segment4>
		<segment5>And oh it's been great trip. Getting here. We all got lost in music. Then came fear. And I'm so scared. But I can't be scared</segment5>
		<segment6>I will make it through. You will make it through. I will make it through. Yeah we'll make it through</segment6>
		<segment7>Don't get jaded now. Don't get jaded now</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm not scared. Hold on. Don't get jaded now the sun will rise     </segment8>
