		<segment1>I have seen my own gravestone and worshiped the golden statue. Ive made my bed in the lion's den and walked in dead man's shoes. I have witnessed coastline from a bird's eye view. And I made the request that we plunge to our death so that I could get to You</segment1>
		<segment2>I will walk through the fire. I will not be afraid. They can take everything that I have. But they cant give me my name</segment2>
		<segment3>I have climbed every bookshelf. In search of hardcover proof. And if I am judged by the things I have loved. I hope some of them are true</segment3>
		<segment4>&quot;Do whatever fulfills you. Make the most of each day&quot;. Thats what were taught since before we could walk. But it all will fade away     </segment4>
