		<segment1>Force me to open my mouth. Again because they know I don't want to. Speak loud when they make me feel. Like a boy scout. So hard to tell them You love them to. I can't give much if I punch back at. The one who hits first. Trying to make me feel ashamed. Because I'm touched. God help me see them. See my thirst</segment1>
		<segment2>Tensed. But still so calm. Alright. Leaning on your arm. Beautiful spirit. Talk to me. Holy Spirit. Walk with me</segment2>
		<segment3>They are liberated minds. I'm a narrow-minded fool. Why must it be. That a discussion is about beating. My mouth will be. Closed if there's no one seeking</segment3>
		<segment4>You know I will be there. Love is so convincing. My words don't come out right. I will stay but not fight. Everybody believes in god. But it seems like no one does in You. But I do</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm not ashamed    </segment5>
