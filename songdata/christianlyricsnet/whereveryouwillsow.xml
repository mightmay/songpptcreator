		<segment1>So lately you're wondering who really cares to take Christ's grace. Well, Christ taught that seeds of new life get scattered on Earth's face. If a grain of wheat shall fall, yeah, fall upon good soil. In between the sand and stone, Good News makes that crop to grow</segment1>
		<segment2>Yes, I've learned that Christ's word will grow wherever you will sow. Wait a while, hold out hope -- it grows wherever you will sow</segment2>
		<segment3>And maybe you're fried now, afraid you've wasted bags of grain. You watered, you tried to do your darnedest, all in vain. If as great a faith as Paul's can follow after Saul. Then there's hope for someone out there who you think rejected you</segment3>
		<segment4>Yes, I've learned that Christ's word will grow wherever you will sow. There's all kinds of ground of though -- it grows wherever you will sow. Some it may hit the rocks, some it may hit the road. Some it may hit the thorns</segment4>
		<segment5>I know now there's dry ground but lives you love might still grow strong. Give their hearts some more time and state the truth for all mankind</segment5>
		<segment6>Yes I've learned that Christ's word will grow wherever you will sow. We all cry, we'll shout though -- as Psalm 126 will show. We might return back cryin' -- God's word is never useless though. Read Isaiah 55 -- by verse 11 you will know. It grows wherever you will sow    </segment6>
