		<segment1>This is the sound of the secret place. This is the sound that the angels sing. This is the sound of the coming rain. This is the sound of my heart's desire. This is the sound that my spirit sings. This is the sound of the coming rain. Come, like you promise</segment1>
		<segment2>This is the groan from the deepest place. This is the incense that fills the earth. This is the sound of the coming rain. This is the sound of the hope within. This is the song that the prophet sings. This is the sound of the coming rain</segment2>
		<segment3>Come, like you promise. These are the words that creation cries. These are the songs of injustice and pain. This is the sound of the coming rain. Come, like you promise    </segment3>
