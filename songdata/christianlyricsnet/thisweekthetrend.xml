		<segment1>And this week the trend. Was to not wake up till 3pm. I picked the few conscious hours that I chose to spend. And slept away the rest of them. And this week the trend. Was to crash and burn and then return again. To practice the life that I pretend. Provides enough to get me through the weekend. So I say. Give me a solution. And watch me run with it. And then you gave. You gave me a solution. What have I done with it. Cause I was absolutely sure. I had it all figured out. Way back then. And now it's this minute, This hour, This day. And this week the trend. Was to backstab every single one of my friends. And leave a voicemail message trying to make amends. All the while hoping things work out in the end. And this week the trend. Was to borrow all the strength that you could lend. To keep my head above the water and not descend. Back to where I said I'd never go again. So I say. Give me a solution. And watch me run with it. And then you gave. You gave me a solution. What have I done with it. Cause I was absolutely sure I had it all figured out. Way back then. But after this day it's this week all over again. And I just want to get mugged at knifepoint. To get cut enough to wake me up. Cause I know that I don't want to die. Sitting around watching my life go by. And what we take from this is what we'll get. And we havn't quite figured it out just yet. Because all of us are all to stuck. Strapped to a chair watching our lives blow up. Stuck watching our lives blow up    </segment1>
