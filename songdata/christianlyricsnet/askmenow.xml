		<segment1>And so one morning just before dawn You came. Out of the forest towards my window. With a smile in Your hand. As the moist air up to Your knees started swirling like smoke. I saw Your lips move. Asking: Did you lose something. I stood glued to the window</segment1>
		<segment2>Emotions running through my vein. Now I know a word I can't explain</segment2>
		<segment3>I think I've known you all along. (Just lost Your face in the crowd for awhile). I think I have been holding my breath all my life. (Can I exhale and go into exile). Ask me now and I'll run away with You</segment3>
		<segment4>And so with the dawn You've come. Eye to eye with nothing in between but this fragile glass. Your lips move again. I try but I can't detect the vibrations in the air. How I've longed to inhale Your breath. It's still early and I see your words getting caught. In the window slowly turning into frost</segment4>
		<segment5>I see Your hand move and I can't detain. Scraping down a word I can't explain</segment5>
		<segment6>I think I've known you all along. (Just lost Your face in the crowd for awhile). I think I have been holding my breath all my life. (Can I exhale and go into exile). Ask me now and I'll run away with You</segment6>
		<segment7>So one morning before dawn you came. (did you lose something)</segment7>
		<segment8>I think I've known you all along. (Just lost Your face in the crowd for awhile). I think I have been holding my breath all my life. (Can I exhale and go into exile). So ask me now and I'll run away with You. I have a will. ask me now and I'll run away with you. (just lost your face in the crowd for a while). ask me now and I'll run away with you. (Can I exhale and go into exile). ask me now and I'll run away with you    </segment8>
