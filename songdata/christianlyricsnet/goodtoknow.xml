		<segment1>Hello old friend. I know it's been awhile. I'm here again and it won't be the last time I fall apart. But you won't let me get too far. Your speaking to my heart. It's good to know. It's good to feel the arms of grace. To know that my mistakes are covered by your love. It's good to know. It's good to see that you won't change. When it's said and done you'll always be enough. To know that I can always come back home. It's good to know whoa. It's good to know whoa. Goodbye old me. Yeah there's so much more that I know I could be. So take my worries with you when you leave. There's hope that I am counting on. Cause I'm never too far gone. It's good to know. It's good to feel the arms of grace. To know that my mistakes are covered by your love. It's good to know. It's good to see that you won't change. When it's said and done you'll always be enough. To know that I can always come back home. It's good to know whoa. It's good to know whoa. It's good to know that there's a second chance. To know that it's all in your hands. Even if I just don't understand. Cause I know that I will be alright. Finally see the other side. Things I've missed. To open up your eyes sometimes. It's good to know. It's good to know. I'm covered by your love. Oh It's good to know. It's good to see that you won't change. Cause when it's said and done you'll always be enough. To know that I can always come back home. (always come back home). To know that you will never let me go. It's good to know whoa. It's good to know whoa. It's good to know. It's good to know whoa    </segment1>
