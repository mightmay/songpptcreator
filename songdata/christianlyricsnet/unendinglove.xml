		<segment1>VERSE 1:</segment1>
		<segment2>There's no silver or gold. And no treasure untold. That could draw me away from Your heart. Neither love of myself. Or of anyone else will do </segment2>
		<segment3>PRE-CHORUS:</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus nothing compares. To this grace that rescues me. Saviour now and forever. Your face is all I seek </segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS:</segment5>
		<segment6>Now all I am. I lay at Your feet. I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty. One thing I know. I find all I need. In Your unending love. In Your unending love </segment6>
		<segment7>VERSE 2:</segment7>
		<segment8>Letting go of my pride. I lay down my desires. Just to worship in Spirit and truth. More than all of my dreams. More than fame I will seek You Lord</segment8>
		<segment9>PRE-CHORUS:</segment9>
		<segment10>Jesus nothing compares. To this grace that rescued me. Saviour now and forever. Your face is all I seek</segment10>
		<segment11>CHORUS:</segment11>
		<segment12>Now all I am. I lay at Your feet. I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty. One thing I know. I find all I need. In Your unending love. In Your unending love</segment12>
		<segment13>Now all I am. I lay at Your feet. I'm humbled by the wonder of Your majesty. One thing I know. I find all I need. In Your unending love. In Your unending love    </segment13>
