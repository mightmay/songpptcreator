		<segment1>Responsibility, sensibility. How many things have escaped you?. Could you try and show concern?. Maybe help me understand. All your friendships are in trouble, you're getting lost in the shuffle. But I'll still be there, even though things aren't the same. I'll still be here when all is said and done. Your personality, it wears on me. How many times have I told you that you could be more than you try to be?. How can you laugh at all your problems?. Seems that they won't go away. You think life's a game and everything's a joke. I'll be there when you're not, just like it's always been. And I know you'll come running back, like things are the same.    </segment1>
