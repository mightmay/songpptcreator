		<segment1>Ready to turn back. I've still got far to go. I'm done with anesthetic. My destination mind fights my identity. I lost my love for every mile from here to there</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Hey everyone come on back 'cause you're comatose. And everyone has got the right to know. Hey everyone come on back for the Mighty One. To everyone's supposed to carry on</segment2>
		<segment3>Are you comfortable being so comfortable. You don't seem to mind at all. Could you run this race. Could you find your place in the wars. Among the tides, beyond the comfort zone you're living in</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Sea song, the shores are far, the depths are low. Sea song, the faithful swim, the sleeping ones drown. We've got the strength to carry on</segment5>
		<segment6>Hey everyone come on back 'cause you're comatose. And everyone has got the right to know. Lend every fear to the Mighty of mighty ones. 'Cause everyone's supposed to carry on    </segment6>
