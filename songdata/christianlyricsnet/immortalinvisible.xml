		<segment1>Immortal, You are not are like a man. That you change your mind. or change your plan. Invisible, our human eyes can't see. The Depths of your majesty</segment1>
		<segment2>You're the God of forever and ever amen. The alpha, omega, beginning and end. We sing hallelujah. We worship in awe. Immortal, invisible God</segment2>
		<segment3>Immortal, You are not bound by death. You're the living God, my very breath. Invisible you are not bound by space. But your glory is filling this place. Yes your glory is filling this place</segment3>
		<segment4>Immortal yet you once died for me, to pay my debt to set me free. Invisible you will not always be. Cause youÂ’re coming to reign as our king. And the saints will fall down at your feet    </segment4>
