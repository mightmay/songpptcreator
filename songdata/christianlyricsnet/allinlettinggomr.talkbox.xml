		<segment1>
Why's it always circumstantial?. Never any real potential. Obvious and so sequential. It always ends the same. Holding out with all that's in me. Is it worth all this pretending?. A story with an ugly ending it's never worth the pain</segment1>
		<segment2>So right here and now I am all in</segment2>
		<segment3>'Cause I'm letting go of everything I am . And I'm holding on to everything You are. I'm letting go of everything I once was. I'm all in. I'm fallin' into Your arms again</segment3>
		<segment4>Can we just wait out the weather? . I could stay right here forever. Got to get myself together. Real life is on the way. Call it my foregone conclusion. I'll always welcome Your intrusion. You're the master of my choosing. I'm all Yours</segment4>
		<segment5>This time I'm so for real. It's time I sealed the deal. Shut down my lame appeals. I'm letting go. I'm letting go. I'll throw caution to the sky. Kiss all my fears goodbye. This time its do or die. I'm letting go ....
