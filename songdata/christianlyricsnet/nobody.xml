		<segment1>When he was young so many looks he never caught. so much love he hadn't bought. Seen peering through the pane left out standing in the rain. Soaking in his rearing only wishing to be dry. It seems he never knew that no one cut much deeper in the. Young boy who strains his ears to hear. No one come calling no one to tell his deepest fear. No one to brag his trophy no one for him to make proud. No one to answer this life that was in doubt. These times he's not forgotten, he swore he'd never be that nobody still haunting. All his past that brings his longing for times. that all would come from when he was young</segment1>
		<segment2>So many times he'd knelt and prayed begging for these present days. When all his youth was done to be standing with his son. No one would ever know him no one for him not to hear. No one to answer his father being near. These times he's not forgotten and did he ever know that nobody still haunting. All his past that brings his longing for all my strength to come. from when he was young</segment2>
		<segment3>It seems he never knew that nobody. Still staring in at something lost that could not be. All of this spent preparing harmony. He'll never be forgotten. For all he's lived and sought in. Flying from wings he'd hide in. Hiding his son from when he was young. And in his bleeding I've been receiving no pain that would come. from when he was young.    </segment3>
