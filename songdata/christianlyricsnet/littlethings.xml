		<segment1>I don't care what anybody thinks. I will stare when everybody blinks. I don't mind the difference that they see. Cause He loves. Every little thing. Every little thing. Every little thing. Every little thing. Every little thing. About me... I believe that everybody bleeds. Sticks and stones aren't what has cut so deep. I won't buy the hate they sell for free. You can't carry the weight of the world. I won't carry the weight of the world. I can tell the hell that you've been through. It won't make a difference what they do. They'll still tell you all the lies are true. But I love. Every little thing. Every little thing. Every little thing. Every little thing. Every little thing. About you..     </segment1>
