		<segment1>I've betrayed myself so many times. Searching for the answers we know I'll never find. What's the one thing that can put my soul at ease?. A question that we always ask ourselves. Why can't we give without blaming ourselves?. A selfish nation swalloed up with greed. We always take more than we need. Let's bring it back. and try to restore an ideal that's been forced to the floor. Strike the spark. Light the flame. Start the fire. I'll be the flame. We'll be the fire.    </segment1>
