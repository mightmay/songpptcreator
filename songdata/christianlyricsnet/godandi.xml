		<segment1>I have pride, He is meek. I have shame, He is glory. I'm deceitful, He is truthful. I'm not worthy but He is the giver</segment1>
		<segment2>His death for my life. God and I. If apart from Him, I know I will surely, surely die. I know that I'm not much to give. It's only for His love that I have my life to live</segment2>
		<segment3>He has fullness, I am so empty. He is love, I need so much love. He is always there, I am always found. He is the giver, I'm not worthy</segment3>
		<segment4>His death for my life. God and I. If apart from Him, I know I will surely, surely die. I know that I'm not much to give. It's only for His love that I have my life to live    </segment4>
