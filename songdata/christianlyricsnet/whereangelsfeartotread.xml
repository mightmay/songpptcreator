		<segment1>if it wasn't for your mercy. if it wasn't for your love. if it wasnt for your kindness. how could i stand?. if it wasnt for your cleansing. if it wasnt for your blood. if it wasnt for your goodness. how could i stand?</segment1>
		<segment2>yet i find myself again. where even angels fear to tread. where i would never dare to come. but for the cleansing of your blood</segment2>
		<segment3>with you there is forgiveness. and therefore you are feared. Jesus its your loving kindness. that brings me to my knees</segment3>
		<segment4>and i find myself again. where even angels fear to tread. where i would never dare to come. but for the cleansing of your blood</segment4>
		<segment5>in the beauty of your holiness. here in the beauty of your holiness. x2    </segment5>
