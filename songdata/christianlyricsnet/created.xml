		<segment1>you formed us from the dust. You breathed Your breath in us. We are the work of Your hands. Now we breathe back to You. Love songs of gratitude. Adoring You with all we have </segment1>
		<segment2>We were created. To worship Your name. We were created to bring You our praise </segment2>
		<segment3>If we dont worship You. Well search for substitutes. To fill the void in our souls. Worshipping other things. Destroys our liberty. But as we praise You we are free </segment3>
		<segment4>We were created. To worship Your name. We were created to bring You our praise. So we will worship, so we will praise. You our Creator, for all our days </segment4>
		<segment5>This is what we were made to do. This is what we were made to do. So we lift up our praise to You.     </segment5>
