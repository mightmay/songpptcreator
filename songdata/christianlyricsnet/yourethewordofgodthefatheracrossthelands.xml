		<segment1>You're the Word of God the Father. From before the world began. Ev'ry star and ev'ry planet. Has been fashioned by Your hand. All creation holds together. By the power of Your voice. Let the skies declare Your glory;. Let the land and seas rejoice!</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. You're the Author of creation;. You're the Lord of ev'ry man;. And Your cry of love rings out across the lands.</segment2>
		<segment3>Yet You left the gaze of angels, Came to seek and save the lost, And exchanged the joy of heaven. For the anguish of a cross. With a prayer You fed the hungry;. With a word You calmed the sea;. Yet how silently You suffered. That the guilty may go free!</segment3>
		<segment4>With a shout You rose victorious, Wresting vict'ry from the grave, And ascended into heaven, Leading captives in Your way. Now You stand before the Father, Interceding for Your own;. From each tribe and tongue and nation, You are leading sinners home!    </segment4>
