		<segment1>I know I can be a little stubborn. sometimes. You might say, A little righteous andtoo proud. I was lookin' for a way to compromise. Thinkin' maybe I could work things out. I thought I had all the answers. Never givin' in. But You loved me all along. And I admit I was wrong</segment1>
		<segment2>(CHORUS). All I know is I'm lost without You. I'm not gunna lie. I could never be strong without You. I need you be my side. If I ever thought we'd never be together. 'Cause of all my foolish pride. Don't know what I'd do. I'm lost without You</segment2>
		<segment3>I keep tryin' to find my way. But all I know is. I'm lost without You. I keep tryin' to face the day. I'm lost without You. You're the only one. who gets rid of these blues. When I fall You'll catch me every time. The way You give me clarity. when I'm comfused. Just to hear Your voice. can ease my mind. Oh my world's so cold at night. When I wander far away. Only You can make it right. No I'm not too proud to say</segment3>
		<segment4>(CHORUS)</segment4>
		<segment5>I keep tryin' to find my way. But all I know is. I'm lost without You. I keep tryin' to face the day. I'm lost without You. I know that You can hear me now. Make the pain just go away. Stop all the all the tears from. running down my face</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord. (CHORUS)</segment6>
		<segment7>I keep tryin' to find my way. But all I know is. I'm lost without You. I keep tryin' to face the day. I'm lost without You    </segment7>
