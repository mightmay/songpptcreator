		<segment1>Johnny shot to the moon. It's on the nightly news. There's nothing I can do. Johnny shot to the moon. Johnny's got something to say. Johnny's not, he's not coming down today. Johnny thought things would always be the same. Oh no, no, no things can't always be the same. Johnny shot through the roof. No one can get through. Come and see the proof. That Johnny shot through the roof. When you wake up in a war. Torn between your heart and head. Who will win, who'll be defeated?. Johnny, I quit keeping score. Now there's no one left to blame. No one left to leave you cheated. Johnny shot to the moon. I guess it's nothing new. It's sad to say but it's true. Johnny shot to the moon     </segment1>
