		<segment1>I remember the first time                          . 'Til I see beyond the storm. Surrounding me with Your love. I turn to find You near</segment1>
		<segment2>You take me higher. You lift my head to open skies. Your fire burns within my soul. Abandoned to Your call</segment2>
		<segment3>Your love reached deep. Into my world. You read me. Like an open book</segment3>
		<segment4>You took all the pieces. And made my life complete. In You. I soar on the heights. Of Your love. Dive the depths of Your grace</segment4>
		<segment5>You take me higher. 'Til I see beyond the storm. Surrounding me with Your love. I turn to find You near</segment5>
		<segment6>You take me higher. You lift my head to open skies. Your fire burns within my soul. Abandoned to Your call</segment6>
		<segment7>I take the hand of One. Who knows me. From the inside out. He guides me through. The streets of life</segment7>
		<segment8>He take me through. Open doors. They open onto fields of white. He tells me to see. And perceive. And to hear their cry</segment8>
		<segment9>You take me higher. 'Til I see beyond the storm. Surrounding me with Your love. I turn to find You near</segment9>
		<segment10>You take me higher. You lift my head to open skies. Your fire burns within my soul. Abandoned to Your call    </segment10>
