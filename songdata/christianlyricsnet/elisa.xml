		<segment1>You are so special to me. You bring so much joy to my life. I can't imagine what it would be like if you were not around. Only by the grace of god can I enjoy your precious friendship. How was I so blessed?. How was I so blessed?. You mean more than the world to me. You've shown there is more to life than greed through all you've given me. I'll try my best to always be there for you cause that is what you've done for me. It won't always be easy. Sometimes it's give and take, but I'll do my best to take less than I give.</segment1>
