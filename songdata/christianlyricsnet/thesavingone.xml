		<segment1>What mercy was revealed. What selflessness and peace. My fate was surely sealed. Until He rescued me. His pardon for my sin. His bounty for my need. From slavery and shame. I am redeemed </segment1>
		<segment2>And Heaven can't contain. The glory of the Son. Jesus is the Christ, the saving One. His love has made a way. The grave is overcome. Jesus is the Christ, the saving One </segment2>
		<segment3>No fear can hold me down. Nor darkness steal my joy. For blood has been poured out. The enemy destroyed. Death could not hold Him down. The cross was not enough. To steal away His throne. For He is God </segment3>
		<segment4>Anyone who calls upon His name. They will be saved. They will be saved    </segment4>
