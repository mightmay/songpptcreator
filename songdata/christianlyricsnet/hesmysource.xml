		<segment1>Some people are driven by the wind. Some are driven by their madness. But I'm driven by the man. Who had nails driven in His hands</segment1>
		<segment2>He's my source of light. That shines in my darkness. He's my source of living water. That I need every day. He's my sword and my shield. He's the fairest of ten thousand. He's the bright morning star. The soon coming king. The risen Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>He will rise with healing in His wings. He will rise with healing in His wings. He will rise with healing in His wings</segment3>
		<segment4>He's my source of light. That shines in my darkness. He's my source of living water. That I need every day. He's my sword and my shield. He's the fairest of ten thousand. He's the bright morning star. The soon coming king. The risen Lord</segment4>
		<segment5>Some people are driven by the wind. Some are driven by their madness. But I'm driven by the man. Who had nails driven in His hands    </segment5>
