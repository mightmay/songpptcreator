		<segment1>(remake of the Hear'say song) </segment1>
		<segment2>I heard a whisper that touched deep inside my soul. like some familiar melody. a hidden chapter from a story left untold. I gotta feeling, I could believe in. (chorus) </segment2>
		<segment3>there is an angel in my heart. feels like I'm guided by a candle in the dark. its taken all this time. to finally find out what I could never see. an angel in my heart. You were there 4 me. now there is no doubt that there will always be. an angel in my heart </segment3>
		<segment4>You were the friend, You were the one I could confide in. You gave me strength that I could never find. deep emotions that's I've always been denying. I believe in, its so close now, its You that. I'm feeling </segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus) </segment5>
		<segment6>finally found what I been searching for. (all my life). it was right before my eyes. oh u are my angel. i know You'll always be there. You are my one and only angel. to finally found find what I could never see. (You were there for me). now there is no doubt that there will always be. an angel in my heart.     </segment6>
