		<segment1>I hold you in like a deep breath. Feel you like the last beautiful touch before a final rest. I know i'll see you forever. I want it painted black and red. It's so beautiful to me, it's everything i see. It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that i need. And i can't taste anything less. Every time i'm forced down. To be with yourself, take all the blood you want. But not from here. It's so beautiful to me, it is everything i see. It's so beautiful to me, but it's nothing that i need. Not a hand, not a finger. This is my home. I'm dying here. I hide in the corner. That look on your face, I'm accustomed to it.     </segment1>
