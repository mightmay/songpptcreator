		<segment1>Verse 1: Days go by and I'm still sinking here in ever word I could've said. Your gone so far and gone, memories just leave me alone. Find myself running slow as time moves faster</segment1>
		<segment2>I never took the time to say goodbye..</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Wish we would never grow up never grow old never goodbye. Wish we would never grow up never grow old never goodbye. Wish you were here today, Never grow up never grow old never. Leaving me alone, never grow up never grow old</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: I start it over time and time again, rewind the scenes inside my head. What's gone is far and gone, memories won't leave me alone. Find myself growing cold as time moves faster</segment4>
		<segment5>Never took the time to say goodbye was always on the back roads riding high. Some things that I'd like to say wish you were here with me today</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus 2: Wish we would never grow up never grow old never goodbye. Wish we would never grow up never grow old never goodbye. Wish you were here today, Never grow up never grow old never. Leaving me alone, never grow up never grow old</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge: So much more to say.. But time gets in the way.. The Way.    </segment7>
