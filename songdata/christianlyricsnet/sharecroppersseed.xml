		<segment1>He's never been scared of hard work. So why are his hands trembling. And how could something so small. Be all so weighty. On the scales of what could be </segment1>
		<segment2>This tiny seed has potential. For a better way of life. And how he sows it is crucial. For his little ones, his wife </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. So he prays to the Lord of the harvest. Would you rain down on the least of these. Would you please multiply and divide them. These are my sharecropper seeds. These are my Sharecropper seeds </segment3>
		<segment4>It yielded more, than he'd ever hoped for. Enough to take care of things. 'Til the landowner came and said, 'I want more'. And gave him less than agreed </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus. So he cry to the Lord of the harvest </segment5>
		<segment6>. Please remember the least of these. Would you shine on my sons, and my daughters. Cause these are my sharecropper seeds. These are my Sharecropper seeds </segment6>
		<segment7>. So Bring me, my flowers. While I can see them. So that I will know the beauty that they bring, that they bring </segment7>
		<segment8>Stories like these told to me from my mother. Of my grandpa and them back when. She said, most of the good crops, today that I, was reaping. Were sown in love by them </segment8>
		<segment9>So I'm praising the Lord of the harvest. For remembering the least of these. And I'm proud of the title I'm wearing. 'Cause I am Sharecropper seed. Yeah I am the lest of these. God still cares for the least the sharecropper's seed    </segment9>
