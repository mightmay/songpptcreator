		<segment1>Hoping with each new day. I'm moving forward, I push the fear away. And I let go. 'Cause I'm so through with barely hanging on. Leaving what's in the past behind. I come closer to crossing over the line. And I won't stop. Until I get what I've been fighting for. You've said it all before</segment1>
		<segment2>Tell me again that I am strong. Tell me again that I won't fall. I need You here to fix me where I'm wrong. Take me beyond what I can see. Break me, make me believe. You have made me all I need to be</segment2>
		<segment3>Knowing all that I can do is be open when You start to move. In my heart. And now my God, I finally hear Your voice. You've said it all before</segment3>
		<segment4>Who I am is all I've got. And I can't be who I am not anymore</segment4>
		<segment5>(I am strong, make me believe). You have made me all I need to be. (I am strong, make me believe, make me believe)    </segment5>
