		<segment1>Ill walk closer now on the higher way. Through the darkest night will you hold my hand. Jesus guide my way. O you mourn with me and you dance with me. For my heart of hearts is bound to you </segment1>
		<segment2>Though I walk through valleys low. Ill fear no evil. By the waters still my soul. My heart will trust in You </segment2>
		<segment3>O You counsel me and You comfort me. When I cannot see, You light my path </segment3>
		<segment4>My heart will trust in you    </segment4>
