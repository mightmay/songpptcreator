		<segment1>I will sing of my Redeemer. And His wondrous love to me. On the cruel cross He suffered. From the curse to set me free </segment1>
		<segment2>Sing, oh sing of my Redeemer. With His blood, He purchased me. On the cross, He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt, and made me free. </segment2>
		<segment3>I will tell the wondrous story. How my lost estate, to save. In His boundless love and mercy, He, the ransom freely gave. </segment3>
		<segment4>I will praise my Redeemer, His triumphant power I'll tell, How the victory he given. Over sin, and death, and hell    </segment4>
