		<segment1>I thought while on this voyage long. My strength God would increase. And at some point along the way. My struggling would cease. I fought with boldness, wind and wave. And yet the skirmish lost. Exhausted, all provision gone. The channel still uncrossed. As lifeless I in stillness drift. Just strength enough to pray. It's only then I feel the surge. That speeds me on my way</segment1>
		<segment2>By His own hand and faithfulness. He steers me toward a distant shore. And the wind that billows in the sail. Is grace and nothing more. Yes, it's grace and nothing more</segment2>
		<segment3>I seek the bloom of holiness. He leads me deep within. Reveals the hardness of my heart. Unearths my hidden sin. My barren soul groans in despair. In brokenness I cry. Oh, God, I find no hope in me. A smile His sweet reply. For where the tears of brokenness. Have soaked the fallow ground. The tender shoots of holiness. Now spring up all around</segment3>
		<segment4>Strength in my weakness. Joy through the pain. Hope when I'm helpless. Loss my greatest gain    </segment4>
