		<segment1>Every word that I have ever said. Is it true or just what's in my head. I can say my life is in Your hands. But You're askin' me where do I stand. Will they see if I am serious. When it comes to me who do I really trust</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanna give my all and no less. I wanna live my life with no regrets. I'll listen to the call. Cause You gave it all. So when You put me to the test. I'm gonna give You no less</segment2>
		<segment3>Wanna live the dream inside of me. See the plan for who I'm meant to be. Doing all the things I know I can. Not just wishing that I had. Pushin' on and never givin' up. Any less is never gonna be enough</segment3>
		<segment4>You felt so much pain. It's hard to believe. You gave so much away. You came to me with nothing to gain. You offered your best. Jesus You gave Yourself. And now I am giving You no less</segment4>
		<segment5>Wanna give You everything. Nothing holding back. Wanna show You just what I mean. Doesn't matter what they say. No, I don't care about that. You're the only One that I need    </segment5>
