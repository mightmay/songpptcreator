		<segment1>A couple of years and I'm a silhouette. My halo is broken now and I'm all that's left. I hate to disappoint but it's the way things went. I was bound to the things I did. And after what was said. Tie up these loose ends. These voices are calling me out. I've got the solution. You can feed me to something. That is leaving this doubt </segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Whoa, I'm losing hope. There's a hole in my heart. That's been cut out of stone. Whoa, cold comes cold goes. Could you fill this hole?. Cause I can't do it alone </segment2>
		<segment3>A couple of tears and I'm a broken mess. The sadness has taken me far too deep in regret. So sing me a song about something good. My heart's on the thrashing floor. And I've done every single thing I could. I use to believe in. Some kind of feelin'. That could change everything I thought I knew. But that door is closed and. My heart feels like it's frozen. If you hear me I can't feel you </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>(Bridge 4x). The coldest heart can be brought to life. When it's thrown into the fire of goodbyes </segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus 2x) </segment6>
		<segment7>I've got the coldest heart (4x). (Cause I can't do it alone)    </segment7>
