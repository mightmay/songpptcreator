		<segment1>I feel like I've gone astray. just like a runaway. from the grip of Your love. it's not that I wanted to. it's not like I tried to do it that way. I've found there's no distance too far. that could change who You are. that could turn You away. Your love comes rushing in. pouring over me. I know when I come running. You're there for me. there's no way that I could ever lose my way. I know I'm a captive in Your arms. in the grip of Your grace. every day Your mercy's new. and there's nothing I can do to earn Your love. I believe what You say. trust in You. and know Your grace is more than enough. there's no mountain so high. no river so wide. that could ever keep me from You    </segment1>
