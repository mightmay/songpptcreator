		<segment1>WE YOUR PEOPLE COME, IN DESPERATE NEED, TO YOU WE RUN. CALLED BY YOUR GREAT NAME, WITH HUMBLE HEARTS WE SEEK YOUR WAYS. WE BELIEVE IN FAITH, YOUR PROMISES, YOU NEVER BREAK. TURN FROM WICKED WAYS, TO LIVE AS CHRIST FOR ALL OUR DAYS. OH GOD, HIGH UP IN HEAVEN, WONT YOU HEAL OUR LAND. LIVING RAIN, FALL AGAIN OVER MY LIFE AND OVER MY LAND. LIVING RAIN, WASH MY HEART AGAIN. OPEN WIDE HEAVENS SKIES, OVER MY STREET OH SPIRIT RESIDE. LIVING RAIN, FLOOD MY LIFE AGAIN. COME BACK, BACK TO YOUR FIRST LOVE, BACK TO YOUR FIRST LOVE, BACK TO THE CROSS. COME BACK, BACK TO YOUR FIRST LOVE, BACK TO YOUR FIRST LOVE, AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS.    </segment1>
