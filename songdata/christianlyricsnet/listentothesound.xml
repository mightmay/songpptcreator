		<segment1>Are you in over your head. Are you in water so deep you're drowning. Do you think you've been left. And there is no one to feel your hurting. Well, everybody has been there. And everybody's felt lost. If you're in over your head. Lift it up, lift it up</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, listen to the sound of hope that's rising. Up over your horizon. Listen to the sound, listen to the sound. And listen to the sound of a new beginning. Oh, this is where the old is ending. Listen to the sound, listen to the sound</segment2>
		<segment3>I hear you say you're alone. I hear you saying that you'll never make it. I've got to tell you you're wrong. 'Cause I have been down this path you're taking. You never know what faith is. 'Til you don't understand. Sometimes it takes a silence. To finally hear His plan</segment3>
		<segment4>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found. Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound. I once was lost, but now I'm found</segment4>
		<segment5>His Grace is reaching for us. His Grace is reaching out. Listen to the sound, listen to the sound. Wherever you are    </segment5>
