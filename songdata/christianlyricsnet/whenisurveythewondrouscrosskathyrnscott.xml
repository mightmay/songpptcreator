		<segment1>When I survey the wondrous cross. On which the Prince of Glory died. My richest gain I count but loss. And pour contempt on all my pride</segment1>
		<segment2>Forbid it Lord that I should boast. Save in the death of Christ my God. All the vain things that charm me most. I sacrifice them to His blood</segment2>
		<segment3>See from His head His hands His feet. Sorrow and love flow mingled down. Did ere such love and sorrow meet. Or thorns compose so rich a crown</segment3>
		<segment4>Were the whole realm of nature mine. That were an offering far too small. Love so amazing so divine. Demands my soul. Demands my soul. Love demands my soul. My life my all    </segment4>
