		<segment1>Why does your shape attract my eye?. Is it the chemistry of our young bodies prodding us in such hot pursuit of a lie?. We chase a quickly fading phantom. Treasure baby!. If that is so, then one day it shall go. Disappearing as a layer of week-old melting snow. This human heart is never clear. It's half filled up with wonder, and the other half with fear</segment1>
