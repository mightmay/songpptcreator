		<segment1>October wind, chills his skin. He walks home alone. A tiny house, a loving wife. hands worked to the bone</segment1>
		<segment2>But he don't mind his humble life. In this rundown town. To be a sun. A ray of one. Like he's always done</segment2>
		<segment3>And it's alright. To be there where he's always been. He'll live to light. This dark town he's in</segment3>
		<segment4>The clock strikes old, on his achy bones. His final setting sun. And so he rests on an unfamiliar bed. And smiles to the Lord, his love</segment4>
		<segment5>And it's alright. To be there where he's always been. He lived to light. This dark town of sin</segment5>
		<segment6>And so he leaves, and he breathes. A soul so full of his crown. A life that was spent in being content. In the midst of a rundown town.     </segment6>
