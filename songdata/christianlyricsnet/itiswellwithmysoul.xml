		<segment1>When peace like a river attendeth my way. When sorrows like sea billows roll. Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say. It is well, it is well with my soul</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS:]</segment2>
		<segment3>It is well (it is well). With my soul (with my soul). It is well, it is well with my soul. My sin O the joy of this glorious thought. My sin not in part but the whole. Is nailed to the cross and. I bear it no more paraise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul. And Lord haste the day. When my faith shall be sight. The clouds be rolled back as a scroll. The trump shall resound and. The Lord shall descend. Even so it is well with my soul    </segment3>
