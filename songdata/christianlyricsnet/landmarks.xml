		<segment1>Are you hear to stay?. Why should I ask?. The water is warm my friend. This one should last. Landmarks that define. no longer align with the direction we're heading. It's the consequence I fear. when you label me like that. I guess I wish you'd take some time with me. The words I spoke were clear. Some people only hear what they want to hear to make them feel alright.</segment1>
		<segment2>Landmarks that define. no longer align with the direction we're heading. Landmarks that define. no longer align with the song we're singing.</segment2>
		<segment3>Fear it's how you feel. It's the way you feel that keeps you from the truth.</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]    </segment4>
