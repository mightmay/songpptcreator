		<segment1>I'm sorry to be so pointed. But I thought I'd save us both some time. And get myself disconnected. Then work on getting you back in line. I can't believe you'd be so naive. How can anyone be so naive</segment1>
		<segment2>I hope that all of the pride that you've felt. Will melt away with this pre-chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>This song's in a format so I know. That you can wrap your head found it. I know you'll find before you go. That you have faked. Where are all your friends now that you've done this?. I bet you feel fine since you have yourself</segment3>
		<segment4>Just because you cry when confronted. That does not mean that you are right. I'd rather be completely blunt. And get everything out into the light. I suggest you get your facts straight. I suggest you get your self straight</segment4>
		<segment5>I hope that all of the pride that you've felt. Will melt away with this. This moment</segment5>
		<segment6>I bet you feel just perfectly fine. I won't stop til I turn your insides out</segment6>
		<segment7>This song's in a format so I know that you. I know you'll find before. You go that you have faked it. This song's in a format so I know. That you can wrap your head round this    </segment7>
