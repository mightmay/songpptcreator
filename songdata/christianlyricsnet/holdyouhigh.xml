		<segment1>I drank from this cup. 'Til it watered down my soul. I need you so I'll thirst no more</segment1>
		<segment2>I started down this path such a long long time ago. I need to find my way home</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). I want to be the one that holds you high. I want to be the one that gives you glory-only</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to be the one that holds you high. I want to be the one that brings you praise</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm the king of my desires. I've tried them all a thousand times. I have got to choose between this world and you</segment5>
		<segment6>It's got a grip I must admit. I can't explain this emptiness. I hurt without you by my side</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>I've cried to you in my darkest hour. And you brought my soul up from the grave</segment8>
		<segment9>(Chorus)    </segment9>
