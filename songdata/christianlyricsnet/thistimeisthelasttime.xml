		<segment1>Save yourself. Because the only thing that matters. is that you get away from the pain. and the thought of losing your mind. Don't blame yourself. It was everyone around you who made you act this way. There's the stage and your chance to watch it go down.</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't fake yourself into ever, ever thinking about yesterday. That was then, this is now. Don't call it undone. Don't take what you've been dealt. You can exit out the back and make your getaway. before anyone can see the damage you have done.</segment2>
		<segment3>This time is the last time so be here, here now. This time is the last time. Somehow make it through.</segment3>
		<segment4>State your case. You've got everyone's attention. What can you say? Thanks or forget what you've been given. Take your place. Do you think that you deserve the best of everything?. We don't get why you're here. Can you figure it out?</segment4>
		<segment5>This time is the last time so be here, here now.</segment5>
		<segment6>You've got to get away. Oh, I get lost in the thought of losing you. You've got to get away. I know it's a dream but it must be true. Wave now goodbye. It's the lesson that you've been given. You can always move on to better things.</segment6>
		<segment7>This time is the last time so be here, but be here now. This time is the last time somehow. This time is the last time so be here, but be here now. This time is the last time. Somehow make it through. </segment7>
