		<segment1>Speak up. My ears are growing weary. I'll sing this song to the end. And watch the waves crash over me</segment1>
		<segment2>Not too much to overcome with enough time to turn it all around. In a picture perfect scenery I've become a stick figure illustration</segment2>
		<segment3>My eyes roll back and focus on what's ahead. I can still stand if you lend the hand to brace me</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll take this on my own.     </segment4>
