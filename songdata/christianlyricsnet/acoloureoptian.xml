		<segment1>You're on your own now. Dressed in armour. If you run faster you'll forget. They walked along the walls. It was strange enough just to cause an itch. To lie right through my teeth. Except for my situation. My love, I saw your war. In the casting call. On the way to Forum A. And dazzled flies and flying lines. I know you never left the room, I know you. Your on your own now. Dressed in armour. If you run faster you'll forget. The strayers bite their tongues. Cause they feel the tingling violence in their lungs. But I was forced to speak, proclaiming Golden shapes. They hissed out the window, the finger princed a royal colour. Then I heard several gasps: &quot;tell him to slither out!&quot;. Down, down down. Where are the stirrings of old?. I knew you had to last. Your on your own now. Dressed in armour. If you run faster you'll forget. How strange that our character is running from the very people. who sent him away.. It must be those that walk on the walls, those wall walkers put. on a sick and frightful display..    </segment1>
