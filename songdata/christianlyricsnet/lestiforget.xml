		<segment1>I, I sit in silence here. I'm filled with wonder once again. I'm overwhelmed by Your beautiful love. Now I, I'm falling to my knees, so grateful for the grace You give. The love I need I've found in you</segment1>
		<segment2>Lest I forget. All of Your goodness. The blood You have shed. The cross I now remember. Lest I forget</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, You wept tears of blood for me. You hung in agony so deep. Carried my sin away for good. Now I, I take this bread and wine. Remembering You love divine. You walked through fire to free my soul</segment3>
		<segment4>Lest I forget. All of your goodness. The blood you have shed. The cross I now remember. Lest I forget</segment4>
		<segment5>Lest I forget. All of your goodness. The blood you have shed. The cross I now remember. Lest I. Lest I forget. All of your goodness. The blood you have shed. The cross I now remember. Lest I forget. Lest I forget</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord, You, wept tears of blood for me. Carried my sin away for good. Walked through the fire to free my soul. I sit in silence here. The cross I now remember. Lest I forget.     </segment6>
