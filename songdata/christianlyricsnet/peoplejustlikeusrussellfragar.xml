		<segment1>Makes you wanna dance. Makes you wanna sing. Makes you want to shout all about it. Shout all about it. Shout it that Jesus is King</segment1>
		<segment2>Every nation, power and tongue. Will bow down to Your name. Every eye will see. Every hear will hear Your name proclaimed. And this is going to be our cry. Until You come again. Jesus is the only name. By which man can be saved</segment2>
		<segment3>All over the world people just like us. Are calling Your name. Living in Your love. All over the world people just like us. Are following Jesus    </segment3>
