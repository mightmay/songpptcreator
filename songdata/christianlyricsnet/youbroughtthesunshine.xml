		<segment1>You made my day, you came my way. You heard me every, every time I prayed. You gave me peace, you gave me grace. You put a smile upon my face. Chorus: You brought the sunshine (in my life). You are the lifeline (saved my life). Since then I have know Christ. There has been such a change in my life</segment1>
		<segment2>You made my day, you came my way. You heard me every, every time I prayed. You gave me peace, you gave me grace. You put a smile upon my face. (chorus). Jesus is the answer, breaks ever fetter. There's nothing impossible, nothing infallible. Nothing to hard for my God to work out. No matter what the problem. God can always solve 'em. Try Him today, He will brighten up your day. And He'll come your way, he will hear you when you pray. (chorus). I'm a witness that Jesus will make a difference in your life. I'm a witness that Jesus will make a difference in your life. There's nothing impossible, nothing infallible. Nothing to hard for my God to work out. You brought the sunshine and you are the lifeline. You brought the sunshine and you are the lifeline. You brought the sunshine and you are the lifeline. You brought the sunshine and you are the lifeline. Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. (I'm a witness that Jesus will make a difference in your life). (I'm a witness that Jesus will make a difference in your life). (I'm a witness that Jesus will make a difference in your life). (I'm a witness that Jesus will make a difference in your life). I once was lost but now I'm found. Was blind but now I see. You made, you made my day. You came, you came my way. You brought the sunshine in my life. and now I've got a joy divine. Your love it came and changed my day. And now I'm glad to go you way.     </segment2>
