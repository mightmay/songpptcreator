		<segment1>Cut out a heart and then ran away with you. Today I'll start and do the same to you. I'll watch you leave. I'm not what you need.</segment1>
		<segment2>Everyone wants the same as I do. As you wait and bleed, I am trying to forget you.</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll watch you leave. I'm not what you need.</segment3>
		<segment4>Lie to me to make this better, and I won't leave. I will stay. I've made a grave with you. We can sleep now. Entombed, we can sleep now.</segment4>
		<segment5>So this happens once again to a child without sin. Don't say, &quot;This is love.&quot;. Just say, &quot; This is greed&quot;. We'll watch you leave.</segment5>
		<segment6>We won't give up this time. We won't give up. We'll give our all this time. We'll give our all    </segment6>
