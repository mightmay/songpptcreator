		<segment1>I wanna live in the moment. Like there's nothing that I lack. I wanna give like there's nothing to lose. And no reason to look back</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Not so You will love me. Not so You will love me. Not so You will love me. But because You do</segment2>
		<segment3>There's no way to impress You. There's no grace I can earn. Help me to see that my life is a gift. I can give in return</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Because You do. I don't have to prove a thing. Because You do. I am free. Where there's suffering I'll bring comfort. Where there's wandering I will guide. Where there's judgment I'll show mercy. Where there is darkness I'll be light</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
