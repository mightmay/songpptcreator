		<segment1>The charade is over now. Still you're trying to hide it somehow. Am I wrong when I say a piece is missing?. Inside is screaming you stay quiet. No one is listening. You're picking up a shell. No one will ever tell. The difference and so the indifference will come</segment1>
		<segment2>You can't climb out of your empty box alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Grab your hair but you can't lift yourself up. Still you're telling me to shut up. Don't you get fed up with your own pride?. Realize we're on the same side. You are not the first one. Who lost track of the sun. You can't see that now I know</segment3>
		<segment4>Don't want to sound superior. but even though I know this is not a cave can't you see the light. I'll walk beside you tonight    </segment4>
