		<segment1>Try to find the words to express the way You are. But the beauty of the Lord. Can not be described. In just one lifetime. Look at the sun over the seas. Look at Your grace that covers me</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I know, yes I know. Now I know, I know. Your love has saved me</segment2>
		<segment3>In the morning. I can't stop praising Your Name. In the evening. I can't stop praising Your Name</segment3>
		<segment4>In the morning. I can't stop praising Your Name. In the evening, I can't stop</segment4>
		<segment5>And I want you to know. Yes, I want you to know, oh yes I. And I want you to know. Yes, I want you to know</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord You're so amazing. Every word You say is true. Better than the finest treasure. So glad that I found You. You held me close when I was down. Your world has turned my world around</segment6>
		<segment7>Now I know, yes I know. Now I know, I know. How much I love you</segment7>
		<segment8>Hallelujah, we praise Your Name. We praise Your Name     </segment8>
