		<segment1>Get me through, through tonight. Just a taste, let it be sleepless nights. You and me, eyes are wide. Out of line, I'm alive. Right now , we'll get through this. We always do, try to drive</segment1>
		<segment2>All the doubt, from my mind. Sit here and suck it up. And leave the day behind</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm nothing but tired. I'm nothing at all. I'm nothing but broken. I'm ready to fall</segment3>
		<segment4>Comfort and confidence. I am bound. This is the only thing I can feel. Something to guide me here. This will be all that I ask of you. It's all I pray when will I. Get that my life. Is not something that means a thing. I've blown it all away</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm nothing but tired. I'm nothing at all. I'm nothing but broken. I'm ready to fall</segment5>
		<segment6>I turn to you. I burn for you (x2)</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm nothing but tired. I'm nothing at all. I'm nothing but broken. I'm ready to fall     </segment7>
