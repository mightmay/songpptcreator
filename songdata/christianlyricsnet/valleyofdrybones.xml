		<segment1>Behold a valley filled with bones. Bones on every side. A valley flush, a floor so full. Of bones so very dry</segment1>
		<segment2>The Lord did ask, Can these bones live?. Might these bones rise once more?. What else was I to say but you alone can tell O, Lord.</segment2>
		<segment3>A legion I will rise. A resurrected army. A living holy host of a people born again</segment3>
		<segment4>Then prophesy O son of man. Cry out to this dead hord. And when they come to life again. They'll know I am The Lord</segment4>
		<segment5>And when I spoke what I was told. There came a rattling sound. As bone to bone they formed a mass of bodies on the ground</segment5>
		<segment6>The dead will come alive. Their graves will lie abandoned. And all who dwelleth in the dust will wake and shout for joy    </segment6>
