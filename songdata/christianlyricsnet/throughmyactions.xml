		<segment1>ambition stifled. or is it just deterred?. narrowness of scope. the new kind of hope. acceptance of impurities are few in between. losing myself i was a compassionate being. down!. i feel i am rotting inside. help me!. reality subsides. holding on!. stop my soul from bleeding. carry out!. the state of my mind's redeeming. the choices i made. the price i paid. was never enough. it will never be enough. don't tell me what to feel. the truth will be revealed through my actions. not my words. i don't understand the way we treat each other. i don't understand why we rape one another. i won't accept what's been accepted. i'll love all that's been neglected. my actions show. show that i care. i won't sit back. i won't sit back and stare. i won't accept what's been accepted. i'll love all that's been neglected. i'll make a change. i'll make it better for you    </segment1>
