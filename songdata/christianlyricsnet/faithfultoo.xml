		<segment1>Its a brand new day and the sun is shining bright. Looks like its gonna be the very best day of my life. So I jump out of bed into a world of opportunities. I gotta get movin, no time to get down on my knees. Then the telephone rings. Its the voice of tragedy. Now I suddenly find. The time to get down on my knees</segment1>
		<segment2>I say, I love You. I always look to You when trouble calls my name. But if Im gonna say, I love You. Ive gotta be faithful too. The true test of my love will be. Did I follow You consistently. Through the good and bad. I want to be faithful too</segment2>
		<segment3>Talk is cheap. Some words come a dozen for a dime. But a real life conversation. Will take some precious time. And if I give my all. Lord thats the least that I can do. Compared to all the faithfulness. I have found in You. So if tragedy calls. Or if everything goes my way. I want to be found. Faithful to You every day </segment3>
