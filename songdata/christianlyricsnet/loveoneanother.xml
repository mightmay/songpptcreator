		<segment1>I had a dream that I was speaking. With a prophet from the land of wise. In a crowd of people from the land of troubled hearts. I said, &quot;We've come here for answers -. A solution to our world's demise&quot;. He said the journey would be long. But here's where you start</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Love one another, love one another. Work it in to work it out. There could never be enough. Love one another, love one another. Cause you know without a doubt. You can change your world with love</segment2>
		<segment3>It was a simple conclusion. But I thought that it was rather profound. Just a fundamental law that we should all live by. I took it in to tomorrow. Yeah, I walked the earth but I never found. Any corner of the world. Where this did not apply</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>And looking out I saw no method to the madness there. Like in a vision from the Isle of Patmos, I was scared. It was a revelation. Love is getting rare</segment5>
		<segment6>The people of the land united. And in my dream we all agreed. That we should start again. And this would be our creed</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)    </segment7>
