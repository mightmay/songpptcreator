		<segment1>thinking about when we began. i don't know if i can. have i become a man. times have never been so hard. all i wanted was a dream to call my own</segment1>
		<segment2>well live and let die. grin and get by</segment2>
		<segment3>words of wisdom to survive. and i will get by. i'm gonna make it happen. with my back against the wall. i'm gonna make it happen. so i'll see you at the top</segment3>
		<segment4>in a world of live and take. i have to contemplate. could this be my fate. stick a fork in me i'm done. little did you know i've only just begun</segment4>
		<segment5>well words were spoken. hearts were broken</segment5>
		<segment6>still the song remains the same. till i come another day. i'm gonna make it happen. with my back against the wall. i'm gonna make it happen. with my two feet on the ground. i'm gonna make it happen. nobody's gonna see me fall. i'm gonna make it happen. so i'll see you at the top</segment6>
		<segment7>so go ahead and try to find. a way to judge my mind. and think that it's all right. but don't look down on me. for wanting to succeed. cuz this is my big dream. been given unto me</segment7>
		<segment8>so what am i supposed to do. to keep my eyes on you. it's gonna see me through. nothing left for me to say. i'll be coming back come back another day</segment8>
		<segment9>well live and let die. grin and get by</segment9>
		<segment10>words of wisdom to survive. and i will get by. i'm gonna make it happen. with my back against the wall. i'm gonna make it happen. with my two feet on the ground. i'm gonna make it happen. nobody's gonna see me fall. i'm gonna make it happen. so i'll see you at the top</segment10>
		<segment11>i'm gonna make it happen    </segment11>
