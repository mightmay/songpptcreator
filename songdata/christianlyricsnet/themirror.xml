		<segment1>I looked into the mirror. Didnt know what I would see. But it was still just me. But it was still just me. With all these different images. Of who they think is me. I dont know which one to be. And my eyes look like the sea</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, what fearful times are these. I know that You dont promise this, but please. Let me feel you now. Because I know that You are here. Whispering in my ear. And looking in the mirror</segment2>
		<segment3>She woke up this morning. Didnt know who she should be. So she turned on the TV. So she could escape for free. And all this time Youve been right here. But she just couldnt see. There is more than just a dream. Shes the daughter of a King</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, what fearful times are these. I know that You dont promise this, but please. Let her feel you now. Because I know that Youre there. Hearing every prayer. And returning her stare</segment4>
		<segment5>Ive been so many people to so many people. But I just want to be who You want me to be</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh, what fearful times are these. O, Lord, you don't promise this but please. Let me feel you now. Because I know that You are here. Whispering in my ear. And looking in the mirror     </segment6>
