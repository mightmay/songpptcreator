		<segment1>vs. 1.  O Lord, the God who avenges, O God who avenges, shine forth. vs. 2. Rise up, O Judge of the earth; pay back to the proud what they deserve. vs. 3. How long will the wicked, O Lord, how long will the wicked be jubilant?. vs. 4. They pour out arrogant words; all the evil doers are full of boasting. vs. 5. They crush your people, O Lord; they oppress your inheritance. vs. 6. They slay the widow and the alien; they murder the fatherless. vs. 7. They say, The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed. vs. 8. Take heed, you senseless ones among the people; you fools, when will you become wise?. vs. 9. Does He who implanted the ear not hear? Does He who formed the eye not see?. vs. 10. Does He who disciplines nations not punish? Does He who teaches man lack knowledge?. vs. 11. The Lord knows the thoughts of man; He knows that they are futile. vs. 12. Blessed is the man You discipline, O Lord; the man You teach from your law;. vs. 13. You grant him relief from days of trouble, till a pit is dug for the wicked.</segment1>
