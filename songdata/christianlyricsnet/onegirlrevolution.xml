		<segment1>I wear a disguise. I'm just your average Jane. The super doesn't stand for model. But that doesn't mean i'm plain. If all you see is how I look. You miss the superchick within. And I christen you Titanic. Underestimate and swim. I've got the rifle. Gonna be myself </segment1>
		<segment2>I'll be everything that I want to be. I am confidence in insecurity. I am a voice yet waiting to be heard. I'll shoot the shot, bang. That you hear 'round the world. I'm a one girl revolution </segment2>
		<segment3>Some people see the revolution. But most only see the girl. I can loose my hard earned freedom. If my fear defies my world. I declare my independance from the critics and their stones. I can find my revolution. I can learn to stand alone </segment3>
		<segment4>I'll be everything that I want to be. I am confidence in insecurity. I am a voice yet waiting to be heard. I'll shoot the shot, bang. That you hear 'round the world. I'm a one girl revolution.     </segment4>
