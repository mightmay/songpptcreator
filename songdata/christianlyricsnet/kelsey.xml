		<segment1>He's held me for ransom for far too long. I don't care how much it hurts. I'll find a way to escape. Point his weapon straight at my head. The sooner you pull the trigger, the sooner I soak it all in. Take it from my steps. Take it from my words. Strip the images from my mind. Take the need to see from my eyes. I'll keep my foundation. I'll keep the tears. I'll share the bloodshed that you gave up for me. My hands have been bound for far too long. I don't care about the pain, I'll find the means of escape. Point his weapon straight at my head. The sooner you pull the trigger, the sooner I soak it all in. Take it from my steps. Take it from my words. Strip the images from my mind. Take the need to see from my eyes. Resist this torture of the millions. The downfall of an age. The fuel of our skin. The end of something beautiful.     </segment1>
