		<segment1>I'm sure you're in a lot of pain, But it's supposed to feel this way. I never did this to you. Despite the beauty we create. I just can't stand beneath your weight. I don't know what to do. I'm sure you need a helping hand. But you're stuck in sinking sand. And you're pulling me in with you. Look at the mess you drug me through. Look at the pity you pursue. I'm falling out with you</segment1>
		<segment2>Help me I'm falling out with you</segment2>
		<segment3>So make my instincts leave me be. Cause I don't want to fight or flee. But there's not much more you can take from me. Despite the pleasure we invoke. I'm so sick of being broke. Will it hurt this much when I've broken free?</segment3>
		<segment4>Well I try but I can't understand why I have to hold your hand. Every step of the way, day after day, you depend on my strength to pull you through. But I'm just as weak as you    </segment4>
