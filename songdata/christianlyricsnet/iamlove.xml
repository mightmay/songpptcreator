		<segment1>I am not passers by. I am not a white lie. I am love, I am love. I am not feeling sad. I am not quickly mad. I am love, I am love</segment1>
		<segment2>You can try to hide. You can try to run. But you'll never run far enough. This is my flesh, thi is my blood. And I am love. You can fly up high. You can dig down deep. You can flee to the west. You can flee to the east. But you can't escape what I've done. I am love</segment2>
		<segment3>I am not standing by. I am not letting go. I am not leaving you. I am love, I am love. My blood fell like rain. I did not bleed in vain. But from my vains. I am love    </segment3>
