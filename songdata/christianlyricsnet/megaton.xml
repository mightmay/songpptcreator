		<segment1>Even as Herod slaughtered the innocent. So our world is twist and bent. Our freedom to choose is what they say, but what will they say on Judgement Day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrah gave in, so our world is now deep in sin. Give us our rights is what I hear, but Hell is what they should fear. Chorus: Megaton! Won't even compare!. Megaton! To Hell's great flare!. Megaton! Won't even compare! Megaton!. To eternal nightmare!. Even as Pilot washed his hands, so it is in our land. We're not responsible for what we say, yet children are dying every day. Even as Satan tempted our Lord, so our world twists God's word. All roads are good is what they say, but Jesus said He is the way!. (Chorus). (Genesis 19, Proverb 6:16-17, Amos 1:13, Matthew 2:16, 4:1-11, 27:19-26, John 14:6, Romans 1:16-32, Jude 3-7).     </segment1>
