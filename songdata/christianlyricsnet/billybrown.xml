		<segment1>Super Star Billy Brown. Whatcha' doing to this town. Don'tcha know that everybody here. Wants to be like you</segment1>
		<segment2>All of your adoring fans. Sitting in the seats and stands. Listening to every word you say. And watching every move. Once I saw a sign that said. Billy Brown for President. It ain't easy being a star. It ain't easy to be who you are. It ain't easy but you're going far. Well, you say there's nothing to it. But somebody's gotta do it, boy</segment2>
		<segment3>Super Star Billy Brown. Stop and listen to the crowd. Everywhere you go. Everybody's screaming out your name</segment3>
		<segment4>Do they know the reason why. You point your finger to the sky</segment4>
		<segment5>We all are watching and expect. That whatever you are doing next. Well, it is gonna be the greatest thing. That we have ever seen    </segment5>
