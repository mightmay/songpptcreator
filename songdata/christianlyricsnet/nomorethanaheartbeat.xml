		<segment1>Carry my world. In Your nail-scarred hands, Breathing Your hope. And Your life in me.</segment1>
		<segment2>No more than a heartbeat away, No more than a heartbeat away. Whereever I go, I know that You're there, No more than a heartbeat away.</segment2>
		<segment3>Closer than my dreams, Lord, I know You. You're near me, You're near me. Your everlasting arms, They surround me. You hold me, You hold me.</segment3>
		<segment4>Every word I pray, Lord, You listen, My Savior, You heard me, Watching over me. Every moment. You keep me, You keep me.</segment4>
		<segment5>(BRIDGE). You'll never leave me. Without You. You'll never leave me alone.You'll never leave me. Without You, &quot;Cause I know. You'll always be there.    </segment5>
