		<segment1>You are high over all nations. Your glory shines above the heavens. Humbled Yourself to love and save us. Be praised through endless generations </segment1>
		<segment2>There's no one like our God, no one at all. Gave His Son for us, Jesus the Lord. Who can love us like He does, no one at all </segment2>
		<segment3>O how we love You Lord. You lift the needy from the ashes. And seat them high up with the princes. You give the broken hearted healing. Trading our scars for Your beauty and freedom.     </segment3>
