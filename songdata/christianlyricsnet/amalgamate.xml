		<segment1>You've got a cause now, I heard you braggin'. Always the fastest one on the bandwagon. So sit down and I'll tell you, what I'm feeling, what I am feeling. For a lack of better words you are stealing, you are stealing, all of my joy away from me. What ever happened to our unity? </segment1>
		<segment2>We cut ourselves, our own limbs we've severed. It's time for us to pull together and stand, as one. All eyes are turning towards the Son. Drop your fists now, what you resent. Let's not forget who we represent. And fall to our knees in unity.</segment2>
		<segment3>Another day now, another doctrine, another monkey wrench in the system. Some folks kneelin', some just listen, some fallin' out of the pews from twistin'. I don't care kinds, how you do it. United we'll stand and we'll pull through it. All were dead once. All enslaved. Now pull together 'cause we've all been saved. </segment3>
		<segment4>The only Jesus this world's gonna see, is the Jesus in you and me. So pick your cross up, stop your swingin'. Stop and look at the stink you're bringin' to this body with your fighting, you bust more more knuckles that the wrongs your righting. What's important, is where we relate, it's the meaning of the word Amalagate.    </segment4>
