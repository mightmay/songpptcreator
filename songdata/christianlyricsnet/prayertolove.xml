		<segment1>Prayer to Love</segment1>
		<segment2>When I'm in trouble, You rescue me. . When I'm alone in my soul, You're here with me. Always unconditional, when I need a friend. You hold me and  You're strong, but gentle enough to bend. You know my name when I call, You don't forget me when I fall. You're my anchor, You're my wings. And I know you're listening.  Yeah</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: . Love save me, oh Lord make me. A reflection of Your love.  Capture me, don't set me free. Surround me by Your love..  Love, Love, Love</segment3>
		<segment4>Let me see through Your eyes, touch me with grace. When you color my world, it's such a beautiful place. I put all my faith in You, Ill go where you want me to. You'll be there with open arms, when I have a fragile heart.  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah  </segment4>
		<segment5>Repeat 1st Chorus Above</segment5>
		<segment6>2nd Chorus: The closer I am to You Lord, The nearer I am to Love. Place the path to You, before me, Keep Your hand above. This is my prayer to</segment6>
