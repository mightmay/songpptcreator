		<segment1>I stalked serenity with blind obsession. and found possession as I lost control. The secret vice that proclaimed my freedom. is now a slavery thats all my own</segment1>
		<segment2>My Own. My Own. My Own</segment2>
		<segment3>Im powerless to this voice. Ill never prevail alone</segment3>
		<segment4>Desperate. We will proclaim. That on our knees. Were not ashamed. So we bow it to. bow it to. Kneel before you. Just like a child here Im not ashamed. No, were not ashamed</segment4>
		<segment5>And so in urgency we now concede. That we are helpless in this undertow. Cause in surrender now there just might be. a new serenity thats all my own    </segment5>
