		<segment1>Forty days with a heart like a stone. Forty nights feeling cold and alone. Like a stranger cause its been so long. Its not You but its me whos gone</segment1>
		<segment2>Try to pray bow my head but life gets in the way. And I dont even know what to say</segment2>
		<segment3>Somewhere in the middle You still shine in me. Somewhere in the middle of Your hands. Somewhere in the middle of Your plans. You make me complete    </segment3>
