		<segment1>You mercy taught us how to dance. To celebrate with all we have. And we'll dance to thank You for mercy</segment1>
		<segment2>Your glory taught us how to shout. To lift Your name in all the earth. And we'll shout to the praise of Your glory</segment2>
		<segment3>It's the overflow. Of a forgiven soul. And now we've seen You, God. Our hearts cannot stay silent</segment3>
		<segment4>And we'll be a dancing generation. Dancing because of Your great mercy, Lord. Your great mercy, Lord. And we'll be a shouting generation. Shouting because of Your great glory, Lord. Your great glory, Lord     </segment4>
