		<segment1>Have you seen the cavern walls?. It's menaced allocated. I have seen the future. It's never bright, it's like a glimmering snake. Down, down, down. Where are the stirrings of old?. I knew you had to last. Lead us to Neptuenn. We deserve worse!. We know it's the last who drown at their birth. Have you just lost your own mind, under pretty lights?. As the workers till the land. They find the Cresol is safe. As they move their hands out. Reaching out, panic has pressed to the nerves. Down, down, down. Slip from a beautiful grace. To the floor of fangs!. Lead us to Neptuenn. We deserve worse!. We know it's the last who drown at their birth. Have you just lost your own mind, under pretty lights?. Turn the key and dance to the walls. Turn the key and dance to the walls. Down, down, down. Where are the stirrings of old?. Have you just lost your own mind, under pretty lights?. And with a great spray of light, you doubt.    </segment1>
