		<segment1>If you got a dream, go chase it. If you got a fear, then face it. Got a lot of life, don't waste it. Sitting on your hands. While the sky if falling. Every single day that's dawning. Is another perfect morning. Got a lot to do, stop yawning. Listen up, the world is calling. You know you want to make a difference. Break the silence. On your feet</segment1>
		<segment2>People get up. If you wanna be lifted up. If you wanna be looking up. Do you wanna be ready. To take a stand, put your hand up. If you wanna be waken up. Do you wanna be shaken up If you wanna be right on the money. Everybody get up</segment2>
		<segment3>Every little thing you're doing. Every little plan you're brewing. Everything you're going through. Gonna make you stronger. Just remember. If you ever trip and stumble. If you ever roll and tumble. If you ever fall and fumble. Dust it off, and get back into the moment. And make a difference. Break the silence. On your feet</segment3>
		<segment4>When you're feeling down. Take a look around. Put your hands up, Put your hands up. When you're feeling low. All you need to know. Put your hands up, Put your hands up. Whatcha goin' through, Whatcha gonna do. Put your hands up, Put your hands up. So if you've got the faith. Let me hear you say. Na Na Na    </segment4>
