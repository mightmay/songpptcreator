		<segment1>Broken words said to me. These broken mirrors make it hard to see. Does anyone feel the same?. I need some help, I need some change. Broken dreams and broken hearts. You broke my trust right from the start. How am I supposed to feel. When nothing's ever real?</segment1>
		<segment2>If you want me try to take me. On the inside, just like a racecar</segment2>
		<segment3>Carry on, but daddy's gone. Tell me what did I do wrong. I need your help cause I don't know. Take it slow, Look out below</segment3>
		<segment4>And I'm traveling past the ever-growing graffiti on the over-pass. I wave to everybody while I fly on past. Cause this racecar was built to last</segment4>
		<segment5>If you want me try to take me. On the inside, just like a racecar. Cut the corners if you'd like to. Take me away. I want to but I can't let go</segment5>
		<segment6>It's six in the morning here. I lay awake I'm waiting for my mind to clear up. So I can rewind and just count myself to sleep. And everyday I want to climb to a new height. My life is like the making of a long ride. I started the ignition such a ling time ago</segment6>
		<segment7>If you want me try to take me. On the inside, just like a racecar. Cut the corners if you'd like to. Take me away. I want to but I can't let go</segment7>
		<segment8>I'll let you drive, I'll let you drive. I'll let you drive, I'll let you take me away.     </segment8>
