		<segment1>forget the politics and all the hypocrites. you know the body's sick from religion, indecision, mediocrity</segment1>
		<segment2>you think you're too young. you say you're too dumb. wait 'til tomorrow comes. but today is the day you've got to show the way</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). I say hey, now, now - we're callin' you out. never back down - no fear, no doubt. hey now, now - you can show us how. you better get up 'cause we're callin' all church punks</segment3>
		<segment4>this is a call for a truth rebellion. to all the people who hear, this is a call. to make a stand, throw your fists up in the air. (yeah) make up your mind - now is the time</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus).     </segment5>
