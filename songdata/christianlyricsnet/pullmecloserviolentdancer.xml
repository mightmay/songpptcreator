		<segment1>I've got a monster to tame. It looks alot like your face. I said to let go of all your inhibitions with me. We'll make all our worries disappear with our feet</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't worry. Don't worry. Come with me. Come with me. And move now. Slowly. Slowly. Sweat it out. Sweat it out</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't stop pulling me closer. I love it when you let me fall to your hands. My favorite thing is when you don't stop dancing</segment3>
		<segment4>I've got a monster to please. It says to dance with me. Pppplease violent dancer drag yourself to the floor. And don't stop swinging till we break down the doors</segment4>
		<segment5>And swing now. Swing now. Twist around. Twist around. And move now. Further. Further. Sweat it out. Sweat it out    </segment5>
