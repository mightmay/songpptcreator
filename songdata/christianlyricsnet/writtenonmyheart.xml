		<segment1>Thinking how it might have been. If you had never. Walked into my life. I would have been nothing. Without you where would I be</segment1>
		<segment2>Every moment used to feel. Like living through a. Cold and starless night. But everything's changing. Everything is feeling right</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: You gave me your love. Lifted me up. Now I'm looking at forever. When I never thought. I'd ever see that far. You, you're in my soul. Wherever I go. Now I know right from the start. Your love was. Written on my heart</segment3>
		<segment4>How could I have been so blind. When you were always here. So near to me. And there is no other. Who knows me the way. I feel you do</segment4>
		<segment5>And you were waiting all the time. For me to come around. And finally see. All the love I was missing. There you were right beside me. Always beside me</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>You made it so easy. Your love brought out. The best in me. You are my light and my truth. I've found my destiny in you</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)</segment8>
		<segment9>You're forever. Written on my heart    </segment9>
