		<segment1>Three feet tall and full of questions. You must have thought I was the smartest man alive. I didn't always have the answers. To every little how and where and why </segment1>
		<segment2>Like Daddy, why's the sky so blue today?. Does Jesus really hear me when I pray?. When I grow up, will I be just like you?. Will I be tall and strong and brave?</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS(1): There is no power on earth like your fathers' love. So big and so strong as your father's love. A promise that's sacred, a promise from heaven above. No matter where you go.. always know. You can depend on your father's love </segment3>
		<segment4>Especially when it's cold, especially when you're lonely. When your little heart is lost trying to find it's way. I know the world is always changing. But, remember son, that some things never change </segment4>
		<segment5>And even when my life on earth is through. There will still be a part of me in you. 'Cause some things are forever. Nothing's ever gonna take my love from you </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS(2): There is no power on earth like your father's love. So big and so strong as your father's love. A promise that's sacred, a promise from heaven above. Did I hug enough, did I care enough. When you most needed me, Was I there enough. Enough to make you feel the power of. Your father's love    </segment6>
