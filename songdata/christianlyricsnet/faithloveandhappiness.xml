		<segment1>Everyone is up in my face. Need to get outta this place. It's hard to see with you in front of my face. Just another perfect day. Acting like they wanna talk to me. So fake, yet so friendly. My eyes can see even the back of me. Won't you just let me be </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. 'Cause everyone is falling away. Feel like they're stolen from me. Wish everything didn't happen to me. All I want is faith, love and happiness. Everytime one runs away. Another one's returning. Wish everyone could just see you face. Faith, love and happiness </segment2>
		<segment3>It seems everyone is up in my space. Like it's the American way. I run in case somebody takes my place. Just another change of pace. I know you think you know a lot about me. But so many wanna doubt me. My eyes can see even the back of me. Won't you just let me be </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS </segment4>
		<segment5>Every which way I turn. I've got the option of a million choices. Every single word I say. Is judged by a million critics. Every which way you turn. You've got the sound of a million voices. Every single move you make. Is torn by a million cynics. When will we all see the light of day?. I don't know </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS     </segment6>
