		<segment1>A little says a lot. when writing from across the world. under the cover of the air. open your letterbox. each day to catch a glimpse of me. someone who's trying just to breathe</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't ask my love. where is that your peace comes from</segment2>
		<segment3>I found it in a disappearing world. I found it in a disappearing world</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm running out of time. to make a sentimental plea. pass off this trivial affair. that made me motion sick. to be displaced in history. and separated by a scare</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't ask my love. where is that your peace comes from</segment5>
		<segment6>I found it in a disappearing world. I found it in the beauty of the world</segment6>
		<segment7>his intentions were not. as clear as they could be. who's reflection was not. made to look like me. and who's intentions were not. as clear as they could be. who's reflection was not. made to look like me</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm running out of time. to make a sentimental plea</segment8>
		<segment9>Don't ask my love. where is that your peace comes from</segment9>
