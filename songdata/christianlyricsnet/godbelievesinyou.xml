		<segment1>When you start to doubt if you exist. God believes in you. Confounded by the evidence. God believes in you. When your light burns to dim. And when your changes seem so slim. And you swear you dont believe in Him. God believes in you</segment1>
		<segment2>When you rise up just to fall again. God believes in you. Deserted by your closest friends. God believes in you. And when youre betrayed with a kiss. And you turn your cheek to another fist. It does not have to end like this. Cause God believes in you</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh everything matters if anything matters at all. Everything matters, no matter how big, No matter how small. Cause God believes in you. Oh God believes in you</segment3>
		<segment4>When youre so ashamed that you could die. God believes in you. And you cant do right even thought you try. God believes in you</segment4>
		<segment5>Blessed are the ones who grieve. The ones who mourn and the ones who bleed. In sorrow you sow but in joy youll reap. God believes in you. Yea blessed  </segment5>
		<segment6>Oh everything matters if anything matters at all. Everything matters, no matter how big, No matter how small. Cause God believes in you. Oh God believes in you    </segment6>
