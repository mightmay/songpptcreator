		<segment1>What have I to offer to a world in need?. Yet, for some unknown reason, you have chosen me. Lord, you've set my journey, you've prepared the way. Still, I'm desp'rate for the words to say, and. 'all I am is willing; all I have is in your hands.'</segment1>
		<segment2>Speak for me; this my plea. Say the words I can't express. Sing for me a heavenly melody. That the people will be blessed. Speak for me.</segment2>
		<segment3>Ev'ry brief encounter that you send my way. Is a chance to show the love you gave me. I see their troubled faces, a hunger deep inside. But I depend on you to touch their lives. Light what burns within me, let. your truth shine through my life.</segment3>
		<segment4>Speak for me; this my plea. Say the words I can't express. Sing for me a heavenly melody. That the people will be blessed. Speak for me.</segment4>
		<segment5>Sing for me, set me free, They will see your holiness. Speak for me. 'cause your love will lead them on to heaven's gate. Where they can look upon your face. Light what burns within me, let. your truth shine through my life.</segment5>
		<segment6>(speak for me; this my plea. Say the words I can't express.). Oh, this is my plea. (sing for me) a heavenly melody. That the people will be blessed. Speak for me.</segment6>
		<segment7>Sing for me, set me free, And they will see your holiness. Speak for me, sing for me, speak for me. You're all I have to offer to a world in need. oh..    </segment7>
