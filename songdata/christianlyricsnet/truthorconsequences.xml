		<segment1>The TV said just make sure youre old enough. And let your feelings tell you when its right. What went wrong? She thought it was really love. Now she wonders why she just cant sleep at night. She knew the rules but they were too old fashioned. Was it worth the price she has to pay</segment1>
		<segment2>Its either truth or consequences, theres no other way. Push truth aside, the other takes its place. Well, you can close your eyes but that wont make it go away. The truth or consequences must be faced</segment2>
		<segment3>The headlines say our worlds in a lot of pain. Hurt from all the selfishness and greed. What went wrong? Like sheep all have gone astray. Well reap what we sow, dont be deceived. His truths been given and its there before us. Written on the page and in our hearts</segment3>
		<segment4>Its either truth or consequences, theres no other way. Push truth aside, the other takes its place. Well, you can close your eyes but that wont make it go away. The truth or consequences must be faced</segment4>
		<segment5>As sure as God made the sun to shine. He made the rules we must all live by. He loved us too much to leave us alone. To our own devices</segment5>
		<segment6>Its either truth or consequences, theres no other way. Push truth aside, the other takes its place. Well, you can close your eyes but that wont make it go away. The truth or consequences must be faced </segment6>
