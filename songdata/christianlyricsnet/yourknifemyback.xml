		<segment1>Your words are shallow and dull against my skin. Their cold bitter edge cuts deeper within. I don't appreciate the words you say behind my back, but it's OK. I'm not one for getting mad. I don't need apologies. I don't fall for sympathy. You can't win me back. This will be the last time I'm kissing you good-bye. You left me with a scar across my back. These stones are breaking my bones as they crush me. Your careless remarks left me here to bleed. I don't appreciate the games you play without regret but it's OK. I'm not one for getting mad. Your knife, my back     </segment1>
