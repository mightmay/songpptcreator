		<segment1>Sitting alone, in the rain, one day you came and sat by me. When I looked up, you just smiled and said hello and I saw your pretty face. I never knew what it would be. I never knew you'd care for me. When I think of how it's changed, for better or worse, we'll have to see. All those times you looked at me that way. And I know everything will be o.k. Thinking of your smile, it hurts to see you cry. Al those times that you were sad, you never told me why. I know that we are still growing, not knowing what's to come. But only god knows what he has in store for us.    </segment1>
