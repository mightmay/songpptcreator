		<segment1>To all who are tortured and ravaged by sin. The frail and the wounded about to give in. There's news of release and captivity's end. We've been set free, come and see. Oh sleeper awake, come out of the night. Throw open the door and step into the light. For sin is undone and the wrong is made light. We've been set free, come and see</segment1>
		<segment2>Come and see, the power of sin has been broken. The gates of your prisons stand open, come and see. Arise, believe, for the power at work both to rescue and save. Is the power that raised Jesus Christ from the grave. We've been set free, come and see</segment2>
		<segment3>I, too, lived in slavery, unmercifully bound. Battered and broken I finally knelt down. And there in obedience freedom was found, I've been set free. And now through the dungeons of darkness and night. I run in the freedom of liberty's light. And shout to the captives, &quot;Oh prisoner take flight. We've been set free, come and see&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>If the enemy's holding a knife to your chest. Demanding you give up or die. In Christ crucified you've already died. And now you are free</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
