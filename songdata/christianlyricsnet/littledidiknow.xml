		<segment1>I had an angel that sat on my shoulder, seems like everybody's got one, I had the devil waiting on standby, for when I wanted to have some fun. thought that I was living forever, I thought that my smile would get me in, never felt the wind that was coming, never thought the party would end. no, no, no, no.. </segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. little did I know. that you were all I needed. little did I see. until you opened up my eyes. little did I know. that one prayer could reach you. little did I know. that you even cared </segment2>
		<segment3>I had my daddy wrapped 'round my finger. I never made my momma cry. nothin but smiles on the outside. but all the while living a lie. If you ask me am I going to heaven, I said you know I've been a good good girl. I'm gonna spend all my money on makeup. and a find a boy who will buy me the world </segment3>
		<segment4>[chorus] </segment4>
		<segment5>little did I know. that you loved me before I even met you. I didn't see beyond myself. but I couldn't fight forever. because you are so easy to trust. and now we play together. my life has just begun </segment5>
		<segment6>[chorus x2]    </segment6>
