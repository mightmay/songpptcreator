		<segment1>would you have noticed if i swam away. did i make you think twice about letting me in. maybe if you'd hold me one more time. one more time. i can't tell you anything that is not a lie</segment1>
		<segment2>the changing times. the fading lines. will you carry me. a fortress falls. a lady calls. will you marry me</segment2>
		<segment3>shot down your advice about the world. but i didn't listen when you hated me. it took me ages just to come to this. if you wanted to kill me. you could've done it with a kiss. with a kiss</segment3>
		<segment4>the changing times. the fading lines. will you carry me. a fortress falls. a lady calls. will you marry me</segment4>
		<segment5>since you went sour. i've been wondering how the rest will fall to place. but i didn't notice. how you undertook this burden of disgrace</segment5>
		<segment6>the changing times. the fading lines. will you carry me. a fortress falls. a lady calls. will you marry me</segment6>
		<segment7>the changing times. the fading lines. will you carry me. a fortress falls. a lady calls. will you marry me. marry me. marry me. merry me    </segment7>
