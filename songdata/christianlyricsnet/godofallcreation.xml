		<segment1>I'm totally abandoned to You. I'm lost inside the rivers of Your love. I'm swept into the power of Your presence. Drawn toward the whisper of Your voice</segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 2. I come to You in quiet adoration. And fall before Your feet You are my King. I'm living for the beauty of Your Presence. To behold the glory of Your face</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Holy, Worthy, is the Lord. Heaven declares Your Rightousness. Oh God of All Creation. I worship You</segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2. CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh when You said 'seek Your face'. My heart said 'Your face I will seek' (2x)    </segment5>
