		<segment1>Hanging by a thread. From the tree. of this life. I've been spinning. round and round and round. Inside my flesh cocoon. An old beat up Pinto. might be what I drive for now. But I'll be driving a Cadillac soon</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause you know one day I will fly. To my mansion in the sky. And I'll have no regrets. when I leave this place. for good. When I say my last farewell. oh, please don't forget to tell them. That I'm not really dead. I'm just changing neighborhoods</segment2>
		<segment3>Living in this place. that is only temporary. I said that this old world. is in the process of slipping away. Though I have such a future. I've got to be wary. That my bright tomorrow doesn't blind me. to what God has for me today</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause you know one day I will fly. To my mansion in the sky. And I'll have no regrets. when I leave this place. for good. When I say my last farewell. oh, please don't forget to tell them. That I'm not really dead. I'm just changing neighborhoods</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause you know one day I will fly. To my mansion in the sky. And I'll have no regrets. when I leave this place. for good. When I say my last farewell. oh, please don't forget to tell them. That I'm not really dead. I'm just changing neighborhoods    </segment5>
