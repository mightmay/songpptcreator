		<segment1>Have you ever had a day that was so bad. It took everything you had to make it through the night. Have you ever had a week that brought you to your knees. It made it hard to pray - but you did anyway</segment1>
		<segment2>Holla - does anybody hear me. Holla - I wonder can you feel me. You must be tried in the fire before gold. Holla - had anybody had to cry. Holla - Do you really want to testify. Is that fire burning down in your soul</segment2>
		<segment3>Hop, skip, jump do whatever you do. Never let life get the best of you. To all of y'all with your back up on the wall. do your left step right when you do your move. Let your body feel this boom. Shabacha laca la ohhhhh. shabacha laca la</segment3>
		<segment4>Let everything that have breath just praise him. Like Psalms 150:6. Have you ever totally let yourself be free. To the One who gave you life abundantly</segment4>
		<segment5>chorus    </segment5>
