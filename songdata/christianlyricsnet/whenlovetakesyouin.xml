		<segment1>I know youve heard the stories. But they all sound too good to be true. Youve heard about a place called home. But there doesnt seem to be one for you. So one more night you cry yourself to sleep. And drift off to a distant dream</segment1>
		<segment2>Where love takes you in and everything changes. A miracle starts with the beat of a heart. When love takes you home and says you belong here. The loneliness ends and a new life begins. When love takes you in</segment2>
		<segment3>And somewhere while youre sleeping. Someone else is dreaming too. Counting down the days until. They hold you close and say I love you. And like the rain that falls into the sea. In a moment what has been is lost in what will be</segment3>
		<segment4>When love takes you in everything changes. A miracle starts with the beat of a heart</segment4>
		<segment5>And this love will never let you go. There is nothing that could ever cause this love to lose its hold</segment5>
		<segment6>When love takes you in everything changes. A miracle starts with the beat of a heart. When love takes you home and says you belong here. The loneliness ends and a new life begins. When love takes you in it takes you in for good. When love takes you in </segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
