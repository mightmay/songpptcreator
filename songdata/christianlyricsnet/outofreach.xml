		<segment1>No more words to sing. No more contradicting melody. No more cheap goodbye. No more golden lie</segment1>
		<segment2>Nothing to defend. Eyes, it's time to learn to cry again. Drawing out this line. For the millionth time</segment2>
		<segment3>Behind me I see. A broken world and. Dead end dreams</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm out of reach. I'm out of the reach of yesterday. Fade away. And I have changed. I have changed, so on with today </segment4>
		<segment5>Following my heart. No where but the honest truth to start. What have I become?. What could I become?</segment5>
		<segment6>Failure or success. Welcoming the test to prove my love. Growing in my faith. Lord please grant the strength </segment6>
		<segment7>Behind me I see. A broken world and. Dead end dreams</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm out of reach. I'm out of the reach of yesterday. Fade away. And I have changed. I have changed, so on with today</segment8>
		<segment9>Thankfully, I'm breaking free. From all the chains that are holding me. I never knew how good life could be. So this is peace</segment9>
		<segment10>I'm out of reach. I'm out of the reach of yesterday. Fade away. And I have changed. I have changed, so on with today</segment10>
		<segment11>I'm out of reach. I'm out of the reach of yesterday. Fade away. And I see life. I see life. Ahead. Not behind.     </segment11>
