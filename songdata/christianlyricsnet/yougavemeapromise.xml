		<segment1>The waves are crashing down on me. But I know that this cannot be the end, be the end.. Right now I feel like copping out. Will You hold me up, if I just say. That I will stay</segment1>
		<segment2>I will hold on to this hope that I have. You gave me a promise. You gave me a promise. I'll push through this moment, I'll never give up. You gave me a promise. You gave me a promise. I'm so tired that I can't stand</segment2>
		<segment3>But I know that time will heal this heart, heal this heart..</segment3>
		<segment4>With every door that's slamming shut. A new one's there to lead me where You are</segment4>
		<segment5>You, You call out to me. You're just out of reach. But I'm closing in. I'm still going, still believing in Your word    </segment5>
