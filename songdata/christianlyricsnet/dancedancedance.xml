		<segment1>Maybe you don't understand why I gotta dance. There was something had me down but it's over now. I'ma throw my hands up. Wave em all in the air. Cause all I wanna do is dance, dance, dance</segment1>
		<segment2>They told me you ain't good enough. Don't look good enough. Don't sing good enough. Maybe you should give it up. And if I would've then I never could've received. None of the things that He planned for me. So I waited a little longer. Grew a little stronger and then. I realized something was happening. It's so incredible, it's unexplainable. You oughta try Him for yourself and see because</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>Sometimes I think about. How it used to be, and can't help but. Remembering how it was never easy for me, no, no. But the way God works, it's so amazing. He never forgot me, I can't forget Him. That's enough for me to lift my hands and. I'm sorry if you don't understand </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>All my tears (it's over now). And all my pain (it's over now). All my doubts (it's over now). They went away (it's over now). No more fear (it's over now). And I'm glad (it's over now). Yes, so glad. Cause all I wanna do is dance</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus</segment7>
		<segment8>. (Psalm 30:11-12, Psalm 150).     </segment8>
