		<segment1>Follow the crowd and love everybody now. 'Cause love is the best thing for you now. But you changed your mind, you let everybody down. But down is the best place for you. It's easier that way, you know it's </segment1>
		<segment2>So wrong, can't embrace it. wish sometimes for any other you. But you can't erase it, and you won't escape it </segment2>
		<segment3>Don't waste your time. Your words only confine you. To all of the things you've buried now. Don't ask them why. Their wisdom will leave you blind. But blind is the best thing for you. It's easier I know, you know it's </segment3>
		<segment4>So wrong, can't embrace it. Wish sometimes for any other you. But you can't erase it, and you won't escape it </segment4>
		<segment5>How long will you face it. Till the wait comes crashing down on you. 'Cause you can't erase it, and you won't escape it     </segment5>
