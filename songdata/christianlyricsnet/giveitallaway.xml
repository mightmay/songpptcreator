		<segment1>Search my heart, search my mind, search my soul. Make me clean, make me new make me whole</segment1>
		<segment2>All of my plans, all of my dreams, I lay them down before Your feet. All of my time, all that was mine, I now submit to Your design. 'Cause You are the one who can make my life complete. You are the one who can give light to my feet. You are the one and only one who dared to give it all away for me</segment2>
		<segment3>You are my strength, You are my God, you are my King. You make me laugh, You make me dance, You make me sing</segment3>
		<segment4>Everything inside, everything outside, I give it all away. You never change, but You rearrange my heart more everyday.     </segment4>
