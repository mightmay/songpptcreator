		<segment1>Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Lean not on your own understanding. In all of your ways acknowledge Him. And He will make your paths straight. Don't worry about about tomorrow. He's got it under control. Just trust in the Lord with all of your heart. And He will carry you through</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, sometimes it gets so tough. To keep my eyes on You. When things are going rough. But then I turn my eyes up to the sky. And I hear Your voice it says to me</segment2>
		<segment3>You have much trouble in this world. I have overcome    </segment3>
