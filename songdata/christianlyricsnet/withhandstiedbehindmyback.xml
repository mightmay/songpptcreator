		<segment1>It? not getting later, there? no common place, and everything? taken. With these expectations, of getting this right, who could avoid failure. With hands tied behind my back, I stand helpless waiting. Confined to this breaking point, I don? stand alone. How have I forgotten, the source of control, my first inspiration. When trying to take on, this life obstacle, I need to remember.    </segment1>
