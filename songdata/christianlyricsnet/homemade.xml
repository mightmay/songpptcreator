		<segment1>Riding the city bus. On the way to school. Me and my two sisters. And all the ridicule. The older girls on the back of the bus. Would laugh and call us names. They'd talk about our hair, our clothes. And call us homemade</segment1>
		<segment2>See the not-so-good old days could make you. Weak or make you brave</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. And I've never been. The most beautiful. No, I ain't never been. The most popular. But it's amazing what. Love can do. It's amazing what. A little love can do</segment3>
		<segment4>Every thought and action. Is like a boomerang. What goes around will come back, baby. So careful what you say. And the little ugly ducklings. Are swans that got away. 'Cause Cinderella stories, They still happen every day</segment4>
		<segment5>Well, the not-so-good old days could make you. Weak or make you brave</segment5>
		<segment6>[Repeat Chorus]</segment6>
		<segment7>See I bumped into a stanger. Just the other day. She said, &quot;Can you spare a dollar, sista?. My man, he ain't got paid.&quot;. And so I gave her what I had. Then I recognized her face. She was the leader of the girls who used to. Call us homemade</segment7>
		<segment8>Back when the not-so-good old days could make you. Weak or make you brave. And then I told her. .</segment8>
		<segment9>See I have never been (never been). The most beautiful. And don't really care that I ain't never been (never been). The most popular. 'Cause it's amazing what. Love will do. Now hang on, it's amazing what. Homemade love, what homemade love will do</segment9>
		<segment10>Yeah. . Mama said, &quot;This is what homemade love would do&quot;. .    </segment10>
