		<segment1>a palm tree. a royal guard. of tropical oceans and beaches. looks down upon the grains of sand. like an emperor. look on his empire. brand new wave throws me back and forth. and tends to grip me. as the metallic dolphin. carefully darts out of any obstacle. that might be in her way. the red sun breathes life into all creation. under these palm trees. i can't find the air. wonder if you can or ever will.     </segment1>
