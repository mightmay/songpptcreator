		<segment1>The sun wouldn't look my way, Only darkness, I felt alone yet safe with you, I felt the promise to be true, Swollen teardrops drowned, The wind was blowing down. I felt His presence all around, A voice came through black thunder clouds, Tell me you're scared.</segment1>
		<segment2>The rain kept drumming fast, (Such guilt). The devil tried to make it last, But to no avail. I prayed and cried that night, I hope that God can make this right, Just like He always did, I know I am Your son, My life has only just begun, To praise Your Holy Name, We praise Your Holy Name,</segment2>
		<segment3>Now, not alone, This can be made alright. You know my life, I'll give it back to You, I know we are Your sons, We know are lives have just begun, To let the world know where we stand, We stand with You. Dogwood Mycro    </segment3>
