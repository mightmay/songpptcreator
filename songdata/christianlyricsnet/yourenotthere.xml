		<segment1>Why do I think of you. Far beyond my reach. Why can't I comprehend. The love you have for me. God of all the universe. Of earth and sky and sea. Your desire to own my heart. Is such a mystery</segment1>
		<segment2>Chours: You're not there. Way out there. Wandering in your great unknown. You are here ever near. In my heart you've found a home. You are living. You are breathing. I can feel your presence in me</segment2>
		<segment3>All the prayers to the saints. Every votive burned. But now I know from within. Your loving voice is heard</segment3>
		<segment4>You sent your spirit. The promised one. To be with me forever</segment4>
		<segment5>(Repeat Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>You are living. You are breathing. You are loving. I am needing    </segment6>
