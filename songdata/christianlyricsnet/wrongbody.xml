		<segment1>If I make it to heaven. I may be as bloody as hell. Would you still take me?. I'm afraid that you might say, &quot;Depart from me, I never knew you.&quot; </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm in the wrong body. I'm in the wrong body. I'm in the wrong body. I must have stumbled in. </segment2>
		<segment3>All the love I want to give, Gets caught between every rib. What does that make me?. I have good intentions, But no exit for them to come out right through. </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm in the wrong body. I'm in the wrong body. I'm in the wrong body. I must have stumbled in.     </segment4>
