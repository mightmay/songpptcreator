		<segment1>She is the enchantment. She is the filth that you love to crawl in. You're forced to feed on the dirt that you can only perceive as passion. But looks are deceiving. Beauty is only skin deep. She's put an end to existance. She's put an end to us all. THere's something in her eyes that says, &quot;I'am here to tell you lies.&quot;. Meet her stare to entrap yourself in the place where love has died. Beware the Blossom. Beware of her eyes. Run. You'll never make it out of here alive. Run. You'll never make it out. But looks are deceiving. Beauty is only skin deep. She's put an end to existance. She's put an end to us all. Beware.     </segment1>
