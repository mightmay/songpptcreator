		<segment1>Endless streets of black. Leading nowhere it seems. Lessons from being trapped. Inside a dream</segment1>
		<segment2>For some it's play. Many choose to walk away</segment2>
		<segment3>Can somebody tell me. What am I doing here?. I need to know if. It's all been a waste of time?</segment3>
		<segment4>I hope we make it. I hope we will survive. These are the questions. Running through my mind</segment4>
		<segment5>Scarring our skin with the. Color blue. I don't know if I can go on. Without you</segment5>
		<segment6>For some it's play. Many choose to walk away. From the demons pulling you in. Blinded by the light you can't defend</segment6>
		<segment7>Forest brown with fields of red. Remembering all the things we did. Bridges always join us together. I wish this time could last forever    </segment7>
