		<segment1>I cry why o' why did my mommy have to die.. too many questions, no answers. confuses my mind. Like what did I do, what did she do. Who's to blame. No one understands what I'm going through, so how can I trust what I can't touch. and can't see. Believe in love and she's in front of me. Silence your eyes, my heart so cold, no time for goodbyes, then you leave me alone. So what do I do, except it and carry on. or release my anger, until it's gone. show you and this world what exactly how I feel. death in full color, it's never been so real, it's been me and you, it's always been me and you, no matter what we faced, we always made through. Get outta that dream, do what I gotta do. No one can take Your place and I don't want them to. if I could take your place, I would, I would take your pain just to see you smile. and say my name. just to see you laugh. and hear you cry. I don't understand, I don't know why. I've never been in this state of mind, life don't make sense. With you I can move mountains, right now I'm helpless I guess, you always knew what was best. Believed in your God, till the very last breath you showed me, how strong you can be if Jesus saved your life, could He do it for me. I'll lay down my life, for you and for him believe in God's promise. I'm gonna see you again. Lord here I am, but I am no one. Believe in your name, believe in your son. if you meet me here, I will wait on you. Sacrifice and serve, do you want me to. I'll take it day by day, and sit at your feet. You are strong and I am weak. I'll seek, to keep from going under until I hold you again, I'll always wonder. Why did my mommy have to die. (repeats)    </segment1>
