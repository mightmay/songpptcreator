		<segment1>You're not who they say you are. They made you the enemy. (CHRIST-Jah flesh; CHRIST-Light within; CHRIST- Beginning and the end). Taken something so beautiful. Painted a new picture that makes me sick. (CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and the last). Feed our minds confusion. Sweeten the taste of pollution. (CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Resurrect; CHRIST-Everlasting Jah) </segment1>
		<segment2>chorus: Some people call you father. Maybe you could set me free. These people hate each other. But you've always been there for me </segment2>
		<segment3>I refuse to be like you. Without life, caving in. (CHRIST-Jah flesh; CHRIST-Light within; CHRIST- Beginning and the end). I surrender, giving up all that is me. Yielding to you. (CHRIST-Witness; CHRIST-Living one; CHRIST-First and the last). Shape me in my brokeness. Empower me forever. (CHRIST-Word life; CHRIST-Resurrect; CHRIST-Everlasting Jah) </segment3>
		<segment4>chorus </segment4>
		<segment5>outro: I know you will complete this work started in me. I need you more than ever now that I know who you are. I know you will complete this work started in me. I need you more than ever now that I've come so far</segment5>
