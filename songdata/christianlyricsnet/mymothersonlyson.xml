		<segment1>Talks about it all the time. It's a sickness he says. So sure all the time. He hates it. And I honestly believe him. So sure all the time</segment1>
		<segment2>Maybe the one who screams the most. Screams about himself</segment2>
		<segment3>Fed up of giving up. Clean cup please drink up</segment3>
		<segment4>He sees it's eating him up. It's the price he pays. But it's not even worth a dime. So scared that people may find out. He is what he hates. So scared all the time</segment4>
		<segment5>This is his naked inside</segment5>
		<segment6>Piece by piece he's trying to build a ladder. For him to fall from. Every time he climbs. He condemns their actions. So that no one will suspect. That he's the victim for his own crime</segment6>
		<segment7>This is his darkness. In which he will stand. This is his naked inside. Alone in a desert land. And I'm a coward. Shut my eyes and concentrate. On my shell, on soap and shower. Oh God how I want to tell the world. But I hesitate</segment7>
		<segment8>So why don't I have the guts to tell you he's me?    </segment8>
