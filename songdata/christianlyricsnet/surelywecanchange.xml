		<segment1>And the problem is this. We were bought with a kiss. But the cheek still turned. Even when it wasnt hit</segment1>
		<segment2>And I dont know. What to do with a love like that. And I dont know. How to be a love like that</segment2>
		<segment3>When all the love in the world. Is right here among us. And hatred too. And so we must choose. What our hands will do</segment3>
		<segment4>Where there is pain. Let there be grace. Where there is suffering. Bring serenity. For those afraid. Help them be brave. Where there is misery. Bring expectancy. And surely we can change. Surely we can change. Something</segment4>
		<segment5>And the problem it seems. Is with you and me. Not the Love who came. To repair everything</segment5>
		<segment6>Where there is pain. Let us bring grace. Where there is suffering. Bring serenity. For those afraid. Let us be brave. Where there is misery. Let us bring them relief. And surely we can change. Surely we can change. Oh surely we can change. Something</segment6>
		<segment7>Oh, the worlds about to change. The whole worlds about to change     </segment7>
