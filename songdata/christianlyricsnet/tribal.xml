		<segment1>Where do you stand in this battle cry?. Tribal Soldier? Represent!. I and I a Jah Jah warrior. The reconstruction commences, the soldiers equip for the lessons. My life, a sacrifice is made new through these confessions. Manifested, this joy is my desire. Light this fire to flames, praise the name, Jehovah Jireh. Is my provider, the truth that lives inside of this fighter?. Take me higher, Master, Sire, makes me a rider. I'm gonna ride on down till I break through the front lines. And ain't going home until I gets mines</segment1>

		<segment3>I grab ahold of my second chance, this time gonna make it last. Left the world came back an outkast. To lay among the remains, through the trials and the pains. Run for cover, make shelter, uncharted terrains. Bloodstains light the paths to the ways of living breath. My soul is put to the test. Blessed with a mic in my hand, Jah make straight my steps. Then I hooked up with Payable On Death. We flow in unity, stand in one while the foolish be. Lost in this hour, with power we have authority. To overcome while these cowards just pick up and run. We ain't done till this battle has been fought and won. The victory, how sweet it be, is already ours. Holding the stars, is the man that carries my scars. Always the same, I wear his name with no shame. Here in this battle cry, we will never die. We will never die tribal warriors</segment3>
		<segment4>Where do you stand in this battle cry?. Tribal Soldier? Represent!. I and I a Jah Jah warrior    </segment4>
