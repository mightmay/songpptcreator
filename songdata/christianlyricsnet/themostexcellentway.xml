		<segment1>Fred had faith. That could move a big mountain. Fred had a tongue. That flowed like a fountain. Had a big brain bible trained. Gave what he had. To the poor and to the flame. Fred had faith and faith is fine. Fred had a wonderful wonderful mind. What would he need love indeed. Love is the greatest of all of these. Fred had hope carved in stone. Beyond what's seen beyond what's known. Nothing could shake him or take him. Away from the light that the Lord had gave him. Fred had hope and hope is fine. Fred had a wonderful wonderful mind. What would he need love indeed. The most excellent way is love </segment1>
		<segment2>Faith hope and love. But the greatest of these is love </segment2>
		<segment3>Love is more than the act of giving. Live is the key to the art of living. What's the gain from the pain. Without the love of Christ it's all vain. Love is patient love is kind. In thsi song I hope you find. A message of love but what you gonna do. Love is calling get into action. Love is the start of a chain reaction. Love is more much more. Listen ya'll what love is for. Faith hope and love forever. learning to love is the greatest endeavor. So what do we need love indeed. The most excellent way is love </segment3>
		<segment4>Faith hope and love. But the greatest of these is love </segment4>
