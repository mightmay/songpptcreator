		<segment1>on the way to grey. I could hardly wait to see you again. to feel your hands covering me. til the storm is done. what seemed to be the end was not the end at all</segment1>
		<segment2>when I hear the rain should I be afraid for my life?</segment2>
		<segment3>why do you look at me that way?. I told you that I was too busy to see you. I would never keep a secret from you</segment3>
		<segment4>is it over? I am fine. thank you dearly for your time. I'll be leaving. don't you cry. I'll be back soon. at least I'll try. can't you see there is no time to think selfishly. yesterday's gone, tomorrow's here. can't turn back now. I won't quit. I still love you. I swear I always will    </segment4>
