		<segment1>Things are getting tough. you got to hang in there. when you're just about to quit, let God be God. when your back is against the wall. His love will be true. when you're feeling two feet tall. stand upon the rock</segment1>
		<segment2>bridge. don't you be afraid for He is with you. don't you be afraid for He is with you</segment2>
		<segment3>chorus4x. He's comin' back like he Promised He would. let's be ready when the trumpet sounds</segment3>
		<segment4>repeat verse one. bridge. chorus4x. repeat verse one. bridge. chorus 4x    </segment4>
