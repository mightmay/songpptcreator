		<segment1>I run through cars, near and far. Watch me break them all apart. Never mind, that's a lie. I found the cure, all of your. Physical ailments no more. In my mind, you're alright. I'm miles away, across the airwaves. I'm miles out across the airwaves now </segment1>
		<segment2>Dream forever. We can dream forever. Dream forever. We can, together, together. Dream forever. We can dream forever. Still we'll never. Have it together, together </segment2>
		<segment3>I drive through stars, fly my cars. Watch me break the sky apart. Never mind, that's a lie. I always win, perfect skin. Perfect everything within. In my mind, I'm alright. I'm miles away, across the airwaves. I'm miles out across the airwaves now </segment3>
		<segment4>Dream forever. We can dream forever. Dream forever. We can, together, together. Dream forever. We can dream forever. Still we'll never. Have it together, together </segment4>
		<segment5>I'm miles away, across the airwaves. I'm miles out across the airwaves now </segment5>
		<segment6>Dream forever. We can dream forever. Dream forever. We can, together, together. Dream forever. We can dream forever. Still we'll never. Have it together, together     </segment6>
