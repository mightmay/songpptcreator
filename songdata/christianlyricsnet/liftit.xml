		<segment1>Through my temptation to walk away, and through the endless troubled days, there's a hundred million ways, for me to release your praise;. and by and by, and through the tears, and things you've taught me through the years, my whole life was designed by you, I'll never know anyone half as true; </segment1>
		<segment2>I lift it up, I lift it up, lift it up so you can see, I lift it up, I lift it up, lift it up from inside of me; </segment2>
		<segment3>So I lift it, I lift it up to you, and I will never forget, the times that we've been through, so I lift it, I said I lift it up to you;. And I surrender all of me, to you, to you, to you, and. everything I'll ever be, to you, to you, to you, and I surrender all of me;    </segment3>
