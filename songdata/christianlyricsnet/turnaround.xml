		<segment1>Young man on the side of the road. Lost and beat up with no where to go. Smells like a hangover from days ago. He does what he can to survive. Single mom with a dead end job. Ninety hour week just to keep what she's got. With the bills that add up and now she's caught. She does what she can to survive. Well, let me say. That love won't take away the pain. But don't be afraid. 'Cause it will never walk away. If you' re scared that you don't matter. If you' re lost and need to be found. If you' re looking for a Savior. All you gotta do is turn around. Some turn to a bottle. Some turn to a drug. Some turn to another's arms. But it seems like it's never enough. Well I won't say. That you will ever fail again. But there is grace. To wash away your every sin. If you' re scared that you don't matter. If you' re lost and need to be found. If you' re looking for a Savior. All you gotta do is turn around. No one listens to you anymore. And your heart has broken down, you don't need to move. Love has come to you, all you gotta do is turn around. All you gotta do is turn around, turn around. You don't have to. Take the broken road. You can turn around. And come back home. You don't have to. Take the broken road. You can turn around. And come back home. You don't have to Take the broken road. You can turn around And come back home. If you' re scared that you don't matter. If you' re lost and need to be found. If you' re looking for a Savior. All you gotta do is turn around. No one listens to you anymore. And your heart has broken down, you don't need to move. Love has come to you, all you gotta do is turn around. All you gotta do is turn around, turn around    </segment1>
