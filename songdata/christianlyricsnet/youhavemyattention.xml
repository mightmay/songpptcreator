		<segment1>Quiet now, your voice seems miles away. It's somehow I here your song resound. A little bit softer each day. And from my tired heart, a little bit farther away</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll sing along. The whole day through. Just do your best to hear me. It's all you can do</segment2>
		<segment3>You have my attention. Like you've had all the while. Since that first day when you made my heart smile. With loving eyes and tired sighs that flow. You have my attention. Like you shout through an empty sanctuary. Speak but a whisper</segment3>
		<segment4>I'll hear a summer. I'll sing along, the whole day through. Just do your best to hear me. It's all you can do. I'll sing along, the whole night through. While you sleep safely. I'll be thinking about you</segment4>
		<segment5>You have my attention    </segment5>
