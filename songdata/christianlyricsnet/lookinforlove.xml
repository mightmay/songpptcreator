		<segment1>Looking for love in all the wrong places. Just to find someone that can erase. The hurt you feel if you could you'd get a potion. The love of God it flows deeper than an ocean. Lookin' for love you know that I can show you. Cause what I got it goes on and on and on</segment1>
		<segment2>Your heart is broken and wondering. What you can do to ease the hurt and pain you feel. You're letting these no ones get in closer. Than they need to cause you're looking for love. Oh, I've got a feeling no one's told you. No one's bothered at all to give you what you need. So you're out searchin' for something to hold on to. But you don't know it's right there if you'd only see</segment2>
		<segment3>On your own now, doing your own thing. Say you don't need nobody's help to make it through. (But you're really wasting you're time) You're still lonely. (And you know that you're gonna find) That you're only. Left more empty than you were before, oh but I'm telling you. Oh, you don't have to look around</segment3>
		<segment4>Let me tell you bout the love that I have found. Everything that our heart needs, it's just right here. Right here waiting. Oh, you don't have to look no more. Real love is knocking on your door. Everything that your soul needs, it's just right here. Right here waiting for you</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh my friend I'm telling you, I've. been there myself a time or two. When I was just running round, to find. peace for my heart that was beaten down. There's something you need to see, the one who made you. Loves you, please believe. He's all you need to get by, you know. you're somebody so tell me. Why you're..    </segment5>
