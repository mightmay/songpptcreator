		<segment1>I have seen the golden summer light. Flicker in the trees, In the orchard where the long grass. Sways in the breeze. In the shade across the fence. An old man in a chair. Dreams of the names and faces. Who've been there. </segment1>
		<segment2>But lately I have seen you fading. As the world is changing, As the seasons fly. Still my heart in secret. Holds on to the deepest colors. Of the earth and sky. </segment2>
		<segment3>In the graying of the year. When leaves and sunlight fall, Make the shadows of the orchard. Deep and tall. Then the winter comes and covers. All that does not move. Underneath the Sangre Cristo. Stars and moon. </segment3>
		<segment4>But I will come and find you. When the spring unbinds you. Singing of an older time, Still my heart in secret. Holding to the deepest colors. Of the earth and sky.    </segment4>
