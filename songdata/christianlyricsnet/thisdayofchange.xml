		<segment1>Back up let's stop and start again. The words I said now have new meaning. You have changed the ways I once new</segment1>
		<segment2>Your love it found this heart of mine. Showed me you're real and that you're with me. And now I'm growing stronger in you</segment2>
		<segment3>Promises I found in you along the way. Giving all to something new couldn't be the same</segment3>
		<segment4>Today's the day I'm coming around. No more wasting time. On things that won't be found at all</segment4>
		<segment5>A way of faith I once was told. I'm finally finding on my own. And now I'm seeing for the first time</segment5>
		<segment6>A world thats filled with treasures stored. I've traded in for something more. And now I'm living with a new hope</segment6>
		<segment7>Promises I found in you along the way. Giving all to something new couldn't be the same</segment7>
		<segment8>Today's the day I'm coming around. No more wasting time. On things that won't be found at all</segment8>
		<segment9>I have lost myself in you. And I'll keep holding on, holding on</segment9>
		<segment10>Today's the day I'm coming around. No more wasting time. On things that won't be found at all</segment10>
		<segment11>I'm coming around    </segment11>
