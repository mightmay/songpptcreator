		<segment1>This is the body, this is the blood. Broken and poured out for all of us. In this communion, we share in His love. This is the body, this is the blood</segment1>
		<segment2>I will remember everything, Lord, that You've done for me. I won't take for granted the sacrifice that set me free. I hunger and thirst for Your love. Come fill me today</segment2>
		<segment3>We hunger and thirst for Your love and Your righteousness. We long for Your presence here, Lord. Be with us again.     </segment3>
