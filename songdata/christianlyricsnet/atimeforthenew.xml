		<segment1>It is a time for new beginnings. I have known and seen the longings of my people's heart. Many have waited. (Some have waited a life time.). Some have said in their hearts, &quot;God has forgotten.&quot;. Can a mother forget her children?. I have not forgotten my children, whom I hold dear. I spoke, and the world was created. Look to the horizon. It is time for new beginnings.    </segment1>
