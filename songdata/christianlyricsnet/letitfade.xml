		<segment1>Have you been walking on a surface thats uncertain. Have you helped yourself to everything thats empty. You cant live, This way too long, Theres more than this, More than this</segment1>
		<segment2>Have you been standing on your own feet too long. Have you been looking for a place where you belong. You can rest, You will find rest</segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS]. Let this old life crumble, Let it fade, Let this new life offered be your saving grace, Let this old life crumble let it fade, Let it fade</segment3>
		<segment4>Have you been holding on to what this world has offered. Have you been giving in to all these masquerades. It will be gone, Forever gone. It will be gone, It will be gone</segment4>
		<segment5>[CHORUS]</segment5>
		<segment6>Are you carrying the weight too much, Are you running from the call. Let it fade, Oh, yeah</segment6>
		<segment7>You can rest, You will find rest. You can rest, You will find rest</segment7>
		<segment8>[CHORUS]</segment8>
		<segment9>Let it fade</segment9>
		<segment10>Let this whole life crumble, Let it fade</segment10>
		<segment11>Have you been standing on your own feet too long, Have you been looking for a place where you belong    </segment11>
