		<segment1>What can you see in the daytime sky. What do you see in the sky at night. You've been taking cold showers everyday of your life. Looking for the lost parts since '89. Searching for the sum as it all flys by. I've gotta find the roadmaps before we can drive. We gather our stamps and say our goodbyes. We crank up our amps nearly every night. We gotta try our best not to fuss and fight</segment1>
		<segment2>You gotta give up the 1/2s. And make room for the wholes. I can't afford to be mad at you 'cause. You're 1/2 of me.    </segment2>
