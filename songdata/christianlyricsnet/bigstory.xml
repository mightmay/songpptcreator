		<segment1>I hear the rumors of another world. Like distant voices in the wind. They say there is a story being told. Bigger than I can comprehend. And in the rumors I can hear an invitation calling</segment1>
		<segment2>This is the big story. There is a God whos in control. Telling the big story. And he wants us to know. We will find ourselves. When we loose ourselves. In the bigger story. Come and take your place in the story</segment2>
		<segment3>We all live in this place called the here and now. We see whats right before our eyes. But right here right now heavens coming down. All around. Gods story is coming alive. And in this moment if we listen. We can hear him calling</segment3>
		<segment4>This is the big story. There is a God whos in control. Telling the big story. And he wants us to know. We will find ourselves. When we loose ourselves. In the bigger story. Come and take your place in the story</segment4>
		<segment5>Captivating, fascinating, all consuming. Never concluding. One and only. Ever unfolding. Story of stories. The big, big story</segment5>
		<segment6>This is the big story. There is a God whos in control. Telling the big story. And he wants us to know. We will find ourselves. When we loose ourselves. In the bigger story. Come and take your place. Come and take your place. Come and take your place in the story.     </segment6>
