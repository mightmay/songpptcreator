		<segment1>Now part of living right. Is being prepared to fight. That means there's gonna be sleepless nights. In this walk with Christ. But Lord you know. Anytime day or night I'll go. Even if my own mother says no</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Anywhere you lead I'll follow. If you need somebody Lord, I'll go. If nobody else wants to go. I'm saying Lord, it's alright send me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll be glad to go. And let the whole world know. What it takes to be saved for sure. And that they must endure. With my word in hand. I'll spread it through the lands. With the power of prayer I can. Reach the souls of man</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>And for the ones that don't believe. That I will be where he leads me. Even if I have to fall down on my kness. It's alright with me, I'll follow thee</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
