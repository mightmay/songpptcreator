		<segment1>Join with me in graceful dance. And summon the company of angels. The heavens and earth bear witness to this. While all of creation will sing</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Only to you for all eternity. Our voices sing and praise. Only to you all heaven will celebrate. Our Savior our King. Only to you. Only to you. Only to you</segment2>
		<segment3>The one that I love my heart has seen. The day will come-the return of our King. Knees will bow and tongues will confess. All nations all tribes they will sing</segment3>

		<segment5>Join with me in graceful dance. And summon the company of angels. The heavens and earth bear witness to this. While all of creation will sing</segment5>
