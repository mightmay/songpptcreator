		<segment1>Shoulder to the wheel. For someone else's selfish gain. Here there is no choosing. Working the clay. Wearing their anger like a ball and chain.</segment1>
		<segment2>Fire in the field. Underneath a blazing sun. But soon the sun was faded. And freedom was a song. I heard them singing when the day was done. Singing to the holy one.</segment2>
		<segment3>Lead me on. Lead me on. To a place where the river runs. Into your keeping, oh.</segment3>
		<segment4>Lead me on. Lead me on. The awaited deliverance. Comforts the seeking..lead on.</segment4>
		<segment5>Waiting for the train. Labelled with a golden star. Heavy hearted boarding. Whispers in the dark. &quot;where are we going--is it very far? &quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>Bitter cold terrain. Echoes of a slamming door. In chambers made for sleeping, forever. Voices like thunder in a mighty roar. Cry to the lord.</segment6>
		<segment7>Lead me on. Lead me on. To a place where the river runs. Into your keeping, oh.</segment7>
		<segment8>Lead me on. Lead me on. The awaited deliverance. Comforts the seeking..lead on.</segment8>
		<segment9>Man hurts man. Time and time, time again. And we drown in the wake of our power. Somebody tell me why.</segment9>
		<segment10>Lead me on. Lead me on. To a place where the river runs. Into your keeping, oh.</segment10>
		<segment11>Lead me on. Lead me on. The awaited deliverance. Comforts the seeking..lead on.</segment11>
		<segment12>Lead me on. Lead me on. To a place where the river runs. Into your keeping, oh.</segment12>
		<segment13>Lead me on. Lead me on. The awaited deliverance. Comforts the seeking..lead on.    </segment13>
