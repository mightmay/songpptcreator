		<segment1>Alright, alright. Oh yeah oh yeah</segment1>
		<segment2>When the clouds cover up your heart. And the darkness appears. Before the rain starts. Though the hours turn to many days. The hope that soon it will pass. Is what you embrace. For the clouds will rain in a season. Healing drops to wash the hurt away. And the sun will give in its perfect time. Revelations of a brand new day</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. Take heart this time. Know everything will be alright. Rest assured that. Soon as the morning comes. We'll go walkin, walkin in the light. We'll go walkin, walkin in the light</segment3>
		<segment4>Now it seems. Having been here before. One would know by now. When to yield the floor. To the one who created time and space. Knowing sometimes the message. Is simply to wait. For our faith. Is not what could happen. Or the evidence of what we can't see. But hope is what you can still hold to. Never letting go of what you believe</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Should you ever need someone. Just call me, call me, just call me. Its not a question if I'm here for you. I'm right by your side. Through the test of time</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus     </segment7>
