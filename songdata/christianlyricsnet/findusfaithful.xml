		<segment1>We're pilgrims on the journey. Of the narrow road. And those who've gone before us line the way. Cheering on the faithful, encouraging the weary. Their lives a stirring testament to God's sustaining grace</segment1>
		<segment2>Surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us run the race not only for the prize. But as those who've gone before us. Let us leave to those behind us. The heritage of faithfulness. Passed on through godly lives</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful. May the fire of our devotion light their way. May the footprints that we leave. Lead them to believe. And the lives we live inspire them to obey. Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful</segment3>
		<segment4>After all our hopes and dreams have come and gone. And our children sift through all we've left behind. May the clues that they discover. And the memories they uncover. Become the light that leads them. To the road we each must find</segment4>
		<segment5>Repeat Chorus Twice</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful. Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful    </segment6>
