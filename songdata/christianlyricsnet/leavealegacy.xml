		<segment1>I want to give a pure intentions. Speak with words of grace and judge through eyes of mercy. I long to choose with holy wisdom and walk down paths of peace. Taking love to every soul in need</segment1>
		<segment2>I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed. That the world could still be changed by just one life. And I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see. That I lived only for the cause of Christ</segment2>
		<segment3>If I could clearly see tomorrow, a humble prayer would be. That every heart would beat with true faith. If I could somehow shape the future. I would hope and pray I touched lives by the way I lived today</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed. That the world could still be changed by just one life. I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see. That I lived only for the cause of Christ</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, to make a difference. By living day to day. As a reflection of God</segment5>
		<segment6>I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed. That the world could still be changed by just one life. I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see. That I lived only for the cause of Christ</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to leave a legacy of a servant who believed. That the world could still be changed by just one life. And I want to leave a legacy that years from now they'll see. That I lived only for the cause of Christ    </segment7>
