		<segment1>Like a moon that tries to hide away. But the dawn will catch it with the day. Like an angry son that's moving on. But he will never forget his home</segment1>
		<segment2>Feel this grace shining in. There's nowhere that You've not. Walked with me on, carried me on</segment2>
		<segment3>There is nowhere I can go, even in the depths of the sea. You're not too far away. When I wake, when I sleep. You are capturing me with a love that knows no end at all. Like a desert that is dead and dry, but the river fills it up in time. Like a daughter that's been thrown away. Then is adopted by a kinder face.     </segment3>
