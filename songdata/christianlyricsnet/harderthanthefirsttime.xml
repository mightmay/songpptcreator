		<segment1>I walked with you. Just like we've done for so long. You seemed so near. But even that's become so common</segment1>
		<segment2>It's not just you, just been together so long. That I thought I knew everything about you. But today I saw; did you open up my eyes?. 'Cause I feel like I've just seen you for the first time</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. I didn't see you. But God I want to. You've come alive. and I think I've fallen harder than the first time</segment3>
		<segment4>Was I so blind; how did I not see you?. Yet in all that time you never left my side. So for all my life, I will live to know you. So here I am; I'll take your hand</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. I see your face; I feel you close. The love you've always shown me. Won't miss it now, can't waste a day. Jesus I'm yours completely</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus    </segment7>
