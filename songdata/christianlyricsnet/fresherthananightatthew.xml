		<segment1>Yo, its me, Tobymac and I dont meanto trouble you. Im feelin fresher than a night at the W. You probably sayin you be hearin quite enough of you. With God and your rhymes and that freaky Jesus stuff you do. Like always pushin for that racial diversity. Leave us alone were at home in our fantasies. I know a guy who knows a guy who has brown skin. What in his wallet it so happens Im around him. Well never be that shinin city on a hill yall. Until we show and prove to the people what is real yall. Its like were stale dirty water in the tub of life. Gimme a fire that inspires all the world tonight. Gimme a fire that inspires all the world tonight    </segment1>
