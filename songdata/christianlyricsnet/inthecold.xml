		<segment1>And the words they take their meaning (It's all you said). and the flame, it loses colour (It's all you said). Take take take a while, take a while (It's all you said)</segment1>
		<segment2>Knowing that it's far from over. This one belongs to you</segment2>
		<segment3>Time shows us that all that ever mattered. all that ever mattered leaves us in the cold. If you ever believe this what you need. it will spin around and shatter. throw you to the floor. as it leaves us in the cold</segment3>
		<segment4>And the dream you think I'm making. while the house I built is breaking. Take take take a while, take a while (It's all you said)</segment4>
		<segment5>Knowing that it's far from over. this one belongs to you</segment5>
		<segment6>Time shows us that all that ever mattered. all that ever mattered leaves us in the cold. If you ever believe this what you need. it will spin around and shatter. throw you to the floor. as it leaves us in the cold</segment6>
		<segment7>I remember the train you came in on. Everything I want kept calling. I remember the chill that came over. Everything I love went falling</segment7>
		<segment8>Time shows us that all that ever mattered. all that ever mattered leaves us in the cold. If you ever believe this what you need. it will spin around and shatter. throw you to the floor. as it leaves us in the cold    </segment8>
