		<segment1>I dont know how You love me. but Youre knocking at my door. how can I ask You to take me. when its been like this before. I cant guess why You want me. just exactly as I am. cause even though Im still me. still You always understand</segment1>
		<segment2>all I know is the darkness goes. when You take me in</segment2>
		<segment3>you know it sounds crazy. you know its hard to believe. when You say that You love me. somebody like me. and though Ill never understand Your ways. Ill believe in every word You say</segment3>
		<segment4>I dont know how to thank You. after all the work Youve done. and I cant wait just to watch You</segment4>
		<segment5>finish up what Youve begun. I cant guess where Youll lead me. but I know this much is true. that where You and I will be. I will be chasing after You    </segment5>
