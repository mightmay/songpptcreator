		<segment1>Onward we will go. This urgency is real. Recount where we belong. The undertaking </segment1>
		<segment2>The thoughts of reproduction, Of telling has been used. There is no one original. Like when we began anew. We have to try to be. What you say we can be. Its come to killing time. A time to sacrifice for free. No more of this and that. They gave my life to play. Be on, be on the stage *. And in another way. We have to try to be. What you say we can be. I've made the choice to stay. So now you have the right to say </segment2>
		<segment3>Onward we will go. This urgency is (real). Recount where we belong. The undertaking </segment3>
		<segment4>I've studied secret lives. I've studied decent words. Somethings I can't take back. The words the hurt the worst. The days were long and dry. I long to live again. When we were young and dumb. We didn't have to plan. I wonder will I wait. My plan is ready now. Procede to staging marks. The actors take their bow. A long decision plain. I long to live again. I've made the choice to stay. So now you have the right to say </segment4>
		<segment5>Onward we will go. This urgency is (real). Recount where we belong. The undertaking. Now to you and I. Sometimes I hate to (look). Look me in the eye. See what we believe </segment5>
		<segment6>Plead is all we do *. Knowing not what we've done. Famous last words like these. No more, one more, one more. </segment6>
		<segment7>Onward we will go. This urgency is (real). Recount where we belong. The undertaking. Now to you and I. Sometimes I hate to (look). Look me in the eye. I see what we believe     </segment7>
