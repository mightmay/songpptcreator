		<segment1>Relent to your useless devices. Retreat, your last line of defense. Regress to the hollow relationships that shield you from yourself </segment1>
		<segment2>Relent to your fortress of skin. Retreat, anything to distract. Regress to your hands as they cover your eyes. But you can't help but peek through the cracks </segment2>
		<segment3>Cold, hard dread swelling into parallels. To everything you ever said you'd repel. Once with a glimpse now. Second your guess it's. Tough to admit and admit and admit that </segment3>
		<segment4>Your fate's still undecided. Return. Return. Return </segment4>
		<segment5>Relent, to the terror that distances you. Retreat, to habitual grins. Regress, to deception, quiet and time. Once was transformed, now exactly the same. Remember when you nearly plunged into embrace?. But instead you've chosen to keep it all at bay </segment5>
		<segment6>Return to yourself.     </segment6>
