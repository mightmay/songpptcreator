		<segment1>O, for a thousand tongues to sing. My great Redeemers praise. The glories of my God and King. The triumphs of His grace</segment1>
		<segment2>My gracious Master and my God. Assist me to proclaim. To spread through all the earth abroad. The honors of Thy name</segment2>
		<segment3>So come on and sing out. Let our anthem grow loud. There is one great love Jesus</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus, the name that charms our fears. That bids our sorrows cease. Tis music in the sinners ears. Tis life and health and peace</segment4>
		<segment5>He breaks the power of cancelled sin. He sets the prisoners free. His blood can make the foulest clean. His blood availed for me</segment5>
		<segment6>He speaks and listening to His voice. New life the dead receive. The mournful broken hearts rejoice. The humble poor believe</segment6>
		<segment7>Glory to God and praise and love. Be ever, ever givn. By saints below and saints above. The church in earth and Heavn</segment7>
		<segment8>There are so few words. That never grow old. There are so few words. That never grow old. Jesus     </segment8>
