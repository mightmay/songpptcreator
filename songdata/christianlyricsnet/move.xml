		<segment1>(Originally recorded by The Clergy) </segment1>
		<segment2>So many different things I hold in my hand, But I don't hold them there. Gravity holds them down, Gods finger picks them up moves them around. </segment2>
		<segment3>Some of them I wanted to stay, some were a happy release. Others appeared with joyous surprises others too heavy for grief. </segment3>
		<segment4>Move it around. Pick it up and move it around. </segment4>
		<segment5>These things I hold them an offering to God. He sees my hand and then. Raises me seven on my knees. I will trust and obey. </segment5>
		<segment6>Move it around. Pick it up and move it around. </segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
