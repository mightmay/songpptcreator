		<segment1>last one turns the lights out, and makes sure every curtain\'s drawn. nails the shutters shut, he\'s sure. we are not of this world for long. who do you think you are?. did you figure out the date?. what do you hope to do. while you sit around and wait, wait, wait?. last one turns the lights out, and disconnects the answer-phone. stuffs all sense of mission, says. \&quot;I just can\'t turn the tide alone\&quot;. who do you think you are?. did you figure out the time?. what do you hope to do. while you hide out and whine, whine, whine..</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. DON\'T GO SHUTTIN\' DOWN. \'TIL THE TRUMPET SOUNDS. AND THE BATTLE IS WON. DON\'T GO PUNCHIN\' OUT. \'TIL THE FINAL SHOUT. AND THE FATHER SAYS, \&quot;WELL DONE\&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>last one turns the light out, and just keeps playing dumb. these were his instructions, he\'s not sure where he got \'em from. why do you wanna hide in a separate class?. why do you buy the lie. of a faith under glass, glass, glass..</segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus -</segment4>
		<segment5>last one turns the lights out, and climbs up to the top of the roof. he\'s sitting there \'til the Second Coming. says he\'s got mathematical proof. who do you think you are?. did you figure out the date?. what do you hope to do. while you sit around and wait, wait, wait..</segment5>
		<segment6>- Chorus -    </segment6>
