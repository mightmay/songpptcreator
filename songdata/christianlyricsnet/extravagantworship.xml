		<segment1>Doesnt matter what people sayI forget their watching eyes. I just want to bring to You. My most costly, my most priceless, my most precious Sacrifice </segment1>
		<segment2>Extravagant worship. Total surrender. Reckless abandon. I pour out my love, pour out myself. Saviour. Breaking open my thankful heart I release its praise perfume. Here Ill linger lifting to You. Songs of wonder, songs of worship Songs of deepest gratitude    </segment2>
