		<segment1>In an old apartment waiting for the walls to move. Praying that someone, hoping that no one intrudes. Living like an actor, feeling like a poet bruised</segment1>
		<segment2>But no man is an island</segment2>
		<segment3>Lay down your robe, leper or rogue, keep yourself open here. Don't let the cold close to your soul, lonely tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>Passing like a shadow, never letting anyone see. Maybe I'm biased, but I don't think you know. the first thing about me</segment4>
		<segment5>Lay down your robe, leper or rogue, keep yourself open here. Don't let the cold close to your soul, no one is free come light. Heavier stones think to themselves, that they're alone here. But everyone grieves and everyone feels lonely tonight</segment5>
		<segment6>Don't tell me you know, when I know you don't.     </segment6>
