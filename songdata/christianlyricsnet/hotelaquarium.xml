		<segment1>Is this another complication I face?. Here is the mistake coming back to catch me. To you, to You I hold </segment1>
		<segment2>Now I know that I'm alive. All the loneliness is filled by you inside. And as I finally breathe the air. You open up my eyes and now I'm alive </segment2>
		<segment3>The lesson in breathing, is never using control. Seconds to misplaced I've never been so unsure. To you, to You I hold</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I know that I'm alive. All the loneliness is filled by you inside. And as I finally breathe the air. You open up my eyes and now I'm alive</segment4>
		<segment5>To the heights, to the heights, there is hope. It's been waiting all along. To the heights, to the heights, there is hope. Waiting.</segment5>
		<segment6>Now I know that I'm alive. All the loneliness is filled by you inside. And as I finally breathe the air. You open up my eyes and now I'm alive.     </segment6>
