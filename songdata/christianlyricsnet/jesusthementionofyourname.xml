		<segment1>Chorus: Jesus, Jesus, at the mention of Your name. Every knee will bow and tongue proclaim. Jesus, Jesus, You are savior, You are Lord, You are God</segment1>

		<segment3>There is one name I love to hear. I love to sing its worth. It sounds like music in my ear. The sweetest name on earth</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus:</segment4>
		<segment5>So now we worship and adore You. We lift our hands and praise. The Immortal, Invisible. The Ancient Of Days. Creation bows before You. As Your children give You praise. You're the only One. That's worthy of this song</segment5>
