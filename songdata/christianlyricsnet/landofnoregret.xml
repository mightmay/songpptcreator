		<segment1>For every wide eyed dreamer. Who lies awake at night. Wondering what giving everything. Would be like. You are not alone. To each and every student. Who will stand against the tide. And resist what is expected. By doing what is right. To the passionate young preacher. Who is not afraid to do. The things that his heart tells him. At the risk of becoming a fool. You are not alone. You are not alone. We're out here and we're everywhere. And together is where we belong. Won't you come along. Together we'll travel on. We can't miss the chance or ever forget. That we belong in the land of no regret    </segment1>
