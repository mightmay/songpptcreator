		<segment1>i am so thirsty. i'd drink all of the sea. i am drying up inside. my life is drained. my well is empty. i need to be filled. let the fountain spring in me eternally. rain. rain down beautiful grace. rain all over my face. rain down beautiful grace. and wash all these stains away. i feel the water. falling over me. a holy shower from heaven shed. i'm soaking wet.     </segment1>
