		<segment1>With eyes so blind. How did I see a single thing?. I missed the scenery. Change in front of me</segment1>
		<segment2>And as for these hands. Well they've got a lot to answer for. They built me a house of sand. On someone else's land</segment2>
		<segment3>Deep down I knew I was lost. But I kept my fingers crossed. As if that would somehow rescue me</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: How did I sleep?. How did I sleep?. How did I sleep without You?. Without You</segment4>
		<segment5>Tired all the time. But there is no rest for the wicked. Under the covers I pretended not to cry</segment5>
		<segment6>And there You were: Magnified by the tears. Reaching Your hands to me. Waiting patiently</segment6>
		<segment7>I never dared to dream. Of the morning my eyes have seen. Awake for the first time: rise and shine</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus)    </segment8>
