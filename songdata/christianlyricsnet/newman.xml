		<segment1>Eye is to the body as a thought is to the soul. They're both a lamp whose sharpness I control. Beauty lingers 'bout as long as flattery my friend. That door doesn't let out but lets back in</segment1>
		<segment2>I was full of everything, my eyes put on this plate. Full of joy I'm needing, less of late. I can return love to You the best that I know how. I believe my worth has been redeemed. And I can be a new man now</segment2>
		<segment3>Flatterers can fill a room as readily as this. The devil goes to dinner amidst their bliss. Following the need will lead me farther from truth's well. Then only to be filled with what I miss</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm a new man, I'm a new man</segment4>
		<segment5>Like I said, there's always room where one keeps all things dear. I'll shrink away from sight and thought and evil that appears</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm a new man, I'm a new man.    </segment6>
