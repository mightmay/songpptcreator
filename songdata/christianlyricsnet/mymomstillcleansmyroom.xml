		<segment1>I'm not always nice, not always mean. My room has never been seen clean. The way I feel is not always how I seem </segment1>
		<segment2>The thoughts that form inside my brain. Don't always seem to entertain. 'Cause when I tell my company. They think there's something wrong with me </segment2>
		<segment3>You don't know me like you think you do. You don't understand me and it's true </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm getting older day by day. Ain't got time to get to everything. Hold on tight, enjoy the ride. Life is short, so live it wisely </segment4>
		<segment5>I'm not always sick, but often tired. Sometimes I'm having fun or wired. I don't have someone to call my own </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm not full of all the answers. I guess that I'm an o.k. dancer. I just want to be left alone.     </segment6>
