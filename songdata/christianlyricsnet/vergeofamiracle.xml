		<segment1>Clung to a ball. That was hung in the sky. Hurled into orbit. There You are. Whether you fall down. Or whether you fly. Seems you can never get too far. Someone's waiting to put wings. Upon your flightless heart</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: You're on the verge of a miracle. Standing there. Oh you're on the verge of a miracle. Just waiting to be believed in. Open your eyes and see. You're on the verge of a miracle</segment2>
		<segment3>Here in your room. Where nobody can see. Voices are loud. But seldom clear. But beneath the confusion. That's running so deep. There is a promise you must hear. The love that seems so far away. Is standing very near</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>When you've played out. Your last chance. And your directions. Have all been lost. When the roads that you look down. Are all dead ends. Look up. You could see if you'd just look up</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
