		<segment1>Baby close that suitcase you've been packin'. Just sit down and talk to me a while. I know you tried to tell me what was lackin'. But I guess I must have missed it by a mile. Well this time girl I swear I'll listen. Help me understand where I went wrong. It's hard to find myself in this position. Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone</segment1>
		<segment2>Help me hold on..to what we had. Once our love was strong, it can be again. You said it takes two, to make love last. You were right all along, so help me hold on</segment2>
		<segment3>What have I got to do to make it better?. What have I got to do to make you see. That even though I promised you forever. I never knew how hard that would be. I realize I took your love for granted. But I've learned that love worth havin' don't come free. And I'll pay and price it takes to keep you. Satisfied and stayin' here with me</segment3>
		<segment4>Help me hold on..to what we had. Once our love was strong, it can be again. You said it takes two, to make love last. You were right all along, so help me hold on</segment4>
		<segment5>Help me hold on..to what we had. Once our love was strong, it can be again. You said it takes two, to make love last. You were right all along, so help me hold on</segment5>
		<segment6>You were right all along. So help me hold on    </segment6>
