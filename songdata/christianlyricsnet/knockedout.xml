		<segment1>How did I get here I'm all tied up. I'm all tied up. I never noticed or cared that much. Or cared that much. Complacency has gotten the best of me. And the best of me is forgotten. Beneath the sea of what I've become. And all that I've done I hope that it counts. I'd rather be knocked down. Than to be knocked out. So I'll let go of what I know, Of what I've learned here in the past twenty years. My heart is frozen with meaningless motions. So I'll hold on to you. And all that I've done. I hope that it counts. I've been knocked down. But I'm not knocked out. And I'm at the bottom. Can't get myself out. I've been knocked down. But not knocked out. Not knocked out. And I will sing at the top of my lungs. I will dance even if I'm the only one. And I hope that we'll never be apart. And I will sing and I hope it heals my heart. Yeah I hope it heals my heart. How did I get here?. Save me from this.     </segment1>
