		<segment1>I remember when I'd run to you through fields of white flowers. Your embrace was my air. How I needed you there. All of the world and all of it's powers couldn't keep you love from me. I need you like the dragonfly's wings need the wind, like the orphan needs home once again, like heaven needs more to come in. I need you here like you've always been. Then I waved goodbye to you from fields of white flowers. You were so proud of me. I was too proud to see that all of the wolrd. and all of it's powers couldn't keep your love from me.. taking for granted all of her smiles that got away. Now I'm looking up at you from fields of white flowers. You were so proud of me. I'm so proud of you. All of the world and all of it's powers couldn't keep your love from me.    </segment1>
