		<segment2>chorus: You are comforter that's who you are to me. Comforter a name that fits so perfectly. Peace that passes all understanding. Comforter is who you are to me.</segment2>
		<segment3>verse2: To the grieving family who weeps for loved ones gone. The pain of separation consumes another home. On the waves of sorrow. You walk with perfect ease. Comforter is who the whole world needs.</segment3>
		<segment4>repeat chorus: You are comforter that's who you are to me. Comforter a name that fits so perfectly. Peace that passes all understanding. Comforter is who you are to me</segment4>
