		<segment1>it's so cold and dark. and damp on this mountain side. in you in you alone. i long long to confide. cause even tho ive seen you set ablaze. that alter thats spoken wet. still i long just to hear you in. the voice i havent heard yet. Not in the fire lord or in the earthquake. my soul shakes for you. when i humbly called your name. how you softly came. yeah. in a gentle whisper. i sit amazed and broken. as the breeze comes and cools my face. sweet harmonies of the wind pulls me in. and they let me know your in this place. but the breeze soon fades away with the night. leaving me alone in my sin. oh i know i could follow you. if i could just hear your voice one more time again. Not in the fire lord or in the earthquake. my soul shakes for you. when i humbly called your name. how you softly came. yeah. in a gentle whisper. tear stains on your face. blood stains on your brow. wrestle in their fashion for the sould of man. when will they hear you. Not in the fire lord or in the earthquake. my soul shakes for you. when i humbly called your name. how you softly came. yeah. in a gentle whisper. (repeat)    </segment1>
