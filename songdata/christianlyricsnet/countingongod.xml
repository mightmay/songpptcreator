		<segment1>VERSE 1. I'm in a fight not physical. And I'm in a war. But not with this world. You are the light that's beautiful. And I want more. I want all that's Yours</segment1>
		<segment2>PRE-CHORUS. Joy unspeakable that won't go away. And just enough strength. To live for today. So I never have to worry. What tomorrow will bring. 'Cause my faith is on solid rock. I am counting on God</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. I am counting on. I am counting on God</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE. The miracle of Christ in me. Is the mystery that sets me free. I'm nothing like I used to be. Open up your eyes you'll see.     </segment4>
