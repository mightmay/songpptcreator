		<segment1>How can you say there is no way my God is real. Believing in the lies, you try to rationalize what you fell. When the earth, the seas, the sky, the trees, the birds, the bees all made by He. My lord of all. Hallelujah (4x). When the trumpets sound the dead will rise. We'll de called up in the skies to see heavens gates standing tall. But when you hear Him call your name, will you be able to proclaim. In my Lord of all. Hallelujah (5x). All hail the power of jesus name let angels prostrate fall. Bring forth the royal diadem and crown Him Lord of all. He died for you he died for me. All you have to do is just believe. In my Lord of all    </segment1>
