		<segment1>She clutched her square phone with eyes that never held hope. and she about 12 yo but I really couldnt tell though. her sleeves went past her elbows in when she pulled them low. they covered the cuts that ran back and forth like railroads. a short bow up in her hair that matched her shell toes. she stared at me in pale clothes she stood there froze. she said can I show you a picture in my cellphone. its of my dad and aint I seen him since he left home. but I aint mad its just my mom she feels all alone. and dont feel bad cause this is all weve ever came to know. this pic is my new school but I dont ever wants to go. cuz everyone thinks they too cool and I hate it so. I hide in my room and then I go and then I locks the door. I dont know what to do my mom she thinks she lost control. I wanna show you a little picture before I gots to roll. I said sure then she pulled it out slow saying. </segment1>
		<segment2>if I told you if I showed you. my pictures are all I can hold to. would I know you could I hope you. see that my pictures are all I can hold to </segment2>
		<segment3>if God loves me then why he make me face this. I think Im ugly I wanna change it like a facelift. then suddenly she went and took off her bracelets. showed me the cuts up on wrists and where they made prints. sometime I get mad dont know how to take this. she showed me a picture of her dad back in 86. we look alike all the way to how our face gets. I said your right and then I laughed but let me show this </segment3>
		<segment4>they say a pictures worth a thousand words that Im sure of. but let me show you this very picture you aint never heard of. pulled out a book and she said well tell me what is that. there aint no pictures in that book thats just a page thats black. I said this picture represents exactly where we at. we in the dark without a spark of hope that will last. I flipped the page she said that aint a picture neither. thats just a blank page, why dont you look a bit deeper. this represents the very place now that we can go. its all based on this next page I gots to show. the next page is red you understanding this?. well thats the blood that Jesus shed so you can live. and you can exchange your old pictures right now for Him. and you can trade it all in for what hes down to give. I put the pictures in her hands see it comes down to this. which ones you holding on to yours or His    </segment4>
