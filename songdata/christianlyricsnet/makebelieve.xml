		<segment1>How did I get so far from the promises I made?. Life it seems so dark compared to yesterday. Everything I had the gift that I received. Is slipping through my hands. Now it's only make believe</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I'm fading away and I feel like I can't breathe. Tomorrow's gone. How long until I break?. I'm fading away and I'm trapped inside of me. Tomorrow's gone. How long until I break?</segment2>
		<segment3>All the things I chose that slowly took Your place. Are laughing back at me and I can't make it go away. My life is crashing down, another tragedy. Another broken dream, now it's only make believe</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)    </segment4>
