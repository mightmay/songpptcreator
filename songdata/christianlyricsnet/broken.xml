		<segment1>Broken when I'm kneeling. I find in my hidden shelter with you. Raw and pure is treasure I know. Deep within your presence o Lord </segment1>
		<segment2>And this hopefulness you give me. Nothing can compare </segment2>
		<segment3>And as the world will change. You'll always be the same. And the days will fade away. But you remain the same </segment3>
		<segment4>Broken when I realize. That you love me in my weakness. And you have given more in my life And I'm humbled by your kindness o Lord. And you will always be the same.     </segment4>
