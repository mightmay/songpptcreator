		<segment1>call yourself, call yourself human, you call your self humane. promote green peace to save the trees and contribute to society. but your a monster, murder, evil black beast. you decided you could kill your child, all because you thought it was a mistake</segment1>
		<segment2>abortion, is murder. abortion, your concious sin is red</segment2>
		<segment3>you killed your kid, they sacrificed, so you could, live what you call free. i fall down on my knees and cry, when i think of all the kids who die. unimaginable tha is what it is, to think of that poor child. that complication which the doctors call it, is a living breathing person</segment3>
		<segment4>abortion, is murder. abortion, your concious sin is red    </segment4>
