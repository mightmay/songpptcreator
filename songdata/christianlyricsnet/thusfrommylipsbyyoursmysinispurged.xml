		<segment1>well, I've got a will but I want yours. I've got a growing heap of crosses and burdens. I've simply lost heart to shoulder. simply no strength to lift. I've always been a man in need. 'cause I keep stepping in and out of the shadow</segment1>
		<segment2>caught by the drift and pitch of whatever it is. that keeps me coming back. I want out. 'cause I'm getting sick. sick from all this swerving. driver, sick from turning on you</segment2>
		<segment3>someone show me a hole in this cycle. show me the way away and i'm coming back. the way I came. no! I've seen this place before. surely this is no place for the light of this world</segment3>
		<segment4>oh how sweet the sound. I know it saved but is it changing a wretch like me. oh my God how sweet is the sound. I once was blind but now I just look away</segment4>
		<segment5>my bride, I don't want to know what I'd be without. forgiveness brushing these adulterous lips    </segment5>
