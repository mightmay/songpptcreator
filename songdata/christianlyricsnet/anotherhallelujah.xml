		<segment1>(verse 1). I love You Lord with all my heart. You've given me a brand new start. And I just want to sing this song to You. It goes like this the fourth the fifth. The minor fall the major lift. My heart and soul are praising. Hallelujah</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujan, hallelujah</segment2>
		<segment3>(verse 2). I know that You're the God above. You're filling me with grace and love. And I just want to say thank You to You. You pulled me from the miry clay. You've given me a brand new day. Now all that I can say is. Hallelujah    </segment3>
