		<segment1>Verse 1: I never knew a love like this before. In a orld full of lies, So many broken promises. It's so hard to believe. Any love can last. Forever and ever. Now, I'm just an ordinary. Kind of fellow, But I know exactly what I believe. And let me tell you </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I still believe in you, I still believe what you say is true, I still believe in you. My God is alive. </segment2>
		<segment3>I still believe in you, No matter what they say or do, I still believe in you. Lord, I still believe in you. </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: I've heart it 'bout a. Thousand times before. How the world ain't changing. Just take a look around you. Man, if God ain't dead, Then He must be slowly dying, But I've read the book of life. And I know just where I'm going. So just hold on, 'cause the story ain't over yet. </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus:..     </segment5>
