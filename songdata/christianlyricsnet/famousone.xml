		<segment1>You are the Lord. The famous one, famous one. Great is Your name in all the earth. The heavens declare. You're glorious, glorious. Great is Your fame beyond the earth</segment1>
		<segment2>For all You've done and yet to do. With every breath I'm praising You. Desire of the nations and every heart. You alone are God. You alone are God</segment2>
		<segment3>The morning star is shining through. And every eye is watching You. Revealed by nature and miracles. You are beautiful. You are beautiful    </segment3>
