		<segment1>This is my final resting place, I'm never gonna let my hands wander free. This will be my unchanging phase. You're never gonna see my sad and guilty ways again. Time and time I find. That my words will never reach you if I can't seem to meet you. And I hope that you don't mind. But this happy edning is now descending, I apologize for the last time. I'm standing by my eternal grave, Listening to myself stumble through this eulogy. I've laid to rest all of my mistakes. you're never gonna see my sad and guilty ways again    </segment1>
