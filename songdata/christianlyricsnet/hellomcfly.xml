		<segment1>A roll of the dice. A slip of the tongue. I was stirring up the hornets' nest. and finally got me stung. Whoa Oh Whoa Oh. Said I'd do the right thing. But the wrong was done. It's over, exuse my grammer. But the fat lady sung. whoa oh whoa oh</segment1>
		<segment2>And I wish I was Michael J Fox. I'd visit the past. Then come back to the future (Hello McFly). When I cleaned up my act</segment2>
		<segment3>Yeah I don't know. What went through my head. Was my conscience shot?. Was it left for dead?</segment3>
		<segment4>I said I'm sorry. But no one heard. 'cause actions (actions) actions. Actions speak louder than words</segment4>
		<segment5>I think I made God angry. and I'm sure that he's irate. I just hope my remorse was not too little too late. whoa oh whoa oh</segment5>
		<segment6>Even my track record. He gave me a clean slate. I'm forgiven and I'm livin'. With no sin on my plate. whoa oh whoa oh</segment6>
		<segment7>And I wish I was Michael J Fox. I'd visit the past. Then come back to the future (Hello McFly). When I cleaned up my act</segment7>
		<segment8>Yeah I don't know. What went through my head. Was my conscience shot?. Was it left for dead?</segment8>
		<segment9>I said I'm sorry. But no one heard. 'cause actions (actions) actions. Actions speak louder than words    </segment9>
