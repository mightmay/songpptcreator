		<segment1>Out in the darkness with a heart of stone. I was a rebel with a wandering soul. Restless and tired of my broken life. I prayed that You would hear my desperate cry </segment1>
		<segment2>Then shining brighter than the midday sun Breaking the darkness like a bright new dawn. Came One more beautiful than I had seen and. Jesus came and set this prisoner free </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I will never forget the way. You ran to me when I was far away. And You threw Your arms around me. I will never forget that day. You looked at me and then You called my name. And You pulled me from the darkness. Now I'm glowing </segment3>
		<segment4>You took my searching hand and led me home Gathered my broken life and made me whole. I'm resting peaceful in Your sweet embrace. My grateful heart will never cease to praise You</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I will stand and tell the world about. The way You took my hand the way. You pulled me out. My sin was overcome by sinless blood. my freedom won. I'll sing this song </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus </segment6>
		<segment7>Refrain: With a light inside come down from heaven. Glowing. You touched this heart of stone and now I'm. Glowing. Let the whole world see Your Spirit in me. Glowing.. Burns so bright</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Let all the world see. Your light glowing in me!.     </segment9>
