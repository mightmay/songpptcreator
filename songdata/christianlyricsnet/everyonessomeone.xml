		<segment1>find yourself. ya' darkest enemy. given up on what you thought you'd be. plans were made. nothing's really changed. be planning on one thing. you're loved just the same </segment1>
		<segment2>when it all comes 'round. everyone's someone. when it all comes 'round. everyone's someone </segment2>
		<segment3>kinda look old. like a man with everything. give it all for something real. no you can't take it with you. nothing's forged, nothing's new. do i imagine being you. maker of the rain. lets it fall the same on me and you </segment3>
		<segment4>no matter who you are. no matter where you run. no matter what you do. what you're going through    </segment4>
