		<segment1>&quot;the steps of faith fall on the seeming void, but find the rock beneath.&quot;. -john g. whittier</segment1>
		<segment2>i guess i thought a letter would be less confusing. so for your eyes i write another waterlogged excuse. toil and turn and watch another secret burn. controlling words is just something i just wasn't born to do. there is a secret beneath you</segment2>
		<segment3>in my silence i defend my common sense. and i see through all the stupid things i do</segment3>
		<segment4>it's hard to write a letter with an open mind. when all i saw was underneath a satisfied embrace. that exposed your wondrous face</segment4>
		<segment5>in my silence i defend my common sense. as i'm walking along my familiar fence. and i see though all the stupid things i do. and that this path i'm on will never lead to you</segment5>
		<segment6>in my silence i defend my common sense. as i'm walking along my familiar fence. and i see though all the stupid things i do. and that this path i'm on will never lead to you. and i'm looking back to only see a spark. as i finally take a step into the dark    </segment6>
