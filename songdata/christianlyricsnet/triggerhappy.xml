		<segment1>Man this world's going down the tubes. With gangs and guns and drug abuse. For the moments whatcha got to lose. Extend a hand, do what you can do. This is my cry, this is my plea. To make a better society. Do you want to se inside of me?</segment1>
		<segment2>Wake up and smell the coffee. Any punk can point and pull the trigger. But it takes a real man to bite you lip and take a stand. Any punk can point and pull the trigger. To walk away is a loss of pride but at least your still alive. Gotta act big, gotta stare me down. You're acting stupid like a drunken clown. You could be foolin', may be joking around. Someday your jokes may put you in the ground. Lord, oh please, I'm so confused</segment2>
		<segment3>Why do they do what they do?. Why can't they focus more on You?. They are blind to the truth. Any punk can point and pull the trigger. But it takes a real man to bite you lip and take a stand. Any punk can point and pull the trigger. To walk away is a loss of pride but. at least your still alive (2X). Put down your guard, let your fist relax. Don't need your boys to get your back. Say something nice, don't always attack</segment3>
		<segment4>No one gets hurt, no one gets wacked. Change your style and you will see. It's much better in unity. No more violence, no more pain. Jesus saves from going down the drain!. Down the drain, down the drain, down the drain, down the drain. Yeah, yeah, down the drain, down the drain. Yeah, yeah, down the drain, down the drain    </segment4>
