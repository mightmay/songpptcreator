		<segment1>I know a girl whos growing up too fast. Shes stuck between her future and her past. Cause shes just a baby but the doctors say. Shes got a baby on the way </segment1>
		<segment2>And now the devastation makes her start to cry. How could this be happening she wonders why. But theyre talking options like its just another day. And the choice is hers to make </segment2>
		<segment3>Theres a life inside you. Theres a beating heart. Theres a child of wonder. Shining like a star. Theres a life inside you</segment3>
		<segment4>I know a boy whos all caught up. In his addictions and theyre tearing him up. And now hes hearing voices telling him its time to let go. But if I could talk to that boy. I would die for him to know</segment4>
		<segment5>We all arrive here in this place. Imperfect people in need of grace. But thats why God sent His only Son to die. So that every broken heart could have a life inside. So, just open up your broken heart. Can you feel it     </segment5>
