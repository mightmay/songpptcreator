		<segment1>I had all the pieces put together. I thought it was all under control. But now I am face to face with failure. I'm fighting these fears I've never known. I'm falling to my knees</segment1>
		<segment2>Would You hold me, would You hold me up?. 'Cause I can barely, I can barely stand. The weight I carry is gonna pull me under</segment2>
		<segment3>God I need You, yeah, I need You now. 'Cause all around me my world's crashing down. And You're the only, You're the only One. That can hold me up</segment3>
		<segment4>Take me away from all the chaos. Give me the strength to live again. There is a truth found in the promise. That You are the hope that never ends. I'm crying out Lord, please</segment4>
		<segment5>Would You hold me, would You hold me up?. 'Cause I can barely, I can barely stand. The weight I carry is gonna pull me under</segment5>
		<segment6>God I need You, yeah, I need You now. 'Cause all around me my world's crashing down. And You're the only, You're the only One, yeah</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm desperate for Your peace. I'm crying out Lord, please</segment7>
		<segment8>Would You hold me, would You hold me up?. 'Cause I can barely, I can barely stand. The weight I carry is gonna pull me under</segment8>
		<segment9>God I need You, yeah, I need You now. 'Cause all around me my world's crashing down. And You're the only, You're the only One. That can hold me up, that can hold me up.     </segment9>
