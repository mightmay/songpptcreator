		<segment1>I've seen Your face on stained glass in colored lights. In pictures of You looking to the sky. You have portrayed a thousand different ways. But my heart can see You better than my eyes. Cause it's love that paints the portrait of Your life</segment1>
		<segment2>The face of love, the face of love. You look more like love everyday</segment2>
		<segment3>I've read Your words in the pages of Your life. And I've imagined what You were like. I may not know the shape of Your face. But I can feel Your heart changing mine. And Your love still proves that You're alive</segment3>
		<segment4>You are the face that changed the whole world. No one too lost for You to love. No one too low for You to serve. So give us the grace to change the world. No one too lost for me to love. No one too low for me to serve</segment4>
		<segment5>Let us see, let us see Your face.     </segment5>
