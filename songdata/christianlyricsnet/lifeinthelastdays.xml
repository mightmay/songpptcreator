		<segment1>It's pretty hard to understand, but it's totally awesome .. and it's eternally true. Who wrote the book?. It was John the Apostle .. from the Lord, to me and you. It's a fantastic revelation of the future news. It came from Jesus; it'll come true. When he saw Jesus comin', John fell down as dead. He told him, &quot;Get up, Johnny, and write this down instead. &quot; Life in the last days .. sure to make you lose your mind Life in the last days .. uh huh He saw four horsemen, holding the reigns Of colorful stallions, who brought different things. He who rode the white conquered, and the red one brought war. And the black one brought famine;. then pale horse number four.  There was death in the saddle, ridin' out through space He had Hades right behind him,  killed a fourth of the human race. All of the people, were trying to hide. When the earth started shakin' and the moon turned to blood. The sun was Black in the last days ..  sure to make you lose your mind. Life in the last days .. yeah, yeah. Life in the last days .. everything prophesied Life in the last days .. uh huh So much to tell you;. I've got one verse. Man didn't heed the stop signs.  And the earth got worse and worse. If you're a Christian, baby, don't you fear a single thing.  If you're not, go read the Bible 'cause there's more than I can sing. There's a false messiah, they'll think that he's the Christ.  The world will take his number, but they'll have to pay his price. They'll look up and they'll see Jesus. and they'll know that they've lost.  He won the war when He was dyin' on the cross.     </segment1>
