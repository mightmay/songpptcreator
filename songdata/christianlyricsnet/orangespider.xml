		<segment1>A note we wrote the other day. to any mice who pass this way. on crumed and sugared countertop: </segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;we must insist. your traffic STOP.&quot; </segment2>
		<segment3>in their defense, they don't refuse. but nonetheless we've come to use. snapping traps and poison beans. (far less diplomatic means). orange spider, orange leaf. confirms my deepest held belief.     </segment3>
