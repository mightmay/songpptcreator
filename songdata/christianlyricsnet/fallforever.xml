		<segment1>who was I fooling?. I still had your name burned in my heart. when my lips where lying. you still seemed to know my every thought. every nightfall's like a reflection. of the debt of love I owe to you. every morning rings like a phone call. saying &quot;when will you be home?&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. I see your arms stretched wide. I think I'll lay my burdens here. I could just fall forever. I could just fall forever here</segment2>
		<segment3>shame overwhelms me. every trial I put you through. how could I take back. all the insults hurled at you?. every night you call went unanswered. every day I heard and ran</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. I see your arms stretched wide. longing to hold this broken child. I could just fall forever. I could just fall forever here     </segment4>
