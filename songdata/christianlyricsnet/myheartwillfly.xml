		<segment1>Why this happened I cannot explain. Why write the script with such heartache and pain. Could there not have been an easier way</segment1>
		<segment2>Watching life through this glass so faded. I cannot see the bigger picture taking place. Oh to understand one day</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. My heart will fly. When I finally see you face to face. And my tears will fly. Away, away</segment3>
		<segment4>It wont be long until we all go home. With all things revealed and on that day well finally know. Oh, as we are fully known</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. And what appears as incomplete. Is still completely Yours. And one day well see as weve been seen. And well soar</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus    </segment7>
