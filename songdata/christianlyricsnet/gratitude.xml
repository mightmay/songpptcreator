		<segment1>Get up get up get up. With the gratitude. Get up get up get up. Like this. So what the hecht do you think that you can talk to me?. As a matter of fact this band that we have means more to me. Than I could understand. It's sorta like Jell-O the longer we hang. We edify each other and build that thang. Unitin' lovin' countin' for each other's own. One of the many things that I'm thankful for. Whoa whoa. I sing a simple song for You. Gotta gotta get it get it get it gratitude. A song of gratitude. If you think that luck had started it all. Think again my friend. It's the God without an end. He hyped and saved my dirty dingee soul. Then He gave me a microphone. An inside to show. Now bring it on Mr. Pigeon John. And tell the people how you get your gratitude on. Wait wait wait oh shoot. Look at me real cute. Gotta switch my attitude to gratitude. And thank the Lord for my friends and my crew. All the ups and the downs in this big life stew. And it gets kinda confusing sometimes. But we gotta let it slide and let the sun shine. Oh Kay you made the beds and washed the socks. Pops you put the bacon on the table. You gave me a name I live with it proud. And jump in the crowd and let it shine. And what's mine is a gift. You know we come to lift heads and emotions. To serve one Master with devotion    </segment1>
