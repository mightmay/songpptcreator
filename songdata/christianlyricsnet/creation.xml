		<segment1>You don't understand my views, or what it is I see. Nothing you say is news cause you wouldn't listen to me. You take my words out of context, your message of wrong is right. What are you gonna tell us next, that dark is day not light? </segment1>
		<segment2>Creation! is proof enough for me. Something that's there for everyone to see </segment2>
		<segment3>You watch the wrong example then conclude a falacy. Your hasty generalization is there for all to see. My actions you speak of is easier said than done. The hope that God see's in you has got you on the run.     </segment3>
