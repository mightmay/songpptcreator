		<segment1>She, she said to me remember when the sunshine left us clean. Oh, she wants to know do you remember letting go. We let the hour come and steal away the light..</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, my frail will takes along another chance to kill. Hatred in your hand couldn't I have been a simple man. We let the hour come steal away the light. and then it kicked my sober face into the night</segment2>
		<segment3>She, she said to me remember when the sunshine left us clean. Oh, she wants to know do you remember letting go. We let the hour come steal away the light. and then it kicked my sober face into the night. Oh woe am I come wash away my sin. and let me open up this door against the wind.     </segment3>
