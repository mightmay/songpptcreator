		<segment1>Lately I've been busy thinkin'. And this is what's been on my mind. It seems like all I do is work for You, Lord. But I feel empty on the inside </segment1>
		<segment2>I know that work is an important part. Oh but this is also true. My dilemma is an issue of the heart. When I try to live for you without you </segment2>
		<segment3>I don't need to try to be. The flawless example. Lifted up for everyone to see. I don't need to stand and shout it. &quot; Hey I've got the answer!&quot;. If your presence is living in me. I won't need to talk about it. In a church committee. For the world to know the truth. All I need to do is just be me. Being in love with you </segment3>
		<segment4>I've been spending all my time. And all my efforts trying. to make you proud of what you see. But to my great surprise. I have realized. Nothing that I do can change your love for me    </segment4>
