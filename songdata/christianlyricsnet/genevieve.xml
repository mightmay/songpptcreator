		<segment1>She reaches for her latest reading. Her pillow's folded. Her mind is reeling round</segment1>
		<segment2>She can't remember. What made this different. Before her clock was. Fifteen minutes fast</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). When the morning came. It was just the same. Genevieve. Like a loaded gun. Like a letter bomb. Genevieve</segment3>
		<segment4>She reaches for her latest feeling. She can't control it. Her heart is beating. She made her mind up. It's off to sleep now. To dream about the book she just put down</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)    </segment5>
