		<segment1>Watch somebody fall from grace. When there's nobody there to take their place. You can't help but feel alone </segment1>
		<segment2>You left guilt in your own device. There was no one there to tell you to think twice. You can't help but feel alone </segment2>
		<segment3>All the times we were losing sight. There's eternal, there's no light alone. It could be someone you know </segment3>
		<segment4>The times we felt all the pain is real. We couldn't help the way we feel, come on. This could be someone you know </segment4>
		<segment5>This life keeps calling (this life). This life keeps calling on and on. This life keeps calling (this life). This life, it keeps calling on and on </segment5>
		<segment6>Take my soul I. Take my soul I. Break my heart I'm. Ready ready ready when you are. Take my soul I. Break my heart I'm. Ready ready ready </segment6>
		<segment7>You watch somebody turn away. You've waited all of your life to see one day. You can't help but feel alone </segment7>
		<segment8>And all the times we were losing sight. There's no shadows there's no light, come on. This could be someone you know </segment8>
		<segment9>This life keeps calling (this life). This life keeps calling on and on. This life keeps calling (this life). This life, it keeps calling on and on </segment9>
		<segment10>Take my soul I. Take my soul I. Break my heart I'm. Ready ready ready when you are. Take my soul I. Break my heart I'm. Ready ready ready when you are. Ready ready ready!. Ready ready ready when you are. Ready ready ready!.     </segment10>
