		<segment1>I know where I am going, because I choose to live in the light, and I know I will struggle, but I have God by my side. Evil is all around me, testing me to do what's wrong, but I will not back away, for God has made me strong. God has saved me from my pain, and for Him I will stand. I've been made new, by the blood that was shed. I've been made strong, by His power over death.</segment1>
		<segment2>I will stand strong to His name. I will stand strong without shame. I will stand strong in the midst of pain. For to live is to die, and to die is to gain.    </segment2>
