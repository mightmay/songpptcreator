		<segment2>all my friends are lonely. they left me only. minutes in the hole. so i'll fake a listen. sneak a kiss in. but only love is gold</segment2>
		<segment3>and i see you from afar. i know who you are. i can tell you all apart</segment3>
		<segment4>would you marry me. so we'll be free. for a lovely day. would you care to fall. and selll us all. and would you laugh along the way</segment4>
		<segment5>and i see you from afar. i know who you are. i can tell you all apart</segment5>
		<segment6>if you leave it to me she said. you're asking the world. and if you take it from me instead. who will you owe</segment6>
		<segment7>wouldn't i be freezing. but so alive. if i killed another day. thought i've never fallen. still you mention often. that i wanted to be saved</segment7>
		<segment8>and i see you from afar. i know who you are. i can tell you all apart</segment8>
		<segment9>if you leave it to me she said. you're asking the world. and if you take it from me instead. who will you owe</segment9>
		<segment10>i caught my hand in the door again. what is it for. if you leave it to me she said. who will you owe    </segment10>
