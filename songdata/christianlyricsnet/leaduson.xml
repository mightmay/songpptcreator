		<segment1>Trade our human dreams. For what we cannot see. What our hands can hold. For eternal things. Give our moments for. Endless glory </segment1>
		<segment2>Cause we wanna be the ones who. follow where You lead. We are believing there is more that. we've not seen </segment2>
		<segment3>So lead us on, lead us on. To light and revelation. Lead us on, lead us on oh Lord. Lead us on, to Your heart. Your purpose and Your passion. Lead us on, to Your heart oh Lord </segment3>
		<segment4>. Cause we wanna be the ones who. follow where You lead. Cause we wanna be the ones who. hear You when You speak. We are believing there is more that. we've not seen    </segment4>
