		<segment1>Did you wake up on the right or the wrong side of the bed today?. Maybe your mornings running right on time or a little late. Head out. Traffics slow on the interstate. Take the back way. Will this be a good or a bad day?. Well dont you worry</segment1>
		<segment2>I could be your sunshine girl. Or the company for your misery. I could be the quiet one. Or the life of the party. Whatever you need, Im your girl</segment2>
		<segment3>When you show up does everybody smile and wave or look away?. Are you feeling beautiful or is this a bad hair day?. Maybe youre falling so in love or your heart is about to break. Will this be a good or a bad day?. Well either way</segment3>
		<segment4>Go ahead, freak out. Im gonna stay. So if youre happy or sad, well baby, you can look my way.     </segment4>
