		<segment1>FROM HEAVEN YOU CAME, Helpless babe, Entered our world, Your glory veiled;. Not to be served. But to serve, And give Your life. That we might live. </segment1>
		<segment2>This is our God, The Servant King, He calls us now. To follow Him, To bring our lives. As a daily offering. Of worship to. The Servant King. </segment2>
		<segment3>There in the garden. Of tears, My heavy load. He chose to bear;. His heart with sorrow. Was torn, 'Yet not My will. But Yours,' He said. </segment3>
		<segment4>Come see His hands. And His feet, The scars that speak. Of sacrifice;. Hands that flung stars. Into space. To cruel nails. Surrendered. </segment4>
		<segment5>So let us learn. How to serve, And in our lives. Enthrone Him;. Each other's needs. To prefer, For it is Christ. We're serving. </segment5>
