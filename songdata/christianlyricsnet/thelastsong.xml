		<segment1>I'm sorry for needing. You to carry me. So simple sometimes. When you're standing next to me</segment1>
		<segment2>You never change. You never stay the same. Like a picture-perfect sunrise. Every time with one last song to sing</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Take it all away from me. And tell me how you want this to be. I want you. I need you. x2</segment3>
		<segment4>A life without you. Made me wonder why i'm here. Until i found you. Nothing ever seemed so clear</segment4>
		<segment5>You never change. You never stay the same. Like a picture-perfect sunrise. Every time with one last song to sing</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>I lose myself in everything you say. I lose myself in everything..</segment7>
		<segment8>Never knew that i could feel this way. never knew that i could feel..</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus</segment9>
		<segment10>I lose myself in everything you say. (You say) x4    </segment10>
