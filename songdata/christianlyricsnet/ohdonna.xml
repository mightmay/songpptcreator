		<segment1>Oh Donna, Oh Donna Oh Donna, Oh Donna. I had a girl. Donna was her name. Since she left me, I've never been the same. 'Cause I love my girl. Donna, where can you be?. Where can you be?. Now that you're gone and I'm left all alone. All by myself to wonder and groan. 'Cause I love my girl. Donna, where can you be?. Darling, now that you're gone, I don't know what I'll do. Yeah and time had all my love, for you. Oh Donna, Oh Donna. Oh Donna, Oh Donna. I had a girl. Donna was her name. Since she left me, I've never been the same. 'Cause I love my girl. Donna, where can you be?. Where can you be?. Oh Donna, Oh Donna. Oh Donna, Oh Donna. Oh Donna, Oh Donna. Oh Donna, Oh Donna    </segment1>
