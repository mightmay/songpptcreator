		<segment1>What do you think of. In your room at night while eyes turned over. And wonder through night skies</segment1>
		<segment2>Do you stay up. And stare at glowing wires. You've said it now. The moon's gone and left me alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Did you even notice that those words were in my heart. Could have stayed forever in this word of joy and. I won't be long now. I don't belong</segment3>
		<segment4>So alone, alone. I know it's wrong. I waited an hour for you</segment4>
		<segment5>Recall the memory of one dream. Where all I wanted was. Ice cream and caramel wings</segment5>
		<segment6>Did you even notice that those words were in my heart. Could have stayed forever if you weren't apart. Didn't know I waited for this day to end up right where we started. But I know it won't</segment6>
		<segment7>So alone, alone (To see against the wind, I won't). I know it's wrong (But I won't pray). I waited an hour for you (It's falling down around, like me)</segment7>
		<segment8>I can't stop wondering. And I won't sleep knowing. I'll wake    </segment8>
