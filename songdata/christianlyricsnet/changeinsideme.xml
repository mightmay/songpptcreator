		<segment1>Pardon me. If I've been acting strange. I haven't been myself lately. What you see. Is a person rearranged. Someone affected me greatly. And I've got so much to say. Ever since Jesus looked my way</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Gonna raise my voice like thunder. And leave the world in wonder of the change. The change inside of me. And I will never stop believing. That you are the reason for this change. The change inside of me</segment2>
		<segment3>Everyday. I'm taking in the view. Of His glory around me. I'm awake. And I have been made new. By the One who has found me. Words just can't say enough. When all I can feel is love</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Your life You gave for mine to save. Its nothing less than a miracle. Your name I praise, because the change. Inside of me is so beautiful</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus 2x)    </segment6>
