		<segment1>To the faithless You are faithful. To the broken You are able. To the captives You are liberty. To the orphan You are Father. To the widow You are a lover. To the blind You are eyes to see</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. God of grace. You took our place. You love us where we are, all the weak and broken sing,  we love You God of grace</segment2>
		<segment3>To the homeless You are shelter. To the thirsty living water. To the lame You give them feet to dance</segment3>
		<segment4>To the helpless You are a brother. To the hungry You are bread. and to all sinners You are second chance</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Merciful in all Your ways. How could we cease to sing Your praise. You became sin for us. Oh how precious is Your love</segment5>
		<segment6>And now redeemed Your children sing we love You God of Grace. Bells will ring Your bride will sing we love You God of Grace    </segment6>
