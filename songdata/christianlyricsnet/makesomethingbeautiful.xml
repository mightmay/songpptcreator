		<segment1>Verse 1: </segment1>
		<segment2>When Im at the point of breaking at the place where I resign, And Im at the stage of shaking my head as I look back on my life, When Im halfway through the grieving, but not quite through the ache, When I cannot see the ending, Or which road Im supposed to take, All i know to do is lift my hands to you.</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Take all of my life, all of my life, All I know to do is lift my hands to You. And make something beautiful. I open my hand, trusting Your plan. Make something beautiful so all will see. Your work in me, as You make something beautiful</segment3>
		<segment4>. Verse 2: When Im tired of pretending, and I cant recall my lines, Do I say, Im barely breathing., or just say, Im doing fine. I admit there is a yearning, for the hurting to subside, But not at the risk of missing what Your doing with my life. All i know to do is lift my hands to you    </segment4>
