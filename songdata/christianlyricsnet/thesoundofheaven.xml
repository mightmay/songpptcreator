		<segment1>There is a sound, Sound of hope, Sound of love, Drawing all to come,</segment1>
		<segment2>There is a sound, Sound of joy, Sound of peace, Flowing out of me,</segment2>
		<segment3>Sound to heal the broken heart, Comfort for the least of these, Justice for the lawless. Righteousness and ever flowing stream, For the fatherless the widows and the orphans,</segment3>
		<segment4>To hear the sound, We will release the sound of heaven,</segment4>
		<segment5>They're crying, They're seeking, They're searching, For the sound of heaven,</segment5>
		<segment6>They're calling, They're watching, They're waiting, For the sound of heaven,</segment6>
		<segment7>They're hungry, They're thirsty, They're desperate, For the sound of heaven,</segment7>
		<segment8>We will release the sound, We will release the sound, We will release the sound, Of heaven. (repeat until end)    </segment8>
