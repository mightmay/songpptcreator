		<segment1>Bob Hartman. Mark 16:15</segment1>
		<segment2>You never tried to win more secular appeal. And water down Your message with a slightly different feel. You never tried to be politically correct. Or skirt around the issue attempting to connect</segment2>
		<segment3>You spoke the truth in love so faithfully. You expect no less from me</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). It's a sacred trust that You gave to us. To take Your Word into all the world. It's a sacred trust that You gave to us. The message of salvation and Your love</segment4>
		<segment5>You never shied away from critical debate. Or beat around the bushes when discussing human fate. You weren't ashamed to tell them who Your Father was. Never ran from persecution like human nature does</segment5>
		<segment6>You prayed for all believers on Your knees. Then you handed us the keys</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>You're trusting us to be bold. The story has to be told. To every nation and tongue. Young and old. I'm gonna shout from the hill. How could I ever be still?. I'm gonna let the chips fall. Where they will</segment8>
		<segment9>You spoke the truth in love so faithfully. You expect no less from me</segment9>
		<segment10>(Chorus).     </segment10>
