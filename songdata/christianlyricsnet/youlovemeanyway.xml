		<segment1>The question was raised. As my conscience fell. A silly, little lie. It didnt mean much. But it lingers still. In the corners of my mind</segment1>
		<segment2>Still you call me to walk. On the edge of this world. To spread my dreams and fly. But the futures so far. My heart is so frail. I think Id rather stay inside</segment2>
		<segment3>But You love me anyway. Its like nothing in life that Ive ever known. You love me anyway. Oh Lord, how You love me. How You love me</segment3>
		<segment4>It took more than my strength. To simply be still. To seek but never find. All the reasons we change. The reasons I doubt. And why do loved ones have to die?</segment4>
		<segment5>But You love me anyway. Its like nothing in life that Ive ever known. You love me anyway. Oh Lord, how You love me</segment5>
		<segment6>I am the thorn in Your crown. But You love me anyway. I am the sweat from Your brow. But You love me anyway. I am the nail in Your wrist. But You love me anyway. I am Judas kiss. But You love me anyway</segment6>
		<segment7>See now, I am the man that called out from the crowd. For Your blood to be spilled on this earth shaking ground. Yes then, I turned away with this smile on my face. With this sin in my heart tried to bury Your grace. And then alone in the night, I still called out for You. So ashamed of my life, my life, my life</segment7>
		<segment8>But You love me anyway. Oh, God how you love me</segment8>
		<segment9>You love me anyway. Its like nothing in life that Ive ever known. You love me anyway. Oh Lord, how You love me</segment9>
		<segment10>You love me, You love me. You love me, You love me. How You love me. How You love me. How You love me    </segment10>
