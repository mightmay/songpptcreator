		<segment1>Mildred Madalyn Johnson. Born in the autumn of 1916 </segment1>
		<segment2>A shy, pretty girl from East Texas. Religious and restless. Humble and kind as a person could be </segment2>
		<segment3>She loved to sing in the choir. Loud and inspired. Her head tilted down, keeping time </segment3>
		<segment4>Or tell stories with friends after supper. Ignoring the hour. A calico cat fast asleep at her side </segment4>
		<segment5>And she loved to drive. Her big red car. Though she couldn't see over. The hood very far. She'd back out the driveway. And point that thing down the road. We'd say, Lord, there she goes </segment5>
		<segment6>Her hair was silver and messy. She walked in a hurry. Worried about wasting the day </segment6>
		<segment7>Some nights she sat at her dresser. Composing long letters. Falling asleep with a pen in her hand </segment7>
		<segment8>And she loved to drive. Her big red car. A scarf round her shoulders. Her foot to the floor. Down to the grocery. She'd wave good-bye. And we'd pray. Lord, bring her back safe. </segment8>
		<segment9>And she loved to drive. Her big red car. Though she couldn't see over. The hood very far. She'd back out the driveway. And point that thing down the road. We'd say, Lord, there she goes </segment9>
		<segment10>Mildred Madalyn Johnson. Marvelous woman. I was so lucky. To call her my friend    </segment10>
