		<segment1>Words and music by Greg X. Volz</segment1>
		<segment2>Let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Let every creature under God's sun praise the Lord. Let all the mountains, let all the valleys. Let all the hillsides sing of His glory. Let everything that has breath praise the Lord </segment2>
		<segment3>Israel had a war to fight but the Lord showed them the secret. He said the battle this day is mine, but you must listen how to do it. Put your singers first in front of the rest. Let them praise and sing to me. And you will see the salvation of your God. And watch your enemies flee </segment3>
		<segment4>Paul and Silas were thrown in jail. For preaching the gospel of Christ. Though in chains they praised His name singing songs in the night. Just then an earthquake shook the place and the chains and the doors were loosened. Then the jailer ran in scared to death and that day he found salvation     </segment4>
