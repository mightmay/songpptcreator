		<segment1>What if the armies of the Lord. Picked up and dusted off their swords. Vowed to set the captives free. And not let satan have one more</segment1>
		<segment2>What if the church, for heaven's sake. Finally stepped up to the plate. Took a stand upon God's promise. And stormed hell's rusty gates</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: What if His people prayed. And those who bear His name. Would humbly seek His face Yeah. And Turn from their own way</segment3>
		<segment4>And what would happen if we prayed. For those raised up to lead the way. Then maybe kids in school could pray. And unborn children see light of day</segment4>
		<segment5>What if the life that we pursue. Came from a hunger for the truth. What if the family turned to Jesus. Stopped asking Oprah what to do</segment5>
		<segment6>What if His people prayed. And those who bear His name. Would humbly seek His face Yeah. And Turn from their own way</segment6>
		<segment7>He said that they would hear. His promise has been made. He'll answer loud and clear. If only we would pray</segment7>
		<segment8>If My people called by My name. If they'll humble themselves and pray. If My people called by My name. If they'll humble themselves and pray.     </segment8>
