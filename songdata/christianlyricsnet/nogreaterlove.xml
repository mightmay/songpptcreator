		<segment1>On a hill. There was a cross. And all was lost. In need of a Savior</segment1>
		<segment2>There You were. Arms stretched wide, crucified. No love could be greater. Than when You laid down Your life</segment2>
		<segment3>Who am I that You would come and die?. I don't understand. Why the God of all the universe. Would become a man</segment3>
		<segment4>To redeem the mess that I have made. Take away the shame. Of what I've done. There is no, no greater love</segment4>
		<segment5>Every sin. That held me down. Is lifted now. Because of Your mercy</segment5>
		<segment6>Here I stand, forgiven and free. Grace covers me. Though I'm so unworthy. But You laid down Your life</segment6>
		<segment7>Who am I that You would come and die?. I don't understand. Why the God of all the universe. Would become a man</segment7>
		<segment8>To redeem the mess that I have made. Take away the shame. Of what I've done. There is no, no greater love</segment8>
		<segment9>What love that You would give. Your life that I might live</segment9>
		<segment10>Who am I that You would come and die?. I don't understand. Why the God of all the universe. Would become a man</segment10>
		<segment11>To redeem the mess that I have made. Take away the shame. Of what I've done. There is no, no greater love</segment11>
		<segment12>No greater love    </segment12>
