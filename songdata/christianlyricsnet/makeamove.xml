		<segment1>Mr. Good Intentions, so much I wanna do. My mouth just keeps on running. But I never follow through. I heard that true religion is love with hands and feet. I wanna find my own way. To reach a world in need. Ive been captured by the unimportant. Locked in and now its time to break free</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Theres more to life. Open my eyes. Someone is needing you. So I gotta make a move. What good are words. When this world hurts. Real faith will come through. When I make a move</segment2>
		<segment3>We dont need permission to go outside of these doors. And dream some crazy dream. No one else has dreamed before. To show love and compassion. Whatever way it may be. To put faith into action. Do more than just believe. We are hope to those who have been broken. We were made to make a difference</segment3>
		<segment4>Ive been captured by the unimportant. Locked in and now its time to break free. Now its time to break free    </segment4>
