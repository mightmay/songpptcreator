		<segment1>Empty reasons for my past. Excuses do not hold. I'm struck with my affliction. An inner perfect storm. Why didn't someone warn me. To save me from my self. The pain is self inflicted. The decisions were my own </segment1>
		<segment2>Now listen to history </segment2>
		<segment3>[CHORUS:]. There's so much I could say. There's so much that I've learned don't make my mistake. There's no time to delay. Take my hand and learn from my heartache </segment3>
		<segment4>Take a look into the past see all the things I've tried. Looking for a truth inside but only finding pain </segment4>
		<segment5>See these deep and painful scars, cutting to the bone. Do you want to look like me? With a broken, empty life </segment5>
		<segment6>[BRIDGE:]. Some things you may never understand. But knowledge from lessons not your own. Can save you from the unknown which may stop your fall.     </segment6>
