		<segment1>You need a place where you can find some shelter. Follow me there, follow me there. You want a hand to hold someone to help you. Follow me there, come on, follow me there. Where love, like a river flows, peace like youve never known and joy never ending lives. A place where faith can find hope that will never die. Follow me there, come on, follow me there. Where you can lay down all those burdens you carry. Follow me there, follow me there. Where the lost can find salvation and the lonely finds a friend. Where the sinner finds forgiveness. Wont you follow me there, wont you follow me there    </segment1>
