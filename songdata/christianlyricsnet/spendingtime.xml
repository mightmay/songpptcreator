		<segment1>Just so happens that my schedule is empty. But still there's no room for You. The time has come and gone. Things have come along that take me away from you</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't take this the wrong way. You're so perfect. And everything tells me. You're so worth it</segment2>
		<segment3>Spending time with You. Not a moment goes by that You're not by my side. Spending time with You. You're all that I want life is so hard to do</segment3>
		<segment4>When we first met I remember I'd do anything for You. But as the years go by. I let my attentions slide. And I'm pulling away from You    </segment4>
