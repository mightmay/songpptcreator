		<segment1>We come into Your presence with singing. Come into Your presence with praise. And enter Your gates with thankful hearts. We are going to celebrate</segment1>
		<segment2>All of heavens waiting. Power is on its way. So we shout hallelujah. Lifting to You a mighty roar of praise</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: You deserve the highest praise. That we can give and more. Lord, we give You our praise. Thats what we came here for</segment3>
		<segment4>(Verse)</segment4>
		<segment5>Everything within me reaches out to You. Your power and majesty. Grace and mercy too. Therell be singing and dancing. Hearts and voices raised. You have set Your people free. Now the house is filled with praise. (Chorus)     </segment5>
