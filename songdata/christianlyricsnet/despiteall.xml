		<segment1>Some things are meant to be broken, so I can find my way back to you. Cause I feel in love, I feel alive, when you speak so deep into my soul. And if others could know who I was inside, they'd all turn away by now. But you are one who sees my thoughts from afar, so why do you still long.</segment1>
		<segment2>To embrace me, He longs to have you, He'll kiss your tears away. He longs for you to call him father, he could be your best friend. And now I can see, that His love is the only love in the world that is unconditional.</segment2>
		<segment3>Something's got me holding on to you. Despite my doubts you have me falling in love with you. Though with all my faults in front of you.</segment3>
		<segment4>You long to embrace me, you long to have me, you'll kiss my tears away. You long for me to call you father, you could be my best friend. And now I can see, that your love is the only love in the world that is unconditional.     </segment4>
