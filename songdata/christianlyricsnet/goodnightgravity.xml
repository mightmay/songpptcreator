		<segment1>Static night, I'll be leaving soon. It won't be long, no it won't be long. Cause I'm wearing out under nowhere's moon. It won't be long, no it won't be long. Until I see the sun splash up the night sky. And call it out to turn the planet new</segment1>
		<segment2>So goodnight gravity. It has kept me down. But I always get just one more try. I always get just one more try</segment2>
		<segment3>Space between, there is such a divide. It won't be long, no it won't be long. Cause honestly there's a storm inside. It won't be long, no it won't be long. Cause honestly there's a storm inside. It won't be long, no it won't be long</segment3>
		<segment4>And in the morning I will find my heart. And in the morning I will find my heart    </segment4>
