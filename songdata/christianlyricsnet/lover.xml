		<segment1>I am a lover. I am a shame. I am appalled by what I fame. I am a lover, but Ive had my share. Of flirting with the darkest affairs</segment1>
		<segment2>You can find me here with my head against the wall. Lost in my regrets and every time I fall. You catch me in Your hands. You circle me like a wedding band</segment2>
		<segment3>I have a lover. Faithful and true. Cares for me in all that I do. I have a lover. My song You have sung. With love on Your lips and grace on Your tongue</segment3>
		<segment4>A promise from Heaven. A promise from You. A promise to love, I will hold onto </segment4>
		<segment5>God of new beginnings to You I cry, Teach me how to love. Teach me how to die.. In death theres forgiveness. And forgiveness calls on new life!.     </segment5>
