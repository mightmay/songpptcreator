		<segment1>I've been forgiven. I've been set free. Restored and sanctified. In Christ I've been released. And I am free. The stone's been rolled away. And I am free. The stone's been rolled away</segment1>
		<segment2>I've been delivered. I've been released. Been washed and purified. My God has set me free. I've been released. The stone's been rolled away. I've been released. The stone's been rolled away</segment2>
		<segment3>Singing glory. Singing glory. Singing glory. Restored and sanctified. The stone's been rolled away    </segment3>
