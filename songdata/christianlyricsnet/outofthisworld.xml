		<segment1>Take stock of your life. What's wrong and what's right. Empty pockets, got no green. Don't you know sunshine is free. What breaks have you had. Some good and some bad. Wanna go but got no car. Dreaming dreams can take you far</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You will find that life's worth living. In this world, it's out of this world. With a little love and a little giving. In this world, it's out of this world</segment2>
		<segment3>Look ot the future. Who's in the picture. Say your love life's just a dream. Still you've got a friend in me</segment3>
		<segment4>Today, tomorrow. Laughter and sorrow. Gonna be some lows and highs. Might as well enjoy the ride</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)    </segment5>
