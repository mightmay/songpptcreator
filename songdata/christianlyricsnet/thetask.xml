		<segment1>it is ongoing, I will never cease to give you my love, there are many outside. who try to intrude and disrupt, will you cast your magic dust on me will they breathe it into my lungs. will you show them your mercy if they give you their hearts,</segment1>
		<segment2>my mission wont fail, I will not look astray</segment2>
		<segment3>you won't sell out to me, you've got me hooked to your line, keep pulling me toward you and I won't turn away (or blink)</segment3>
		<segment4>you won't sell out to me, you've got me hooked to your line, keep pulling me toward you and I won't turn away (or blink)</segment4>
		<segment5>my love for you is like a prison, my devotion is sealed away so tight. my love for you is like a prision. my love for you. my heart for you. my mission was failed. I will not look upset    </segment5>
