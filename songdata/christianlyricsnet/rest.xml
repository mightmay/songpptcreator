		<segment1>To all who are weary and those who are heavy laden. Lay at the feet of the one who loves you best. Bring all of your trials and all of your tribulation. Come unto me and I will give you rest </segment1>
		<segment2>I will give you rest </segment2>
		<segment3>Take my yoke upon you. Come and learn from me. For I am humble in spirit and so you must also be. Lo I will be with you in the midst of every test. If you run unto me, I will give you rest </segment3>
		<segment4>I will give you rest    </segment4>
