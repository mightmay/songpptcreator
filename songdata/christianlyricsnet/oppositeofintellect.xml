		<segment1>It seems so hard to get away from last week and yesterday. I have to sit right here and watch it all go by. Is this really happening? maybe this is just a dream. When I wake up ill be someone else. I don't want to grow up, not just yet. I don't wanna have to see your false sence of reality. I don't wanna grow up, not just yet. I don't wanna have to know how to play in your game show. Just don't ask me if you're getting thru to me. Just don't tell me the way that you want me to be. You say ill fit nicely in society. You only took a superficial look at me. Why can't I say I'm sick of you? is it wrong to say what's true?. I'm skeptical about your point of view. Teaching us not to reflect, the opposite of intellect. Don't resist authority and you'll be fine. You don't want me to speak my mind.     </segment1>
