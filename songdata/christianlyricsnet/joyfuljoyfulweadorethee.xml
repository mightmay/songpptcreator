		<segment1>Jon Mohr. II Timothy 4:7-8</segment1>
		<segment2>We're pilgrims on the journey. Of the narrow road. And those who've gone before us line the way. Cheering on the faithful, encouraging the weary. Their lives a stirring testament to God's sustaining grace</segment2>
		<segment3>Surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us run the race not only for the prize. But as those who've gone before us. Let us leave to those behind us. The heritage of faithfulness passed on through godly lives</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful. May the fire of our devotion light their way. May the footprints that we leave. Lead them to believe. And the lives we live inspire them to obey. Oh may all who come behind us find us faithful</segment4>
		<segment5>After all our hopes and dreams have come and gone. And our children sift though all we've left behind. May the clues that they discover and the memories they uncover. Become the light that leads them to the road we each must find</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>&quot;Ask faith to look through the keyhole of the promise and tell. you what it sees there laid up for him that overcomes; ask it to. listen and tell you whether it cannot hear the shout of those. crowned saints receiving the reward of all their services and. sufferings here on earth. And do you stand on the other side. afraid to wet your foot with those sufferings and temptations, which, like a little trickle of water, run between you and. glory?&quot;    </segment7>
