		<segment1>Violence, hate, and rage they infiltrate my thoughts. I've had it with this world and I don't need your God. Hypocrites and liars that's all you really are. Religionists and lunatics I've seen it from afar. Yeah!. An offer of salvation, a choice of yes or no. Acceptance or rejection, no other way to go. In choosing your eternity, if Jesus you deny, you lived your life in blindness, yes, you believed the lie. Yeah!. Chorus: Fatal Delay. Don't wait to long. Fatal Delay. To choose where you belong. (x2). Blinding light engulfs me as I enter in. My Judgement now approaches, &quot;Oh God please let me in!&quot;. My choice it was my failure, I know now as I rot, I cry out to my Maker, but His ears they hear me not. Yeah!. Chorus: Fatal Delay. You waited way to long. Fatal Delay. To choose where you belong. (x2). To see that you were wrong, you were wrong. (Joshua 24:15, John 3)    </segment1>
