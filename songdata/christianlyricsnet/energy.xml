		<segment1>You made the world. Created time. You spoke into the darkness. It exploded in light</segment1>
		<segment2>Out of the ground. You formed a man. By Your breath. All life began</segment2>
		<segment3>I could never understand that kind of power if I tried. And how You use it to transform my life</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). I can feel your energy. You are my life. The current runnin' through my veins. You're the power inside of me. When I am weak. Fill me with your energy</segment4>
		<segment5>There are days. I'm feelin the crunch. Trying hard to figure out. How to live up</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll never deserve. The gift that you gave. Of how You love me in a million ways</segment6>
		<segment7>Without You there my world would stop and fall from space. There's nothing more electric than Your grace</segment7>
		<segment8>(Bridge). Deep enough to last forever. Strong enough to change a heart. Big enough to change the universe. It measures off the charts.     </segment8>
