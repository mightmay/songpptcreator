		<segment1>Although I'll never deserve it. I realize that You will give me all of Your love. I couldn't ever return it. I know that I could never give You reason enough. Your love came over me. You found the way to my heart. Chorus. Tell me why. What have I done. I got You. Now You'll always be the one. Tell me how. Can this be true. I'm with You. Now I really wanna know. Tell me why. Let everybody believe it. I want the world to see the kind of love that we've got. Deep down in me I can feel it. I'm gonna give You all I have and no matter what. Your love came over me. You found the way to my heart. Chorus. I'm gonna wait no longer. To show how I really feel. My love is growing stronger. You're all that I need. You are my love for life. Nothing can tear us apart </segment1>
