		<segment1>There will come a time when the. skies will open.There will come. a time when all men's hearts are. broken.The return of my King. drawas near.The footsteps of. His horses I can almost hear-. Pledge to follow HIm hereafter, trade my sorrow for HIs laoughter. O my Lord don't be too. long.I'm waiting,watching and. I&quot;m wondering will You carry. us right past the lightining and. the thundering In your chariot?. I'm wating watching and I'm. wondering will you carry us. to Your throne above in Your. chariot?There will come a time. wehne the blind will see.There. will come a time when the captives. are set free.And all the dead. in Christ will arise.My Lord and. Reedemer will descend from the. skies..Swing lo, sweet Chariot. coming for to carry me home. Carry me Home!..    </segment1>
