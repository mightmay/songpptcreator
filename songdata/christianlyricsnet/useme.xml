		<segment1>Its been a long time comin. Ive laid around this old town for years. And Lord its time that I stop runnin. From the very voice that summoned me here. I cant hide Your calling forever. Start a fire in my soul. Cause Lord Im ready, and willing. To give You my all, You just. . CHORUS: Give me a vision, show me a sign. Tell me You love me like the very first time. Youve got the power and Ive got the need. Im standing before You. Father just use me. . Ive lived a lifetime of mercy. Hard-headed, and set in my ways. And if Ive hurt You, dear God. Im sorry. I took for granted Your amazing grace. But if theres one chance in a million. You could reach one soul through me. Then father Im ready, and able. To answer Your call, You just. . Chorus. . Take my hand. Father take my hand. Dont look back. No, theres no lookin back. Jesus start a fire in my soul. Theres a fire in my soul. Im ready, able to give You my all.     </segment1>
