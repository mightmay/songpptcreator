		<segment1>I'd cross the desert to be with you. I miss you, I miss you.</segment1>
		<segment2>I heard the rumors they all were true. I need you, I need you.</segment2>
		<segment3>Oooooh.. Next to me, Next to me.</segment3>
		<segment4>Oooooh.. Next to me, Next to me.</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll take off my make-up, I'll stop and listen. I am alive now, I watch my head spin.</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll take off my make-up, I'll stop and listen. I am alive now, I watch my head spin.</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm in love with things you can't define, And I'm in love with things you cannot buy. All for you, the one thing I know's true. All for you, take me and renew.</segment7>
		<segment8>Into the depths of the deepest sea. I fought you, I fought you.</segment8>
		<segment9>For all I know and all I can see. You come through, You come through.</segment9>
		<segment10>And all I am and all I can be. You're callin, You're callin.</segment10>
		<segment11>So here you are in front of me. I've fallen, I've fallen.</segment11>
		<segment12>I'll take off my make-up, I'll stop and listen. I am alive now, I watch my head spin.</segment12>
		<segment13>I'll take off my make-up, I'll stop and listen. I am alive now, I watch my head spin.</segment13>
		<segment14>Round and Round, the things I can't deny, And I'm in love with things you can't define. All for you, the one thing I know's true. All for you, take me and renew.</segment14>
		<segment15>And I walked away, But you were always on my mind. And I was afraid, That you would never come alive.</segment15>
		<segment16>There for me, And I was scared of you. You were there for me, When I wasn't there for you.</segment16>
		<segment17>I'm in love with things you can't define, And I'm in love with things you cannot buy. All for you, the one thing I know's true. All for you, take me and renew.</segment17>
		<segment18>    </segment18>
