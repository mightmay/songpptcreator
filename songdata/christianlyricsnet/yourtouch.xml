		<segment1>Staring at a blank wall and it's white washed face. Not knowing why i had to choose this way. I decern i was wrong in my way. Looking for peace in another, another domain. And i realize that it's true I seek you. And i realize that it's true I need you. And i reach out and i touch you and i know that i need You. To reach out and to touch me and i know. I know that i need your touch. Not knowing why i ever retreated from Your arms. A mistake i made. Now oh Lord i feel Your warm embrace, contentment. Fills my soul as joy lights my face. And i realize that it's true I seek you. And i realize that it's true I need you. And i reach out and i touch you and i know that i need You. To reach out and to touch me and i know. I know that i need your touch. (whisper) You look into the sky. and see His arms if love reaching out for you. His arms of love and grace. And you know you need Him, you need his touch. I need your, i need your... (rap) i was lost but now i'm found.. And i reach out and i touch you and i know that i need You. To reach out and to touch me and i know. I know that i need your touch     </segment1>
