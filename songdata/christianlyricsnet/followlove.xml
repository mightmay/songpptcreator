		<segment1>I'm gonna miss the simple town full of memories. I'm gonna miss just hanging out with all my friends. The rainy days and summer nights. Skipping stones by the river side. But I know, it's time to go. So..</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). Here's goodbye here's so long. I must go and follow love. I feel my heart moving on. I must go and follow love. Carry on while I'm gone. This is what I've been dreaming of. I miss you so. But I must go, go and follow love</segment2>
		<segment3>I've got a heart that's full of dreams. and a little bit of crazy. I can feel it pulling me to somewhere I have never been. I'm packing up and leaving home. To travel into the great unknown. Its time, I have to go</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>We're not guaranteed tomorrow. So we must just keep on living for the day. And make the most of every moment. Every step along the way, oh</segment5>
