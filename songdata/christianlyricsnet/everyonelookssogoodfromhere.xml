		<segment1>In a deep breath it all starts to change. Flip my world inside out, honestly I like it better this way. When I mesh the night through the back of my eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>I have put myself here. I'm the culprit. I am the culprit</segment2>
		<segment3>I've been swallowed alive. Shut down. Building from the inside out. I can finally walk through the walls</segment3>
		<segment4>I swear I've been slipped right through the cracks in the floor. It's so easy when it's pulling me under</segment4>
		<segment5>Now I can see things from the outside, and I will sit here with no place. In mind</segment5>
		<segment6>I can't escape from this place, this is so unfamiliar to me</segment6>
		<segment7>I can hear the unsatisfying silence. My mouth is open but none of you can hear me</segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
