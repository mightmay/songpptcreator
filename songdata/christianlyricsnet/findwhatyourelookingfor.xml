		<segment1>What would they find if they uncovered all my tracks. Of roads Id snuck down and darkness and never turn back. Well theyd find what theyre looking for. Secrets and so much more. What would they find if they searched for a heart of gold. Theyd find sacrifices of time and money never told. Yeah theyd find what theyre looking for. Kindness and so much more</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Cause theres so much good in the worst of us. So much bad in the best of us. It never makes sense for any of us. To criticize the rest of us. Well just find what were looking for. Well find it and so much more</segment2>
		<segment3>What would I find if I turned back the time on your face. Could I piece together the memories that have made you this way. I might find what Im looking for. Understanding and so much more</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Havent we all learned the best life lessons. By falling and falling down hard. If were looking for somebodys failures. We wont have to look very far</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>What would they find if they uncovered all my tracks    </segment7>
