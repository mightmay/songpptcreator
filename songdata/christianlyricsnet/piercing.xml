		<segment1>Living in fear is not what you had in mind for me. But holding to you is so hard, I cling to what I see</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS(*): In a world where my emotions. Seem to rule my every move. They will challenge my devotion. To seek and know the truth</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Youre piercing me. This self will bleed. Youre killing all of my securities. Lord, help me see the reality. That all Ill ever need is You</segment3>
		<segment4>Here in this haze a distant light seems to draw me near. But in the shadow of my doubt. My faith just disappears</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS(*)</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS(3x)    </segment6>
