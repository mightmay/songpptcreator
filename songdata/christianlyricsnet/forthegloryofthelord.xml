		<segment1>For the glory of the Lord. We have been created. Living text of written Word. Mercy demonstrated. We are made a channel. Where His grace is poured. Witness of salvation. For the glory of the Lord. For the glory of the Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>For the glory of the Lord. Willingly, we suffer. Laid upon this holy cross. Dying with our Brother. His divine fulfillment. Our complete reward. Crucified rejoicing. For the glory of the Lord. For the glory of the Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>For the glory of the Lord. We advance united. Following Christ's blazing sword. His dominion sighted. All that has been taken. It shall be restored. This eternal anthem. For the glory of the Lord. For the glory of the Lord    </segment3>
