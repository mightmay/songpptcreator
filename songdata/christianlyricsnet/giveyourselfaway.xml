		<segment1>You were 25 and careless. You were talking with a scoffer's tongue. Yes, your two-edged sword. Was a throe to everyone. You were following your own desires. You were walking with a mulish gait. And your eyes were blind. To the sorrow on your face. I was making conversation. When I heard it from your mouth. And your words just came. Not knowing what you were talking about. I couldn't help but wander in. You were talking about the kingdom come. You were mesmerizing blind men. You were adding lies. But subtracting from the sum</segment1>
		<segment2>And your life remains the same. And your life remains the same. And your life remains the same. Until you give it away. Until you give your life away</segment2>
		<segment3>So I asked a pertinent question. And I could tell from your haggard gaze. You started looking pale. And your conduct seemed to change. You were blaspheming my Savior. So I had to set the record straight. I wasn't going to leave. Until you heard my faith. You weren't open to discussion. You were stubborn and you shouted out. &quot;If there's a God. Then why can't we just leave him out?&quot;. That was your point of view. I was trying just to get it through. That the only way for freedom. Was the Son of Man to reveal Himself to you</segment3>
		<segment4>So I told you what you needed. You couldn't look me in the eye. Was your pride too deep. Or was that hole in your heart too wide. So you just walked away. You were scared to take that leap of faith. So I'll pray the Spirit leads you. And possibly we'll meet again someday    </segment4>
