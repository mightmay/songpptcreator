		<segment1>I lay on my bed. I try to sleep. my eyes won't close. my mind so deep</segment1>
		<segment2>chorus. you're still there. you still care -. why do you draw me. you never left me</segment2>
		<segment3>time after time I've tried to make it alone. I felt like my life was failure prone. but you're still there. you still care. - you wait and see, you cry for me. why do you draw me. you never left me</segment3>
		<segment4>and when my life it has come to a close. I've run the good race and defeated my foes. you'll be there and you'll still care. you wait and see you cry for me. why did you draw me, you never left me. praise you.     </segment4>
