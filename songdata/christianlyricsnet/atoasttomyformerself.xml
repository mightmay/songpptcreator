		<segment1>With all those thoughts I've left behind. I'm putting to death, no remorse what's pushed inside. With a toast I sigh. I'm sealing the fate of this weight, what's left has died. Goddbye to this child. Taking a piece of a promise that's left for mine. You'll see my eyes start to dry. My loose ends are tied..I see the day bring light</segment1>
		<segment2>Kill the day and fill me, break my past renew me. Lift up my head, I'm weary. Strip my thoughts and I'll..</segment2>
		<segment3>Kill this day, now fill me</segment3>
		<segment4>Bleed out my wounds, Bleed out my wounds. And break free to shed cocoons. My second taste of you is the end. All I need to breathe anew</segment4>
		<segment5>All those ways to choke my neck. I'm turning my back on those hopeless, failed attempts. I see my breath bringing a place that's so long been past as left. But now I know what's next. I'm sealing the fate of my selfish existence. Pushing on with life from death, no questions left. I'm giving my life, no less    </segment5>
