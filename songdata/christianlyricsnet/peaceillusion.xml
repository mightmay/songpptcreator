		<segment1>I do believe. But perverted religions. They all spread like disease. Untrusting and deceived. Governments leading the blind. Controlling society with. NOISE!. PEACE!. ILLUSIONS!. Riots fill our streets. NOISE!. PEACE!. ILLUSIONS!. I have said nothing new. I'm not a revolutionary. I'm not the world's leader. But I'm a part of holding it together. I have such a different view of this place. It seems that the faces of evil. Always seem to change. I'm not a revolutionary. I'm not the world's leader. But I'm a part of holding it together. I have such a different view of this place. It seems that the faces of evil. Always change. In this generation, over and over again. Something has to be said. This is not a threat noise!. PEACE!. ILLUSIONS!. Death is in the air. NOISE!. PEACE!. ILLUSIONS!. NOISE!. PEACE!. ILLUSIONS!. Riots fill our streets. NOISE!. PEACE!. ILLUSIONS!. Peace is an illusion. Death has come!.     </segment1>
