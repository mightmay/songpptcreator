		<segment1>How long must I pray, must I pray to You?. How long must I wait, must I wait for You?. How long 'til I see Your face, see You shining through?. I'm on my knees, begging You to notice me. I'm on my knees, Father will you turn to me? </segment1>
		<segment2>One tear in the dropping rain, One voice in the sea of pain. Could the maker of the stars. Hear the sound of my breakin' heart?. One light, that's all I am. Right now I can barely stand. If You're everything You say You are. Won't You come close and hold my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>I've been so afraid, afraid to close my eyes. So much can slip away before I say goodbye. But if there's no other way, I'm done asking why. Cuz I'm on my knees, begging You to turn to me. I'm on my knees, Father will you run to me? </segment3>
		<segment4>One tear in the dropping rain, One voice in the sea of pain. Could the maker of the stars. Hear the sound of my breakin' heart?. One light, that's all I am. Right now I can barely stand. If You're everything You say You are. Won't You come close and hold my heart.</segment4>
		<segment5>So many questions without answers, Your promises remain. I can't sleep but I'll take my chances to hear You call my name. To hear You call my name</segment5>
		<segment6>One tear in the dropping rain, One voice in the sea of pain. Could the maker of the stars. Hear the sound of my breakin' heart?. One light, that's all I am. Right now I can barely stand. If You're everything You say You are. Won't You come close and hold my heart.</segment6>
		<segment7>Hold my heart, could you hold my heart?. Hold my heart.	.     </segment7>
