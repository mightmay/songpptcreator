		<segment1>The long-awaited rains have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground. and carved their way to where the wild and rushing river can be found. And like the rains I have been carried here to where the river flows, yeah. My heart is racin' and my knees are weak as I walk to the edge. I know there is no turning back once my feet have left the ledge. And in the rush I hear a voice, it's telling me it's time to. Take the leap of faith. So here I go. . I'm diving in. I'm going deep. In over my head I wanna be. Caught in the rush. Lost in the flow. In over my head I wanna go. The river's deep. The river's wide. The river's water is alive. So sink or swim. I'm diving in. I'm diving in. . There is a supernatural power in this mighty river's flow. It can bring the dead to life, and it can fill an empty soul. And give a heart the only thing worth livin' and worth dyin' for, yeah. But we will never know the awesome power of the grace of God. Until we let ourselves get swept away into this holy flood. So if you'll take my hand, we'll close our eyes and count to three. And take the leap of faith. Come on let's go    </segment1>
