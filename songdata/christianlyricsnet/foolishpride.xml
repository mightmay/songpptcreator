		<segment1>She stayed up all night and cried into her pillow. And fought off the urge to just break down and call. Last night to find the fault seemed so darn easy. But now whose to blame don't matter much at all. She thinks if she calls him it just shows weakness. So the hurt goes on with every tear she's cried. Ain't it sad to see a good love fall to pieces. Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride</segment1>
		<segment2>Turn out the lights the competition's over. The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight. And while the bridges burn, another hard-hard lesson's learned. As through the ashes passion slowly dies. And this romance goes down to foolish pride</segment2>
		<segment3>He relives every word they spoke in anger. He walks the floor and punches out the wall. To apologize to her would be so simple. But instead he cries I'll be damned if I'll crawl. If he loses her he's lost his best friend. And that's more then just a lover can provide. So he wrestles with emotions that defeat him. Chalk another love lost up to foolish pride</segment3>
		<segment4>Turn out the lights the competition's over. The stubborn souls are the losers here tonight. And while the bridges burn, another hard-hard lesson's learned. As through the ashes passion slowly dies. And this romance goes down to foolish pride</segment4>
		<segment5>Chalk another heartbreak up to foolish pride.     </segment5>
