		<segment1>Lies pour from your tongue like a fountain of death selfish spite brands your outcome and how you see me and how you show yourself you heart strings broken now your hope was stolen with your innocence as the world plays the strings of your heart contaminate a growing seed to watch it wither and die seize your pray and show them the furnace your hope was stolen with your innocence your lies your spites we will cut through He will cut you down and bring destruction tear down your foundation heart strings broke.    </segment1>
