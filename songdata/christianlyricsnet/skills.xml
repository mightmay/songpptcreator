		<segment1>See the light or get knocked off. I dont talk a lot. I drop it hot modern day psalmist topping charts. Get me in my comfort at a concert. For child hurts merging in the city clubs and outskirts. Power the verse from the words of God dialoging. Keep walking proceed behind the line of caution. Its just in I heard them mens talking. He aint the same dude changed afraid he came to pay dues </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. It used to be about skills. Now its about bills. You dont know me and you cant hold me, yo!!!. Im still true to my game. Where I put my name. No I wont change your all fake </segment2>
		<segment3>I wanna run away from where I was found. And bring me one step closer to where I am now. And every time you try, breaking me down. Im gonna get right back up, and stand my ground </segment3>
		<segment4>I run up in your set with black cons and a skate deck. Throwing hockey pucks blowing speakers and mic check. One, Two, what you gone do when I come through. With a team of crazy Canadians rocking skidoos and snow races. You can call it whatever you like, wont have an affect on your life, Right. Tell me people never listen to the words. Well watch the reaction I get when I drop this verse </segment4>
		<segment5>Step into this game man, a lot of punches being thrown at you. Ive fallen down I dont know how many times, you just got to get. Right back up. Move!!!! </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus </segment6>
		<segment7>I wanna run away from where I was found. And bring me one step closer to where I am now. And every time you try, breaking me down. Im gonna get right back up, and stand my ground.     </segment7>
