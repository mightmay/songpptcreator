		<segment1>Chorus 1</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I see how much You love me. Constant One You will never leave. I will keep in You</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 1</segment3>
		<segment4>You are the One Who gave. All that You had to cover my shame. O no one can deny that You paid this price. You are the One Who gave. You have the only Name with power enough. To take all my blame. O no one can deny that You paid this price. You have the only Name</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 2</segment5>
		<segment6>You remain holding me. When I and lost and stuck out at sea. Though the world may despise this love in Your Eyes. You remain holding me    </segment6>
