		<segment1>I was never going to fall. (I was never going to fall). But the smile, the face has sealed my fate. (The smile, the face). She's weird, an addict of it all. Lets wait for another taste!. (I have nothing left to give)</segment1>
		<segment2>The world, has turned, black and cold. And I, can't catch my breathe. You rehearsed your lines. With rhythmic details. They match, the pounding in my chest</segment2>
		<segment3>The summer came and you left me with your words. The clever sounds from your mouth. They can make me feel so worthless. And you say, that I am not enough. And through my heart is breaking open. Know that I will not be broken</segment3>
		<segment4>The person you claimed to be, is not who haunts me now. The cherished lines behind those brown eyes. That you swore were true more times than I can count</segment4>
		<segment5>The summer came and you left me with your words. The clever sounds from your mouth. They can make me feel so worthless. And you say, that I am not enough. And through my heart is breaking open. Know that I will not be broken</segment5>
		<segment6>I know these words are weak and young. But broken as I come undone. And while I drown in these mistakes. You ego swells but I can tell. You know that you're a fake.</segment6>
		<segment7>(You cried and cried I'm your friend!). Just to save some face!. (You didn't want it to end!). In just a week I'm replaced!. (You wanted me so listen to me but can you hear me now?!). (Your just a sickness and a cancer!). The cancer's your filthy mouth.    </segment7>
