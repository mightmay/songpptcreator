		<segment1>You feel the rhythm pumping through your veins. Backbeat is pulsing, driving you insane. Giving in, was it your mistake?. Endless regret is keeping you awake. It wasn't me who spread the sheets. Called it a day and made this bed. The choice is yours, my friend. I never once sold you short. From you can I expect apathy?. Never me. From a distance I embrace (the) decent. Watching the mountains fall into the sea. Head in your hands. Stumble to bended knees. Wishing this moment could be lost in time. Slipping away, trying to press rewind. Did you think I'd walk away, bow down so gracefully, say what you want, say what you need?. I feel you pulling at the thread until the separation of fabric from seam    </segment1>
