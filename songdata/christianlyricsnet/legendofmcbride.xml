		<segment1>Long ago on the Texas Plains. Was a little town. That never changed. Until a man rode into town, A Ranger known for miles around</segment1>
		<segment2>Well, he could keep the peace. Without a gun. From Abilene down to Galveston</segment2>
		<segment3>When he rode by the general store. People crowded through the door. To see the legend and the man called McBride,</segment3>
		<segment4>And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh, woh. In Iverson</segment4>
		<segment5>Through the doors of the old hotel. A burnin' fire began to build. People screamin' for their lives, And the first one there was john McBride.</segment5>
		<segment6>And just as soon. As he stepped in. People saw the roof cave in, And everybody knew. That he would not survive</segment6>
		<segment7>And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh, woh. In Iverson</segment7>
		<segment8>Than a lady right outside, Said her baby boy was trapped inside. But not a man would fight the flames, And she knew. That it would be too late</segment8>
		<segment9>But through the smoke. And burnin flames. She heard her baby. Call her name. The boy appeared. But no one knew. Who saved his life.</segment9>
		<segment10>And when the boy grew old and gray. He spoke about that fateful day, And the man that saved his life, Texas Ranger, john McBride</segment10>
		<segment11>And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh, woh. In Iverson</segment11>
		<segment12>And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh, woh, And oh, woh woh</segment12>
		<segment13>Still I travel far and wide, Yeah. To hear the legend of McBride. YEAH     </segment13>
