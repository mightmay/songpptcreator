		<segment1>she's been dazed and induced. wants a part-time God. for the private use. but she won't take a stand. 'cause she might get tagged. as a closet Jesus Fan </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Sign on. The time is drawing near. This is surely a banner year. To be a public witness. Sing on. The lines are drawn and clear. There's no straddling fences here. We're going public with this</segment2>
		<segment3>he's displaced and unglued. scared that faith in God. could be misconctrued. but the cross makes him wish. that this spine was more. than a school of jellyfish </segment3>
		<segment4>- Chorus -    </segment4>
