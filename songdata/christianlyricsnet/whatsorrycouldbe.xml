		<segment1>Take me for a fool and I'll do the same for you. To catch what's coming down I'll repeat myself out loud</segment1>
		<segment2>Finally I recall all the photographs on the wall. All my friends agree that the latter half is not me</segment2>
		<segment3>A long time ago I might have been. Tying my hope around you again. But holding me now won't do any good. 'cause I died before I could</segment3>
		<segment4>Remembering what I've seen takes an awful lot out of me. Some day you might hear an apology that's sincere</segment4>
		<segment5>A long time ago I might have been. Tying my hope around you again. But holding me now won't do any good. 'cause I died before I could</segment5>
		<segment6>The pain that's all around could make me it's Home so I call it my own. As sorry as I seem you never could dream what sorry could be</segment6>
		<segment7>A long time ago I might have been. Tying my hope around you again. But holding me now won't do any good. 'cause I died before I could. Feel anything that matters today. Sing songs that won't go away. All I can do all that's left to be. Is feel it openly    </segment7>
