		<segment1>Ladies and gents, well I take no offense. no, I'm not who you're here to see. and it won't be long till the headliner's on. and then you'll be done with me</segment1>
		<segment2>So don't rack your brain, no you've not heard my name. or a single song of mine. and if you need to go potty, well it's out in the lobby. but I'd go now while there's still time.</segment2>
		<segment3>Cuz I'm the opening act, don't get much time. maybe four tracks or five at best. so I play only songs that I hope make you long. to go out and buy the rest. and it is okay if I choose to be shameless. cuz tonight I'm not getting paid. so as soon as I'm able, I'll be out by my table. telling you about my MySpace</segment3>
		<segment4>Well I wish I could say with the truth on my face. that the reason I'm here tonight. is cuz they like my songs and they just can't go wrong. without the opening I provide. but the truth is I'm cheap, and I don't take much space. because it's just me and my guitar. so when I get to the solo, well I'm up here alone. so I'll just have to whistle that part</segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, I'm the opening act, don't get much time. maybe four tracks or five at best. so I play only songs that I hope make you long. to go out and buy the rest. and it is okay if I choose to be shameless. did I mention I'm not getting paid?. so as soon as I'm able, I'll be out by my table. and if you buy a CD, well you're enabling me. to put bread on my plate, take my wife on a date. well I better stop now before you tune me out. but don't forget about my MySpace    </segment5>
