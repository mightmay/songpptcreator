		<segment1>We are all comatose. We are overfed and under..undernourished, yearning for something more. Never starving yet never quite satisfied. Carnal but without useful flesh or mind. Yeah..</segment1>
		<segment2>I am a walking contradiction that's found consistency. consuming everything, all without producing sustenance.</segment2>
		<segment3>In the parallels we struggle.. struggle to upkeep, there is a better way for us to be set free. From all it is we crave, there must be more to life than to simply stay alive.. to simply stay alive.</segment3>
		<segment4>We are not the same as I hope to show. There is a better way if we just let go. We are not.. we are not the same. We are not.. we are not the same. Let go..</segment4>
		<segment5>In the tension between devouring want or simple need. it's clear the only lines between the ones we preserve.</segment5>
		<segment6>We are not the same as I hope to show. There is a better way if we just let go. We are not.. we are not the same. We are not.. we are not the same. Let go.. We are not the same.</segment6>
		<segment7>And in the parallels we struggle to upkeep, there's a better way for us to be.. for us to be set free. And in the parallels (parallels) we struggle to upkeep (struggle to upkeep), there's a better way for us to be.. for us to be set free    </segment7>
