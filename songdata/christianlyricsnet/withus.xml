		<segment1>VERSE 1:</segment1>
		<segment2>Before the world. You knew the plans for me. Before my heart believed. You came to my rescue. And now I'm found in love. There's nowhere else to run. You keep my life within. Your mighty hand. Oh God</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: There's no end to Your love. There's no end to Your love. You're with us. You're with us. There's nothing in this world. That could take You away. You're with us. You're with us</segment3>
		<segment4>VERSE 2:</segment4>
		<segment5>Before I call. I know You'll answer me. You'll make a way. Beyond what I could imagine. What could separate. From the love You give. I put my hope in everything. That You are. Oh God</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS:</segment6>
		<segment7>There's no end to Your love. There's no end to Your love. You're with us. You're with us. There's nothing in this world. That could take You away. You're with us. You're with us</segment7>
