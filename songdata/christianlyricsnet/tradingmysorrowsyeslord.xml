		<segment1>I'm trading my sorrow. I'm trading my shame. I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm trading my sickness. I'm trading my pain. I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: And we say yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord. Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord. Yes Lord yes Lord yes yes Lord Amen</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm pressed but not crushed persecuted not abandoned. Struck down but not destroyed. I'm blessed beyond the curse for his promise will endure. And his joy's gonna be my strength</segment4>
		<segment5>Though the sorrow may last for the night. His joy comes with the morning    </segment5>
