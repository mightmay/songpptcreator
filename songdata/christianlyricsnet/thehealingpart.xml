		<segment1>It's hard to know what to say. We've said so much that we regret. What a price that we pay. When we can't forgive much less forget</segment1>
		<segment2>The more I hear the more I fear. That we might lose each other</segment2>
		<segment3>Can we skip to the part. Where we come to out senses?. Before we go too far. Love shouldn't be so hard</segment3>
		<segment4>Can we open our hearts, drop our defenses?. Find where forgiveness starts. Let's stop where we are. And skip to the healing part</segment4>
		<segment5>I can't recall what it was. That got this whole thing started. When anger grows like it does. And respect can get discarded</segment5>
		<segment6>Everyday that we wait. Something good is dying</segment6>
		<segment7>Can we skip to the part. Where we come to out senses?. Before we go too far. Love shouldn't be so hard</segment7>
		<segment8>Can we open our hearts, drop our defenses. Find where forgiveness starts. Let's stop where we are. And skip to the healing part    </segment8>
