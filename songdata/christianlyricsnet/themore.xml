		<segment1>I try to control my destiny; I wanna believe I know what I need. But I keep coming up empty. And now I see, I see the way it works, I hold on tight and then it burns. So I give it all to you, to you</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. The more I hold on, the more it all comes undone. The more I let go, Im caught beneath your overflow. And theres more of you, more of you, more of you</segment2>
		<segment3>Im not the fool I was before; Im done with pushing down the doors. Cause I keep coming up empty. And now I see, I see the way it works, Im letting go until it hurts. To find it all in you, in you</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>My all in all, be everything. You fill my cup beyond my dreams. My all in all, be everything. You fill my cup beyond my dreams, my dreams</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]    </segment6>
