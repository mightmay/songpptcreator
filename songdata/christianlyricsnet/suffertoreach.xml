		<segment1>Here comes the rain. When the sky is darkened like October. I'm watching these clouds move in. In the middle of summer. In the middle of summer. The rain will come. Is it time to go under. And where's the Son. . No one said it would be this easy. No one said it would be this hard. Born to suffer. I stand on truth. I stand on You</segment1>
		<segment2>In the middle of summer. The rain will come. Is it time to go under. And where's the sun</segment2>
		<segment3>And here I am. With salt in my wounds. But I'm still moving. I will not be consumed. My eyes are closed. My hands are lifted toward the sky. My eyes are closed. My hands are lifted to You. . In the middle of summer. The rain will come. Is it time to go under. And where's the Son</segment3>
		<segment4>And I will no longer fight. Cause you stand before me. And God let your peace. Slowly move over me</segment4>
		<segment5>And I want to. Be used by You. And I want. To be. Used by You. Used by You    </segment5>
