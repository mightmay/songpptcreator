		<segment1>Lately, nothing I do ever seems to please you. And maybe turning my back would be that much easier, Cause hurtful words are all that we exchange. But I can't watch you walk away. Could I forget about the way it feels to touch you?. And all about the good times that we've been through?. Could I wake up without you everyday, would I let you walk away?</segment1>
		<segment2>No I can't learn to live without. And I can't give up on us now.</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: Oh, I know I could say we're through. And tell myself I'm over you. But even if I made a vow. A promise not to miss you. Now and try to hide the truth inside. I fail cause I just can't live a lie </segment3>
		<segment4>Verse 2: Could I forget the look that tells me that you want me?. And all the reasons that make loving you so easy, The kiss that always makes it hard to breathe, The way you know just what I mean,</segment4>
		<segment5>No I can't learn to live without, oh, So don't you give up on us now.</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus: Oh, I know I could say we're through. And tell myself I'm over you. But even if I made a vow. A promise not to miss you. Now and try to hide the truth inside. I fail cause I just can't live a lie </segment6>
		<segment7>(Instrumental)</segment7>
		<segment8>And I don't wanna try. When I try to hide the truth inside. I fail cause I just can't live a lie. I can't live a lie. I can't live a lie.     </segment8>
