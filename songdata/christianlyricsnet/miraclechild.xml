		<segment1>when you got there. I was sure you'd come too late. we all pay you lip service. then address our prayers to fate. sister gone. she tripped and fell. a prodigal hell. and do I dare believe you'll reach. such a long lost cause. wrapped in gauze. as good as dead </segment1>
		<segment2>she's breathing.. </segment2>
		<segment3>my Lord. she's a miracle child. I know. she's a miracle child. and I saw. how she'd chosen the grave. my Lord. it's a miracle save </segment3>
		<segment4>when she woke up. we were dumbstruck at the sight. like coming out of a coma. all she asked for was more light </segment4>
		<segment5>fluttering eyes. life from a tomb. you flooded her room. with a fearsome mercy. torn from the devil's grip. from the clutches of fear. I can hear her dead heart beating </segment5>
		<segment6>my Lord. she's a miracle child. I know. she's a miracle child. and I saw. how she'd chosen the grave. my Lord. it's a miracle save </segment6>
		<segment7>we lose hope. we mumble our prayers. we seal off the stairs. and never dare believe your reach. can pass through stone. can lead a child home. can make the dead start blinking.     </segment7>
