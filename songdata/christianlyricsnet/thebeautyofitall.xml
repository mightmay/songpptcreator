		<segment1>Do I disappoint you?. Was I not enough to please you after all?. But here is to my promise kept, that I may live and not regret at all. Contentment my friend. How long has it been? How long has it been? </segment1>
		<segment2>Right between alive and living. I survived by forgiving all. Words without communication, as my humble expectations fall. Commitment my friend. Where have you been?</segment2>
		<segment3>Even heroes have to fall. Every diamond has its flaw. You and I we have this wall. We can tear it down now. We can tear it down. And that's the beauty of it all</segment3>
		<segment4>Funny how we never saw this coming. Or we just ignored the signs. Now learning from the past is really all that I can ask of you and I. You still have my heart. You still have soul </segment4>
		<segment5>Even heroes have to fall. Every diamond has its flaw. You and I we have this wall. But we can tear it down now. We can tear it down. And that's the beauty of it all</segment5>
		<segment6>So what are you afraid of?. Hiding from the truth. Open up you heart and show me that you care. It's time to stop pretending</segment6>
		<segment7>Even heroes have to fall. Every diamond has its flaw. You and I we have this wall. But we can tear it down now. We can tear it down</segment7>
		<segment8>Sometimes weakness makes us strong. Let's just admit that we were wrong. You and I, we built this wall. But we can tear it down now. We can tear it down. And that's the beauty of it all..     </segment8>
