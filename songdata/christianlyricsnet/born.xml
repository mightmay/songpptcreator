		<segment1>As I stand here watching your worn-out shell. You used it well. I can feel it in the atmosphere somehow. I want to see with your eyes right now. I know you've never been this close before. You've been feeling homesick for a while. This is the moment you've been longing for</segment1>
		<segment2>The gate is slowly opening more and more. And I'm already missing you. I always thouhgt the walls between. The worlds were bigger was thicker. And I'm already missing you    </segment2>
