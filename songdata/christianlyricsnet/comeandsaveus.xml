		<segment1>The edge of a cliff. The dead-end signs. That we've been ignoring all this time. All our mistakes and crossing lines. That sinking feeling that's not far behind. We're less than more, we're falling short. No matter how we try..</segment1>
		<segment2>There's nothing we can do. Nothing we can do. Father we need You. To come and save us</segment2>
		<segment3>If we could see. Behind the veil. Just a glimpse of how You love us when we fail. Maybe we would finally see You mercey never ends</segment3>
		<segment4>There's nothing we can do. Nothing we can do. Father we need You. To come and save us</segment4>
		<segment5>There's nothing we can do. Nothing we can do. Father we need You. To come and save us</segment5>
		<segment6>It's all been done. It's all been done. You have come. All for love</segment6>
		<segment7>There's nothing we can do. Nothing we can do. Father we need You. To come and save us</segment7>
		<segment8>There's nothing we can do. Nothing we can do. Father we need You. To come and save us</segment8>
		<segment9>Father we need You. To come and save us. Father we need You. To come and save us</segment9>
		<segment10>To come and save us.     </segment10>
