		<segment2>I want to make much of you Jesus. I want to make much of your love. I want to live today to give you the praise. That You alone are so worthy of. I want to make much of your mercy. I want to make much of your cross. I give you my life. Take it and let it be used. To make much of you</segment2>
		<segment3>And how can I kneel here. And think of the cross. The thorns and the whip and the nails and the spear. The infinite cost. To purchase my pardon. And bear all my shame. To think I have anything worth boasting in except for your name. Cause I am a sinner. And you are the Savior</segment3>
		<segment4>I want to make much of you Jesus. I want to make much of your love. I want to live today to give you the praise. That You alone are so worthy of. I want to make much of your mercy. I want to make much of your cross. I give you my life. Take it and let it be used. To make much of you</segment4>
		<segment5>This is your love, oh God. Not to make much of me. But to send your own son. So that we could make much of you. For all eternity</segment5>
		<segment6>I want to make much of you Jesus. I want to make much of your love. I want to live today to give you the praise. That You alone are so worthy of. I want to make much of your mercy. I want to make much of your cross. I give you my life. Take it and let it be used. To make much of you</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to make much of you. Much of you Jesus.     </segment7>
