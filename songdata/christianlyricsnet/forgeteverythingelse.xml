		<segment1>There's a smell upon the rose, and a thousand spirals before you reach the core, and I don't know why, But it makes me think of you, and how you might just love me, created me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Draw the curtains, just let them fall, forget everything else, but just that I need you, only that I need you.</segment2>
		<segment3>There's so many other loves, there's so many other things that suit me, but I think I'll choose you. You alone can quench my thirst, there's a fearful longing, and I can't make sense of it, I can't make sense of it, I can't make sense of it.</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm am tired of living without you.     </segment4>
