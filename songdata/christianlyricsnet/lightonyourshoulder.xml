		<segment1>Keep it tight, it's all right. Everybody's on down the boulevard tonight. Say, it's OK, looking for a beam and a place to be yeah. I want you to sow right through ya, Keep the light on your shoulder. Sometimes life's just a crawl I know it. It's almost got enough of me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Keeping it tight, it's all right. Everyone's had a good time tonight. So play, it's the game, everybody's got a price to pay. Don't cheat, give up your seat. Everything is moving come along with me now. So play, so stay, so everything has room tonight. I've got something to sow right through you. Keep the light on your shoulder. Since all our shadows were thrown down, we've been. Keeping the light on ourselves    </segment2>
