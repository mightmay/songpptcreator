		<segment1>I'm sick of walking in your bad dreams. I'm tired of talking up your dancings. Its time for me to take a ride and turn it around. It's time for you to realize that</segment1>
		<segment2>Iﾂ知 gonna scream it in your mainstream. Iﾂ知 gonna take it with the main street. Iﾂ知 gonna put it in your mind and turn it around. Iﾂ知 gonna draw it on the line</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: It's coming around, it's coming around. It's coming no doubt I'm gonna see you on the other side. It's coming around it's coming around. It's coming no doubt</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm sick of walking on your landmines. I'm sick of falling on your trip lines. I'm gonna take another ride. And turn it around. It's time for you to realize that</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm gonna get out on the last train. I'm gonna catch it in the fast lane. I'm gonna put it in your mind and turn it around. I'm gonna leave it all behind</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS 2x</segment6>
		<segment7>I see it coming around. I see it coming around</segment7>
		<segment8>I see it coming around at the end of the day. I see it coming and it's going away. It's coming around. I see it coming around. It's coming around</segment8>
		<segment9>CHORUS 2x    </segment9>
