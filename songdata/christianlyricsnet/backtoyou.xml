		<segment1>Sitting here on the dock as the sun is setting. Red and gold in a purple sky. And the breeze through the trees. keeps them gently rocking. Just like the waves that are keeping time</segment1>
		<segment2>And I know You are all around me. I'm so glad You came and found me</segment2>
		<segment3>Out here tonight I'm caught so up in wonder. So many things that I've wanted to say. Thank You for life and for love and for laughter. Thanks for this heart that is finding its way. Back to You</segment3>
		<segment4>All around, hear the sound of creation singing. Lift their praise up to God on high. I know You're there, know You care, I know You made the moment. I take a breath and I close my eyes</segment4>
		<segment5>And I know You are all around me</segment5>
		<segment6>I know that I gotta get on..    </segment6>
