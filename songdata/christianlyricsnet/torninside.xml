		<segment1>I can't speak, I'm lost for words, I can't hear, the silence burns a whole inside of me, that I can't fill for the life of me. I can't see, I'm blinded by the things you say to me are lies. I can't feel, feel you near, and that's because you were never here. What am I supposed to do?. How am I supposed to feel?. I put my trust in you, but life can change. You lied to me, you let me down, you turned this smile into a frown. and now you're the only reason why, I find it hard to sleep at night. I'm feeling sad, feeling blue, I think of the past times spent with you. and now there's nothing left to say, so I just turn my head away.    </segment1>
