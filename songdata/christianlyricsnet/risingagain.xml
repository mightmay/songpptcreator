		<segment1>I'm rising. Rising again. This time on my own. Breaking away from myself. Letting it go. All that I hung on to. Gaining comfort through uncertainty. Cutting ties with reason and security. New horizons are all that I see. Crushing doubt and all that stands in front of me. I've got to make this change and I've got to do it now. I'm rising again. I won't fall down. I won't fall. Self doubt has brought me down. It's kicking me in the back. Tied my hands and bound my legs. Now ther's no turning back. Sun is burning my face. Wind is blowing at my back. Pushing forward in spite of myself. I've got to make this change and I've got to do it now. I'm rising again. I won't fall down. I won't fall. Like a train that holds the rail. Never losing the track. Pushing forward in spite of you. I know what I have to do. I'm gonna rise again. I'm gonna rise.    </segment1>
