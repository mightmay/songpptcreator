		<segment1>Moral laws do not apply / The mind is capable to justify. The madman has come / The madness attacks my mind. Cannot comprehend a purpose in randomness. Where is God? Have you killed him? </segment1>
		<segment2>Self aware observation / Thousands of years. Finite greatness, finite cruelty. Which is the standard of man without God? Meaningless. Which is the standard of man? No rationale for what exists</segment2>
		<segment3>The madman has come / The madness attacks my mind. Cannot comprehend a purpose in randomness. Where is God? Have you killed him?</segment3>
		<segment4>Liberation of no law / Exhilaration of no God. Justified in the mind / Leads to horrors of every kind</segment4>
		<segment5>What if there was a gun to your head? Would it not matter?. What if there was a gun to your head? No meaning in your death </segment5>
		<segment6>The madman has come / The madness attacks my mind. Cannot comprehend a purpose in randomness. Where is God? Have you killed him?    </segment6>
