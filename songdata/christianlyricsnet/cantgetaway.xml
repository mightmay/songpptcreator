		<segment1>I am an arrow, I am a rocket. I am a river and nothing can stop it. Cause You are the target and You are the atmosphere. You are the ocean that keeps pulling me, You're pulling me here</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus:). And I, can't get away, can't get away. Can't get away, can't get away. I can't get away, can't get away..I keep running into You. (repeat)</segment2>
		<segment3>I am a beggar, You are the table. I am so helpless, God You are so able. And when I get turned around You change my direction. You're so perfect, I'm so broken, here You come with arms wide open. Chasing after me down every road. You're always waiting there</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Even when I close my eyes, I can't help but see. There's no place that I can hide, You're such a part of me. I can't get away cause I keep running into You. I can't get away..</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus).     </segment6>
