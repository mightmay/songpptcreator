		<segment1>Stepping over two steps closer. I sit around wasting time, feel like the poster for a. Self-help line. Well me know the truth when we're older</segment1>
		<segment2>For the first time in my whole life. I'm not afraid of feeling alive. For the last time I'm falling behind. And nothing out there will change me mind</segment2>
		<segment3>Let's start over crimson clover. While those golden nights get colder</segment3>
		<segment4>If I could I'd press rewind. Turn on record and leave the past behind. Will we know the truth when we're older</segment4>
		<segment5>For the first time in my whole life. I'm not afraid of feeling alive. For the last time I'm falling behind. And nothing out there will change me</segment5>
		<segment6>When you find me will you remind me. We're one step closer, two steps closer</segment6>
		<segment7>For the first time in my whole life. I'm not afraid of feeling alive. For the last time I'm falling behind. And nothing out there will change me</segment7>
		<segment8>For the first time in my whole life. I'm not afraid of feeling alive. For the last time I'm falling behind. And nothing out there will change me</segment8>
		<segment9>For the first time in my whole life. I'm not afraid of feeling alive. This is the last time I'm falling behind. And nothing out there will change my mind.     </segment9>
