		<segment1>Cornelius was favored by God. He prayed to Him constantly, daily. Oh, Cornelius was in the army. A pagan believer from Rome. Cornelius! An angel from God. Came straight to the spot he was praying. Oh, Cornelius! Acts 10 in verse 3. The angel said Peter must come to your home. Makin' lunch in the afternoon. Where was Peter? Up on Simon's roof. He went up on top to pray. And the Lord sent some men there to take him away. Cornelius said, &quot;Hey, can we start?. &quot;We're waiting upon what youÂ’re sayin.'&quot;. So Cornelius, fell down on his knees. But Peter said, &quot;Please do not&quot; so. He got up. True salvation! They trusted in Him. They called on the Lord there on that day. To the nations that once were in sin. God opened the doors there on that day.     </segment1>
