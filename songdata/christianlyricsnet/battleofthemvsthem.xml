		<segment1>Though many a year as now passed. The lesson's the same, but the sentiments changed. The impression it made still does last for all.</segment1>
		<segment2>Serving his country, Enlist! Do it now. His took up his arms, he would show. Such bravery as he took many a life, Of the people he would never know</segment2>
		<segment3>Sing of me. Of all the men I've killed, I know that this will build me up.</segment3>
		<segment4>Think of me. I know that I'll be brave. They all fell down that day.</segment4>
		<segment5>Well after the war, people picked up their life. The damage was already done. While fatherless children slept under the door, And woke innocent to the sun.</segment5>
		<segment6>Please why me?. I know they'd take it back, Why don't they take it back?</segment6>
		<segment7>Comfort me. A child grows to fast, And now let him ask.</segment7>
		<segment8>A small little child sits and waits for his dad, Hands clutching a brown telegram, Informs him his father won't be coming home. He gave up his life for his land.</segment8>
		<segment9>Sing of me. And all the men I've killed. I know that this will build me up.</segment9>
		<segment10>And think of me. I know that was brave. We all fell down that day.     </segment10>
