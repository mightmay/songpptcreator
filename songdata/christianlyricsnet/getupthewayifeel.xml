		<segment1>So you think that were not the same. When you feel this way. And the lies will fall this time</segment1>
		<segment2>So you think that it's just a game. Between us. I will swallow my own pride </segment2>
		<segment3>But you know that you know to get up. That's the way I feel sometimes</segment3>
		<segment4>And ill stand up, this time, tonight what do you say. Do you feel this way. And the lies will fall this time</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes    </segment5>
