		<segment1>Time stands still,  The air begins to swell. The broken hearted shadow of someone who feels left out of life. Seems like all the stars have fallen from the sky. All that's left is the grinning moon that's laughing at your cries.</segment1>
		<segment2>Are you burning up down inside?. Will you ever make it through the night?. Will you ever give up this fight?</segment2>
		<segment3>It seems so hard to pick yourself up when, The tears come easily but you just can't seem to make them stop. You can't stop thinking of the heartache as you break down and cry.</segment3>
		<segment4>Are you burning up down inside?. Will you ever make it through the night?. Please do not give up this fight?. Will you be alright, when you close your eyes?. Will you be alight; when you close your eyes; when you say goodnight?. All alone.     </segment4>
