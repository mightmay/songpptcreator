		<segment1>Everywhere*. Everyday. All we hear is. All we hear is wait. It's not your time. Just get back in line</segment1>

		<segment3>We won't back down. We gotta take our best shot. Give it all we got now. We won't back down. They say we'll never make it. But we're gonna take it all the way</segment3>
		<segment4>And with the clock. Running. We're gonna leave our fears and failures all behind. This is our time. We'll reach till we touch the sky</segment4>
		<segment5>We won't back down. We gotta take our best shot. Give it all we got now. We won't back down. They say we'll never make it. But we're gonna take it all the way</segment5>
		<segment6>We wont hold back. And we wont slow down the pace. We wont let go and we wont call off the chase</segment6>
		<segment7>We won't back down. We gotta take our best shot. Give it all we got now. We won't back down. They say we'll never make it. But we're gonna take it all the way    </segment7>
