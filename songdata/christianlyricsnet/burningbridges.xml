		<segment1>Set this place on fire, burn it to the ground. Cause I dont want to live here anymore. take away these thoughts that empty me. Could You take them all away? </segment1>
		<segment2>Am I too blind? I cant see, its killing me. I feed off abuse, nothings changed. It always bleeds like this </segment2>
		<segment3>The holiest of liars, what have I become?. Im holding on to nothing once again. Addiction holds the keys to my freedom. Could You take it all away? </segment3>
		<segment4>Am I too blind? I cant see. It always bleeds like this.     </segment4>
