		<segment1>If the tears. Should ever cloud your eyes. If the rain. Should ever darken. The skies above you. You'll be alright. 'Cause I'm here, I'm here. And I'll turn your. Grey skies back to blue. 'Cause there's nothing. I won't do for you</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Just a whisper away. I'm closer to you. Than the air that you breathe. Believe me it's true. I will never leave. I promise to you. Forever, forever we will be</segment2>
		<segment3>If tomorrow. Feels like a lonely room. Without someone. There holding you. Know you'll be alright. I'll be at your side. At your side. Hold on tight. You know I'll never be too far. 'Cause I wrote this promise. On your heart</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Whenever you're. Stranded in the cold. Remember my love's an overcoat. I'm here to keep you. Safe in my arms. Where you belong</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus)</segment6>
		<segment7>. Whenever you're afraid. I'll be your hiding place. I won't be late for you</segment7>
		<segment8>(Chorus).     </segment8>
