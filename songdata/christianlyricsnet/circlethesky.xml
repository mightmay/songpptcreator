		<segment1>You made this bed with idle hands, tired hearts, and unwoken souls, our. death is out new breath. my coma is my life</segment1>
		<segment2>Sleep on, dream on. Circle the sky</segment2>
		<segment3>I know you're better than this. You're not the same as you were before, You've changed you're not the same</segment3>
		<segment4>You're not the same as you were last night. You've changed, you're not the same. The I Love You's and goodbye huges, right out. the door</segment4>
		<segment5>I can't believe you did this to me. I can't believe it happened again. And I'll pass 10,000 just to be with you. And I'll pass 10,000 more for you by my side. With you by my side, how can you fail. With me by your side, how can you die. A murder, a modern day suicide</segment5>
		<segment6>Circle the sky    </segment6>
