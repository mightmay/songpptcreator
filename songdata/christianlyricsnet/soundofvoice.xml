		<segment1>I ran away from your love, but you waited for me, yes, you waited for me. An then I heard your song singing over me, singing over me. Now that I hear you, Lord I want to know you more, I want to know you more. Sing your song to me, oh, theres no greater thing. Than to listen to the sound of your voice, the sound of your voice. Lord, I am calling your name and Im waiting for you. So wont you show me your way, and I will follow you, yes, I will follow you. Singing over me, bringing peace and mercy with a song that never ends. Singing over me, marvelous and holy, Lord, I want to hear your song again    </segment1>
