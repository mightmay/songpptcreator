		<segment1>Been feelin' so crazy lately. When it seems that You're not around. The sun and the moon shine bright. But my eyes are all Yours now. Don't know how I lived without You. I don't remember how it used to feel. Lord, I can't imagine if I had no You to hold me </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Where would I go with no You to run to, No You to hold me when I am afraid?. Who would I be with no You beside me?. I outta know it by now without You there's no me. Ohhh, there's no me </segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, when I need You, You're always here. To play through the laughter, love throught the tears. And when my heart seems so far away. Into Your arms is where I wanna stay. I tried to find the words to tell You. All the things in my heart's been telling me. I don't wanna know how it feels to have no You to love me </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus </segment4>
		<segment5>Where would I go with no You to run to, No You to hold me when I am afraid?. Who would I be with no You beside me?. I outta know it by now without You.. </segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus </segment6>
		<segment7>where would I go.. where would I be?.     </segment7>
