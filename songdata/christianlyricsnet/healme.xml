		<segment1>It's another good-to-see-you Sunday morning. Oh, I hardly hear the words roll off my tongue. Looking in myself for signs of something. That's long gone</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, I stumble through a verse that says You love me. As the voices echo my thoughts drift away. And I close my eyes ashamed I'm feelin' nothing. I pray</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Heal me. Heal these eyes. Heal this heart. Heal my mind. Breathe Your breath of life. Heal me. Wake my soul. From this sleep. Give me back the joy. Of when I first believed. Heal me</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, I lose myself to one more day's indifference. When my eyes are everywhere but fixed on You. I don't have the strength to overcome this distance. But You do. You do</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>I don't wanna waste another minute. Takin' all Your love for granted. I just wanna feel Your Holy Spirit. Rushing over me</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS    </segment7>
