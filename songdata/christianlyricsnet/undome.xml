		<segment1>Papa, I think I messed up again. Was it something I did?. Was it something I said?. I don't mean to do you wrong. It's just the way of human nature! </segment1>
		<segment2>Sister, I know I let you down. I can tell by the fact. You never come around. You don't have to say a thing. I can tell by your eyes. Exactly what you mean</segment2>
		<segment3>That it's time. To get down on my knees and pray. &quot;Lord, undo me!&quot;. Put away my flesh and bone. 'Til You own this spirit through me Lord, Undo me.</segment3>
		<segment4>Mama, I know I made you cry. But I never meant to hurt you. I never meant to lie. While the world shook its head in shame. I let you take the blame</segment4>
		<segment5>Brother, I know you labored. So hard to please. But I cut you down. And I left you on your knees. Well I know it must be</segment5>
		<segment6>Time to get down on my knees and pray. &quot;Lord, undo me!&quot;. Put away my flesh and bone. 'Til You own this spirit through me Lord</segment6>
		<segment7>I am wanting, needing, guilty and greedy. Unrighteous, unholy; undo me. Undo me!</segment7>
		<segment8>Abba Father You must wonder why. More times than Peter I have denied. Three nails and a cross to prove. I owe my life eternally to you!</segment8>
		<segment9>And it's time. To get down on my knees and pray. &quot;Lord, undo me!&quot;. Put away my flesh and bone. 'Til You own this spirit through me Lord, Undo me</segment9>
		<segment10>.     </segment10>
