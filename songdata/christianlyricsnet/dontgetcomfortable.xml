		<segment1>Comfortable, don't comfortable. I am going to move this mountain. Then I'm going to move you in. Yesterday, this is not yesterday. You were standing on my shoulders. Now you're standing on the edge. You were looking for a sign all this time</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). I am gonna show you what I mean. I am gonna love like you've never seen. You are gonna live like you used to dream. This is your new song</segment2>
		<segment3>So afraid, that you don't have to be afraid. Even if you make mistakes. You know that I'll remain. You been looking for a sign all this time. If you seek you find me anytime</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>Can you feel the call. Of love is in moving you. Don't be a child of God. A Love is reaching you. It's everywhere a call of love</segment5>
		<segment6>I just wanna show you what I mean. I just wanna love like you've never seen. Do you wanna live like you used to dream. Than I've got a song for you</segment6>
