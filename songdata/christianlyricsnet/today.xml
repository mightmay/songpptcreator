		<segment1>Worry keeps waking me up. Calling me at 3 am. Fear wants to shut me down. Telling me what might happen. Doubt plays with my mind. Trying to twist the truth. All these distractions, beg a reaction. So here's what I'm gonna do</segment1>
		<segment2>Right here, right now. I'm living for You and nothing else. Yesterday in history. And tomorrow's gonna write itself. All I got is the moment I'm in. And I don't ever want to waste. This gift, this chance, right here, right now. Today</segment2>
		<segment3>Joy is what I choose. When my blue turns to gray. Faith is where I turn. When the world says there's no way. And peace is what I find. Resting in your hands. And Your love is more than enough. To keep my heart content</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>I know that You hold. The things I can't control. So I am letting go</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS    </segment6>
