		<segment1>Gone in a second, vanished in thin air. The Lord at His appearing, His people disappear. We are sons of God, we'll meet Him in the air. Those without Him will live in despair. Chorus: BLINK (x4). Coming in the clouds, like a thief in the night, to take us away in the blink of an eye. Without Him you will see the horror of His wrath. Bow before Him, this chance could be your last. Chorus: BLINK (x4). Here He comes!. Gone in a second, vanished in thin air. The Lord at His appearing, his people disappear. Without Him you will see the horror of His wrath. Bow before Him, this chance could be your last. Chorus: BLINK (x4) BLINK!. (Matthew 25:1-13, 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18, Revelation 1:7, 3:3)    </segment1>
