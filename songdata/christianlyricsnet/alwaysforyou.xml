		<segment1>Sometimes I just can't find the words. To tell you the way that I feel. Cause I found a love that's so real. And I've been searching all my life. For someone to show me the way. Then you turned my night into day. I see clearly now, my arms are open wide. And I'm gonna make it through with you here by my side</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: As long as the stars light up the sky. Until the rivers have all run dry. There'll always be love in this heart of mine. Forever true (always for you). As long as the world keeps turning round. I'll always be thankful for what I've found. I'll never let the sun go down. I'll keep shining through. Always for you</segment2>
		<segment3>Drifting on a lonely sea. Without a friend in the world. Then you were the voice that I heard. And when your arms reached out for me. You made me feel like I belong. You gave me the strength to go on. You are my hope, my prayer, when things are going rough. You always give me the miracle of love</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Always, always for youwith you by my side. Sha la la lahere by my side, here by my side. I see clearly now, my arms are open wide. And I'm gonna make it through with you here by my side</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
