		<segment1>I am outside. And I've been waiting for the sun. And with my wide eyes. I've seen worlds that don't belong</segment1>
		<segment2>My mouth is dry. With words I cannot verbalize. Tell me why we live like this</segment2>
		<segment3>Keep me safe inside. Your arms like towers. Tower over me, yeah</segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause we are broken. What must we do to restore. Our innocence?. And oh, the promise we adored. Give us life again. 'Cause we just wanna be whole</segment4>
		<segment5>Lock the doors. 'Cause I'd like to capture this voice. It came to me tonight. So everyone will have a choice</segment5>
		<segment6>And under red lights. I'll show myself it wasn't forged. We're at war, we live like this</segment6>
		<segment7>Keep me safe inside. Your arms like towers. Tower over me</segment7>
		<segment8>'Cause we are broken. What must we do to restore. Our innocence?. And oh, the promise we adored. Give us life again. 'Cause we just wanna be whole</segment8>
		<segment9>Tower over me. Tower over me. And I'll take the truth at any cost</segment9>
		<segment10>'Cause we are broken. What must we do to restore. Our innocence. And oh, the promise we adored. Give us life again. 'Cause we just wanna be whole    </segment10>
