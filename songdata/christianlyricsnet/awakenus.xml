		<segment1>We are questions that beg for the answers. We are poems awaiting the rhyme. We are riddles that long for solution. With your breath we come alive</segment1>
		<segment2>We are silenced when searching for reasons. We are weary and broken inside. We are desperate for your affection. We are darkness you are light</segment2>
		<segment3>Awaken us, Awaken us. Stir in our hearts your truth. Awaken us, Awaken us. That we might live for you. We are ashes, we are dust. Awaken us</segment3>
		<segment4>You whispered the dawn of creation. And your love has been on display. You have promised that you would be with us. We need you, every day</segment4>
		<segment5>You will lead us out of the desert. You will hold us when weÂ’re weak. We will rise up, we will rise up. To follow our Great King. We will walk with you up the mountain. We walk with you on the sea. We will rise up, we will rise up. To follow our Great King    </segment5>
