		<segment1>Why has your faith gone to nothing. Always pretending that you have made a stand. Leaving all this behind to disappear. Waiting, watching for the trends to let you in</segment1>
		<segment2>I know your reasons, your claims, I see an answer, get back and fight. Where have you gone? What have you done?. When will you know? This is for Him</segment2>
		<segment3>Pick up your cross, get back in the fight. Pick up your cross, get back in the fight    </segment3>
