		<segment1>Worn out, wasted. Like a bird with broken wings. Sometimes grace reminds me. I don't get to be the king</segment1>
		<segment2>But love it washes over. Love it pulls me closer. Love it changes everthing</segment2>
		<segment3>Everything is beautiful. Even when the tears are falling. I don't need a miracle to believe. Even in the crashing down. I can hear redemtion calling. And everything is beautiful to me</segment3>
		<segment4>Sweetly, You release me. From the weight of what I've done. The trigger trips the hammer. But the bullets never come</segment4>
		<segment5>And love it washes over. Love it pulls me closer. Love it changes everything</segment5>
		<segment6>Everything is beautiful. Even when the tears are falling. I don't need a miracle to believe. Even in the crashing down. I can hear redemption calling. And everything is beautiful to me</segment6>
		<segment7>And love like a landslide. Like the wind. Spins around me pulls me in. At it's unveiling, I begin</segment7>
		<segment8>Everything is beautiful. Even when the tears are falling. I don't need a miracle to believe. Even in the crashing down. I can hear redemption calling. And everything is beautiful to me (2x)</segment8>
