		<segment1>It's written with your name on it. It's written. It's written with your name on it. It's written. The late love is one we all stand by. Mirror images of lead bullet in your eyes </segment1>
		<segment2>Reflection in your eyes speaks gentle to me. Our loves eulogy. It was only a game that you wanted to play. I wont be the same </segment2>
		<segment3>Say goodbye. Say goodbye to all that you hold. I kneel down to kiss you. But you wanted to die in your own arms </segment3>
		<segment4>Reflection in your eyes speaks gently. Our loves eulogy. It was only a game that you wanted to play. I wont be the same </segment4>
		<segment5>You were the one to call me hopeless. You were the one to call me dear </segment5>
		<segment6>Standing side by side lives full of fear. Standing side by side.     </segment6>
