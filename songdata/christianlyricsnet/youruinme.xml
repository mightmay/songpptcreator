		<segment1>There is no recovery. The damage has been done. Your love is a hurricane that I cannot outrun </segment1>
		<segment2>You.. ruin me. You make it so hard to be without you </segment2>
		<segment3>I thought I was fine. With both my feet upon the ground. Your love is the ocean. And I think I'm gonna drown </segment3>
		<segment4>You.. ruin me. You make it so hard to be without your love </segment4>
		<segment5>A firestorm. My heart goes up in flames. Oh love, you won the war. And I surrender. I surrender, I surrender </segment5>
		<segment6>You.. ruin me. You make it so hard to be anywhere without. You.. ruin me. You make it so hard to be without you </segment6>
		<segment7>There is no recovery. The damage has been done    </segment7>
