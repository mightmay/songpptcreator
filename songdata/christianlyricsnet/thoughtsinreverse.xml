		<segment1>I feel it taking over everything inside of me. And I'm losing control. Weakness in my chest. My heart stops beating. Flat lined and I'm in between. This is my struggle. This is emptiness. Closer and closer again. I feel it happening. Holding fast to the hands of grace. I know youre stronger inside, stronger than me. Hope walks backwards. My thoughts in reverse. Scream for me, I'll hear your voice. My heart knows no other.     </segment1>
