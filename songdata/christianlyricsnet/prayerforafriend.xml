		<segment1>Lord I lift my friend to you. Ive done all that i know to do, I lift my friend to you. Complicated circumstances have clouded his view. And Lord I lift my friend up to you</segment1>
		<segment2>I fear that I wont have the words, that he needs to hear. I pray for your wisdom oh God, and a heart that's sincere. And Lord I lift my friend up to you</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord I lift my friend to you, my best friend in the world. I know he means much more to you. I want so much to help him, but this is something he has to do. And Lord I lift my friend up to you</segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause there's a way that seems so right to him. But you know where that leads. He's becoming a puppet of the world. Too blind to see the strings. And Lord I lift my friend up to you</segment4>
		<segment5>My friend up to you</segment5>
		<segment6>Lord I lift my friend to you. Ive done all that i know to do, I lift my friend to you    </segment6>
