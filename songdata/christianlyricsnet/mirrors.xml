		<segment2>Remedies were bankrupt like the rest of these </segment2>
		<segment3>Forget what they told you - there's no self-help. Taken by Your glory - don't look back now </segment3>
		<segment4>I don't care who I am, I lost that interest. There are no mirrors deep enough to meet my needs</segment4>
