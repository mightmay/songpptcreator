Portland, Oregon, Seattle, Washington. chi-town, Inglewood, new York, Boston. west coast, east coast, pacific ocean. stopped at the Atlantic just to stick my toe in. rode in airplanes, subways, taxis, ferries, trains all the way across the use. from Nashville to Memphis, Atlanta, st. Louis. ran a marathon and got first in the us. from Texas to phoenix to Cairo in Egypt. the belly dancers danced as I ran with achievement. in sync with the flips of the flops that I rock. I stopped in Miami and I said what''. everything's gonna be alright. from the west coast to the east coast. from la all the way to new York city</segment1>
