		<segment1>It's not like they meant to hurt me. Watchin TV, checkin Britney, televised, my guys. Checkin out her thighs and I roll my eyes and sigh. It's not like I even need to be competing with unreality TV, fantasy. Not for a smart girl like me. Some days it's hard to be a one girl revolution. CHORUS: Sometimes I have good days and it's good to be me. Sometimes I get the best of insecurity. And it's quite alright to be the one and only. But today I feel like the one and lonely. It's not that I don't know beauty is only skin deep. Just the skin I'm in, not the girl within. But one imperfection takes away my grin. Not that I think I'm ugly but. Acne throws me for a backslide. I won't go outside. Makeup can't hide how I feel inside. Some days it's hard to be a one girl revolution. CHORUS. (Oh, the one and lonely). We all have bad hair days. Those nothing good about me days. Just keep moving on cuz they'll be gone. And we'll still be here going on. We have our yesterdays. No lunch cuz the jeans don't fit days. Just keep moving on cuz they'll be gone. And we'll still be here going on. CHORUS: Sometimes I have bad days and it's hard to be me. Sometimes I get brought down by insecurity. And I have my days where I'm the one and lonely. But today I choose to be the one and only. Yea, I'm the one and only.     </segment1>
