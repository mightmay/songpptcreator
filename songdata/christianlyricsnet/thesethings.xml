		<segment1>To know and see you for a time. See through another point of you. And it's you this time. And I feel that you could change my mind. But what would that change. What would that change</segment1>
		<segment2>And these things will never change. For anything or anyone. And you know that I won't leave. For anything or anyone. It's you this time</segment2>
		<segment3>You see all the things I cannot see. But I know that you're the one who can save me</segment3>
		<segment4>To know that you're here. And over and over a again call my name. I know that I know you (again).     </segment4>
