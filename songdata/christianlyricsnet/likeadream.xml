		<segment1>Sometimes the silence speaks. When I dont have the words. Whispering the wonder of Your love. And in my ear a melody. More beautiful than words. And I can hear the promise of Your love. Like a dream coming true. I believe in You. Dont let me go. Im hanging on to You. Heaven with humanity. A miracle of love. Grace that found me broken in my needs. And the mystery of our chemistry. Im never good enough. But still I find Youre everything I need. Forever and ever. Im nothing if Im not holding on    </segment1>
