		<segment1>Freestyles and Hooks, exiled like crooks, baggy jeans my style judge by the looks. Shook by parliament I mean society I in me starting this riot up inside of me. I could by my own suit, and switch up my Tim Boots. The funny thing is I make more money than you do, So classify me as a backpacker manufactured Ill spit on the mic to spite your laughter. Im only young once whats your rush. In God I trust dont mold me Ill never adjust </segment1>
		<segment2>I think youve got the wrong person. So what makes a bad person rappin cursing skating rappin hurting. Whos a Saint? Im still learning. So take me to the hospital or just check yourself. You got enough wood in your eye to make a shelf. Cant say I aint done it, judged or got blunted. Next time confronted Ill shine my boxers out in public </segment2>
		<segment3>Its not that I want your respect or need feel except. Through God I got rest I see you do reject. Huh, looking at me like you know me, judge me by my clothing skeptical, and all knowing. Step in a room now a days and all eye brows raise, is it my sexy face or my messy hair state, (I hope its) it must be the spirit on me saved by grace. Know apology constantly around like monopoly. Courtesy of your ignorance, and people looking different. I stay diligent, and tell my story over instruments. Im not your average adolescence arrogant or disrespecting parents. Hold your tongue in, say nothing ye mumbling the alphabet. Not accurate a false package I outta charge ye for harassment. So the next time I purchase clothes or someone serves me. Im showing love why dont you, show me some courtesy </segment3>
		<segment4>I still remember this occasion back when I was teenaging raging like I lack the patience. Walk into a mall for a purchase, store clerk looking kind a nervous all hawk eyed, and merciless. Chill for a second what you dealing with I wasnt gonna steel it you freaking all serious, Easy on the judgment you gone blown your trumpet, kid looking rugged think Im tripping on some substance, Its not your fault you were born that way, gone astray thinking ever child teens a renegade, Let me shed some light on your blindness open up your iris, ya highness dont check the black or the whiteness, It all about equality word if you follow me, Love your neighbor as yourself what! Thats my policy </segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus. You dont even know me you dont know me (echo). So insecure I guess you judging me (echo). Im not the type of guy that wants acceptance. Not influenced by what people say.     </segment5>
