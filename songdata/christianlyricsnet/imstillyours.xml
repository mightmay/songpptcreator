		<segment1>If You washed away my vanity. If You took away my words. If all my world was swept away. Would You be enough for me?. Would my beating heart still sing? </segment1>
		<segment2>If I lost it all. Would my hands stay lifted. To the God who gives and takes away </segment2>
		<segment3>If You take it all. This life You've given. Still my heart will sing to You </segment3>
		<segment4>When my life is not what I expected. The plans I made have failed. When there's nothing left to steal me away. Will You be enough for me?. Will my broken heart still sing? </segment4>
		<segment5>If I lost it all. Would my hands stay lifted. To the God who gives. And takes away </segment5>
		<segment6>If You take it all. This life You've given. Still my heart. Will sing to You </segment6>
		<segment7>Even if You take it all away. Youll never let me go. Take it all away. But I still know </segment7>
		<segment8>That I'm Yours. I'm still Yours </segment8>
		<segment9>Oh, I'm Yours. I'm still Yours. I'm still Yours     </segment9>
