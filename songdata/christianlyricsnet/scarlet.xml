		<segment1>If I was your love I would want only you. I'd lay at this alter, give all I am, all that is true. </segment1>
		<segment2>And this old scarlet letter won't keep me from holding you. There is nothing you can do. Nothing you do. </segment2>
		<segment3>For love I have scaled the face of these kingdom walls. So let down your hair, let our kiss make fools of them all. </segment3>
		<segment4>And this old scarlet letter won't keep me from holding you. And there is nothing you can do. Nothing you do. </segment4>
		<segment5>And this old scarlet letter won't keep me from holding you. And there is nothing you can do. No there is nothing you can do. No there is nothing you can do.    </segment5>
