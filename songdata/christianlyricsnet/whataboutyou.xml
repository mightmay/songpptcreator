		<segment1>Everybody's looking for a peace that flows. And everybody wants a place to go. Nobody wants to kneel and pray. So nobody receives results without faith. When someone falls along the wayside. And everybody knows why. Another heart sadly broken</segment1>
		<segment2>Everybody needs someone to love. Everybody wants some hand to hold. Everybody needs salvation for their soul. So what about you?</segment2>
		<segment3>Everybody wants to live life good. Does anyone live the way they should. It's never too late to turn around. Cuz everyone lost can be found</segment3>
		<segment4>So when you're feeling so alone. don't think that you can't come home. And when you want to be held. My arms are open so let me know</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus)     </segment5>
