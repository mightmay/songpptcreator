		<segment1>Father he raised us in the grace of god. Jeep wagoneer and blue grass songs. He showed us all the things a proper father would. And even more than the best of fathers do</segment1>
		<segment2>So father here is a song. That i'm singing. And i'd be blessed if you'd just sing along. Pop i've seen for, what i've seen of all the fathers in this world. They're not as great as my old man</segment2>
