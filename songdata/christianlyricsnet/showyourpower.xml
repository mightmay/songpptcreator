		<segment1>He is the Lord and He reigns on high. He is the Lord. Spoke into the darkness, creating the Light. He is the Lord. Who is like unto Him, never ending in days. He is the Lord. And He comes in power when we call on His name. He is the Lord. Chorus: Show Your power. Oh, Lord, our God. Show Your power. Oh, Lord, our God. Oh, Lord, our God. Your Gospel, oh, Lord is the hope for our nation. You are the Lord. It's the power of God for our salvation. You are the Lord. CHORUS. We ask not for riches but look to the cross. 'Cause you are the Lord. And for our inheritance give us the loss. You are the Lord. Send Your power. Oh, Lord, our God. Send Your power. Oh, Lord, our God. Oh, Lord, our God    </segment1>
