		<segment1>
I'm ready to go. Got my head packed in my bag. It's knowledge you know. This is how I got myself trapped. Deceived I'm holding hands with. The liar, my foe. But let me run my mouth no. Are you my friend or foe?</segment1>
		<segment2>Your mouth runs quicker than your heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Are they really being fed? Yeah. The people you spit to. When you walk away are they. Uplifted or does their face sink. And their eyes go dead. And you call yourself a Christian. Do you really want to serve Him. Or fill your stomach with pride?</segment3>
		<segment4>Congratulations. That's a book one hundred and two. No hesitation. To rip down your brother and your sister too. Better show some hesitation. With your predestination</segment4>
		<segment5>Predestination. All you have hesitation. To look with your heart</segment5>
		<segment6>To look with your heart. You think you know everything. Those who know God. Are known by God. Predestination. Is hesitation</segment6>
		<segment7>This is how the song ends. I pray it steals your peace and. You begin to look in. Mr. Calvin-ist man
