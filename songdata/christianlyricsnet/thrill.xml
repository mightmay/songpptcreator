		<segment1>Would you move, move in this life. My heart is numb and cold from the night. Ignite the fire and the passion again. Lord would you reveal remind me how to feel </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Would you thrill would you fill. Get under my skin. Make me to be what you want me to be. Would you thrill would fill get under my skin. Get into my head </segment2>
		<segment3>Move in my soul would you make me whole. Would you move, move in this heart. Open the doors that kept us apart. Ive been running and chasing the wind. Ive been breathing in the fumes and choking on my sin</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
