		<segment1>Enemy familiar friend. My beginning and my end. Knowing truth, whispering lies. And it hurts again</segment1>
		<segment2>What I fear and what I try. The words I say and what I hide. All the pain, I want it to end. But I want it again</segment2>
		<segment3>And it finds me. The fight inside is coursing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is breaking me again</segment3>
		<segment4>It's still the same, pursuing pain. Isn't worth the light I've gained. We both know how this will end. But I do it again</segment4>
		<segment5>And it finds me. The fight inside is coursing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is hurting me again</segment5>
		<segment6>And it finds me. The war within me pulls me under. And without you. The fight inside is breaking me again</segment6>
		<segment7>It's nothing. (It's everything). It's nothing. (It's everything)</segment7>
		<segment8>It's nothing. (It's everything). It's nothing. It's everything</segment8>
		<segment9>And it finds me. The fight inside is coursing through my veins. And it's raging. The fight inside is hurting me again</segment9>
		<segment10>And it finds me. The war within me pulls me under. And without you. The fight inside is breaking me again</segment10>
		<segment11>It's breaking me, it's breaking me. I'm falling apart, I'm falling apart.     </segment11>
