		<segment1>Its funny I was just thinking about. how much we used to get caught up in the clouds, questioning each other. And then you called and you asked me where I was today. Just like every other. Well, I just I know that sometimes were more distant than others.</segment1>
		<segment2>It doesnt stop. but I dont let that hinder me. My plans got longevity. It doesnt stop. Give it a shot. Let me make the pitch, you choose. Well dial it in just right for you.</segment2>
		<segment3>When you see me again dont abstain. Theres a mighty demand. When you see me again will you recognize?. Will we both understand theres some kind of love allocated for us?</segment3>
		<segment4>Let me know. Because the things you say. come together in a charming way. Because words you choose. to say to me definitely elude to something. I dont want to make believe. Steer the boat or live the fantasy. All the better, let the magnet pull. scratch my wounds I think youre healing me, healing me. Because the things you say. come together in a charming way. I dont want to make believe. Steer the boat or live the fantasy. All the better, let the magnet pull. scratch my wounds I think youre healing me, healing me.</segment4>
		<segment5>The weight is falling down on us. The weight is falling down on us. When you see me again, dont abstain. Theres a mighty demand. When you see me again will you recognize?. Will we both understand theres some kind of love allocated for us.     </segment5>
