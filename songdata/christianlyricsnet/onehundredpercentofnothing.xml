		<segment1>I Tried To Analize And Understand. Rationalize And Comprehend. I'm Trying But I'm Failing Now. I Need The Common Sense I've. Lost Along The Way, Or Never Had. It's Obviously Gone</segment1>
		<segment2>I Tried To Compromise And Spread It Thin. I Played The Odds And Lost It All. I'm Sinking Too Fast To Call Out. You'll Never Hear Me Crying. I Tried To Go Your Way, What Can I Say. I Guess I Never Wanted It Or Wanted To Be. The Way You Wanted It For Me. I Wish I Could Have Given It To You. I Guess We'll Have To Wait And See</segment2>
		<segment3>Give Me Some Time Away. And Let Me Sleep On It. I Have A Long Life Still Ahead Of Me. For Now I'll Start With An Apology. Cause I Admit It, I Regret It. Now I'm On The Outside. Of The Circle I Thought I'd Be In. Go On This Way I'll Never Make It Through. I'll Rip A Thousand Parts Into. A Million Pieces, I've Spread Myself Thin. And Nothings Getting Done</segment3>
