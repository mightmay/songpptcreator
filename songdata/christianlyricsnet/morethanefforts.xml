		<segment1>You can make the difference. A never changing, ongoing situation. Pain covers pain. Don't cheapen the mood. It's all out on the table. Like a noose around my neck. I'm in the middle of a possible disaster. It never ceases this struggle, this pain. Battling between good and evil. I'll have these hands be strong. Set my heart to burn. We won't be held down by compromise. It never made me strong. One battle, one sword, one fight, one war    </segment1>
