		<segment1>Lord are You still coming?. This world is all in shame. Everything is broken. But You remain</segment1>
		<segment2>Have mercy on me, Jesus. I can't take one more step. The lights go out all around me</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to see Your face. I want to hear Your voice. I want to lay my burden down. I want to run to You. Forever dance with You. I long for night to end. Lord let Your day begin</segment3>
		<segment4>The sons of men are hiding. Pretending to be free. They're yearing to escape You. For liberty</segment4>
		<segment5>But I want to see Your face. I want to hear Your voice. I want to lay my burden down. I want to run to You. Forever dance with You. I long for night to end. Lord let Your day begin. Let it come, Lord</segment5>
		<segment6>All I want, Lord Jesus. Only You can give. When the light goes out all around me</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to see Your face. I want to hear Your voice. I want to lay my burden down (mm hm). I want to run to You. Forever dance with You. I long for night to end. Lord let Your day begin</segment7>
		<segment8>I want to see Your face. I want to hear Your voice. I want to lay my burden down. I want to run to You. Forever dance with You. I long for night to end. Lord let Your day begin. Let it come, Lord    </segment8>
