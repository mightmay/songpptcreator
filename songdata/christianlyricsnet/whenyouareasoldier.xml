		<segment1>When you are a soldier I will be your shield. I will go with you into the battlefield. And when the arrows start to fly. Take my hand and hold on tight. I will be your shield, 'cause I know how it feels. When you are a soldier</segment1>
		<segment2>When you're tired from running. I will cheer you on. Look beside you and you'll see you're not alone. And when your strength is all but gone. I'll carry you until you're strong. And I will be your shield 'cause I know how it feels. When you're a soldier</segment2>
		<segment3>I will be the one you can cry your songs to. My eyes will share your tears. And I'll be your friend if you win. Or if you're defeated. Whenever you need me I will be here</segment3>
		<segment4>When you're lost in darkness I will hold the light. I will help you find your way through the night. I'll remind you of the truth. And keep the flame alive in you. And I will be your shield. 'Cause I know how it feels. When you are a soldier.     </segment4>
