		<segment1>The world's best has dragged you through it all. A child of misery and dissolutions. Wading in the sorrows. A benchmark of disappointments. I'll make every effort to carry your burdens. Getting past these trying times so you won't be overthrown. A friend loves at all times. I still care. We'll get through this together. Have you found what you've been looking for?. You're still waiting for more love. I'll be waiting for your roots to flourish once more. And your neglect for vision to be restored. Pushing for time to let go (hours and hours). It's never easy wanting something more. It's a promise, one you can't out grow. Choices and changes you made. But it's still the same. It's a promise    </segment1>
