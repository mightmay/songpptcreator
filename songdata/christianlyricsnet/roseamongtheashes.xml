		<segment1>Staring out the window. Memories of you and I. I never wanted things to be like this. You'll always be close to my heart. And I will never forget the times we've had. </segment1>
		<segment2>For you my friend, I miss the times. I don't want this all to be the end. Understanding won't mean a thing. It's hard to deal with what's come between us. </segment2>
		<segment3>I'll hope that one day you'll forgive. Though I've been foolish with your trust. Percussion!. The heat that drove my life for two years, let's not make this the end. </segment3>
		<segment4>For you my friend, I miss the times. I don't want this all to be the end. Understanding won't mean a thing. It's hard to deal with what's come between us. </segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, no. Watch out, I'm coming back my friend. I'm sorry for the things I've done. For you my friend. Remember our talks till three a.m. It feels like it was just yesterday. Please take this plea because it's all I have. Please take my plea because it's all I have     </segment5>
