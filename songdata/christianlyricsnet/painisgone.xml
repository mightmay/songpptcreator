		<segment1>Take my rage. Hide it in your fists. It's all for you. It's all I can do.</segment1>
		<segment2>And believe me when I say, That I'll pay you back some day, When you're standing all alone, With nothing of your own.</segment2>
		<segment3>Bury my burdens. Have fun controlling me.</segment3>
		<segment4>Cast all my cares upon, Your weary shoulders. Heed my words to you. Because what I say is true. This is something we discussed. I want the best for us.</segment4>
		<segment5>Reaching out, desperately. Broken dreams, you and me. Reaching out, tragically. Dead beliefs, you and me.</segment5>
		<segment6>Now my pain is gone. The pain is gone. I'm moving on.    </segment6>
