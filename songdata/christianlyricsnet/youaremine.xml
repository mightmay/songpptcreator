		<segment1>It doesn't take much. For my heart to break. And you have done it. For what's seems the millionth time</segment1>
		<segment2>Whenever I hear. Of your saving grace. And how you gave your life. In exchange for mine</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes I wonder why you even love me. And why you ever chose to call me child. Then I remember. It's by your sacrifice. I can say that. I am yours and you are mine</segment3>
		<segment4>It doesn't take much. For me to shed a tear. And you have done so many things. To make me cry. Whenever I think. Of all that I've done wrong. And everything that you have done. To make it right</segment4>
		<segment5>It doesn't take much. For my heart to break. And you have done it. For what's seems the millionth time    </segment5>
