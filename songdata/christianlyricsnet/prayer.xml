		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman and John Elefante. Based on 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18, Ephesians 6:18-19, Matthew 6:9-13</segment1>
		<segment2>First I want to thank You Lord for being who You are. For coming to the rescue of a man who's drifted far. For calling me to be Your son and calling me to serve. Lord the way You've blessed my life is more than I deserve </segment2>
		<segment3>Keep the ones I love so dearly. Fill their emptiness while I am gone. And fill the loneliness in me </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). This is my prayer. Lifted to You. Knowing You care even more than I do. This is my prayer. Lifted in Your name. Your will be done I humbly pray </segment4>
		<segment5>Let me be the evidence of what Your grace can do. To a generations struggling to find themselves in You. May they come to know the love of God. May their eyes be made to see. Give me the opportunity to share the truth that sets them free. And may unity in all things. Be the banner of Your church. And let revival's fire begin to burn </segment5>
		<segment6>As we face the last and final hours. Turn a wayward country back to You. And keep us from the evil that devours. Keep us on the path and lead us through. Keep us in Your light until Your kingdom comes. And our work is done </segment6>
		<segment7>This is my prayer. Lifted to You. Knowing You care so much more than I do. This is my prayer. In Jesus' name. Your will be done I humbly pray. This is my prayer    </segment7>
