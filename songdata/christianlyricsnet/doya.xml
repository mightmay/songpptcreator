		<segment1>Do ya like the freckles on my face?. Do ya like my teeth they're out of place?. I'd like to think so. Do ya like the funny way I speak?. I don't clean my room for weeks.sad weeks. I'd like to think so </segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Do ya, do ya, do ya love me?. Do ya..d-d-do ya love me?. I..I'd like to think so. Do ya, do ya, do ya love me?. Do ya..d-d-do ya love me?. Anyway..I'd like to think so </segment2>
		<segment3>Do ya like the way I go all shy?. I just can't look you in the eye?. I'd like to think so. Will you stay here for a while?. So I can watch you when you smile. I'd like to think so </segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus) </segment4>
		<segment5>Well I hope I don't drive you insane. With my big right foot and my unkept mane. Well I know you love me the way I am. So I'll change my ways if I think that I can </segment5>
