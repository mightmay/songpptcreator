		<segment1>Fallen times have come. We can't turn and run. Stephen didn't fear the people, Not even when they stoned him to death. We can be like he was. C'mon, baby. (Don't fear the people). Baby, take your stand. (Don't fear the people). And be ready to die. (Don't fear the people). Baby, they're just men. When the fire was done. Nero burned Christians. Rome of old was full of men. Martyred for their Christianity. (Rome of old was full of men). Although they tried they couldn't kill them anyway. (Rome of old was full of men). The more that died the more that came to take their place. (Read in your history book). And now the Coliseum is an empty place. (We can be like they were). C'mon, baby. (Don't fear the people). Baby, take your stand. (Don't fear the people). And be ready to die. (Don't fear the people). Baby, they're just men. Harken to the one who was God's own Son. Fear not man in his madness. Who if he killed your body couldn't go on. The Lord's the only one that you should fear. The person who first put you here. Who can certainly do something more severe. (When you're thrown in the grave). C'mon baby. (That's the one to fear). Defend the faith. (Like the martyrs who died). Let's get back to the faith they had. (We can become like they were). They had taken a stand. (We can become like they were). C'mon baby. (Don't fear the people)    </segment1>
