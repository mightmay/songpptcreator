		<segment1>Yeah, Mr. Deeds has got you wrapped around his finger. With what you think you need to do to be delivered. You look for accidents so you can be the hero. You wrote the charity check that ends in double zeros. You help old ladies cross the street, You welcome homeless where you sleep. You give to everyone in need, You even hold a city key. Aren't you great?. But that's not good enough</segment1>
		<segment2>If you don't have faith you have nothing at all. If you don't have deeds your faith will fall. They can't be true without each other. you can't have one without the other</segment2>
		<segment3>You think that faith is where you sit on a sunday morning. You've got a front row seat where you can be seen snoring. Throughout the week you live your life inside a bubble. You find your happiness avoiding people's thoughts. Your life revolves around yourself, You don't treat others very well. You say your faith will get you by and that you won't be left behind. You might be right, but that's not good enough</segment3>
		<segment4>If you don't have deeds you have nothing at all. If you don't have faith your deeds will fall. They can't be true without each other. You can't have one without the other</segment4>
		<segment5>You know I can't see thinking. That I'd be better off living just for selfish ambition, no. I know that faith is more than just believing. We should do the right. Things, for the right reasons.     </segment5>
