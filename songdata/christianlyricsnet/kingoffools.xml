		<segment1>Waiting for you. Nothing in this world can bring me. Peace and madness. They've become the very best of friends</segment1>
		<segment2>Walking with you. Blindly follow out upon the. Water runs down. You've become the very best of friends</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll live for you and try to be the king of fools. I'll long for you and walk before the king of all</segment3>
		<segment4>Joy has found me. Living life without you would be. Hell or heaven. Soon we'll find the greatest king of fools</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll live for you and try to be the king of fools. I'll long just to walk before the king of fools.     </segment5>
