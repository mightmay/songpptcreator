		<segment1>For now you will deal with heartache, And for now you will face some pain. But now release all of your buried grief, You don't know how inside it lies your healing.</segment1>
		<segment2>Letting grease make away, Letting love take a place inside your heart now, You don't have to grasp, You just have to ask and peace will find you out.</segment2>
		<segment3>The peace is heavy tonight, Your will breaks out with the daylight.</segment3>
		<segment4>Even now you are being restored, And for now you don't fully understand. Even now your whole life's being bought for, By the one who calls himself &quot;I am&quot;.</segment4>
		<segment5>Letting grace make a wave, Letting love take a place inside your heart now, You don't have to grasp, You just have to ask and peace will find you out.</segment5>
		<segment6>The peace is heavy tonight, Your will breaks out with the daylight.</segment6>
		<segment7>All over the world darkness is pierced by light. All over the world, all over the world, darkness sucumbs to light.</segment7>
		<segment8>Letting grace make a wave, Letting love take a place inside your heart now, You don't have to grasp, You just have to ask and peace will find you out.</segment8>
		<segment9>Your heart feels it now, The grief is heavy tonight, Your will breaks out with the daylight. You heart feels it now.    </segment9>
