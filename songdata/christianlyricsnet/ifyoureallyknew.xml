		<segment1>If you really knew, you would change your mind. If you knew the God I know, you would have the time. If you take a chance, I know you would find. Everything you need in love of another kind</segment1>
		<segment2>What you don't know can lead you to the extremes. Shunning help though you feel a need. You fear to be caught limping and you lose your place. And leaning on the Everlasting Arms is not your taste. Maybe you've heard stories, Laughed at what you saw on TV. Or felt disgust as He was used as an excuse for bigotry. But I've got to tell you, that's not what it's all about. 'Cause the truth I know will turn you around</segment2>
		<segment3>I, too have been hurt by those who claimed to show the way. It was crazy, their two faces like night and day. But you don't stop believing 'cause you once been burned. In everything, there's a lesson learned. Man is imperfect, there is just One Perfect Soul. So much more loving than than one. that you've been shown, oh. How long is it gonna take for you to realize. I wish that you would open your eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>. I apologize to you on behalf of the untrue, because the God I know would. Never do the things they do. Mercy and compassion on the right and on the left. Can you give anymore than your last breath. Oh, too hard to see, well put your mind aside. Stop using fear to hide behind</segment4>
		<segment5>God's love is enough for. you and it's waiting, if you only knew    </segment5>
