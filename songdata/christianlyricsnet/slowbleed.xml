		<segment1>At times I find my mind unwinds and I don't think when I walk. Run into things and fall down. It's coming around again and I've found sometimes. I don't think when I talk. And put my foot in my mouth. And sometimes when I, I look at me. And wish I could be somebody else. Sometimes I throw myself and let go, but never no. Intention to see a picture of me and trap myself</segment1>
		<segment2>All this time, we've been mislead. ..Does anyone care atall?</segment2>
		<segment3>Sometimes I fall asleep and then I lose control. I try to find my way out without letting go. And will I lose my mind if it comes back this time?. If I don't turn out perfect will you be a friend of mine?</segment3>
		<segment4>It's coming around again and I've found somtimes thatI sit. When I should get up and just walk away. Sometimes I pretned and act like I do. But don't listen to a word you say. And sometimes when I start talking out loud. Should just shut my mouth and walk away. Somtimes I feel like maybe it's real and think like nobody else. Too close to myself and suffocate</segment4>
		<segment5>Are you ready to crawl out?. Are you ready to take my hand and see?. Are you ready to crawl out?. From within this slow bleed?. From within this slow bleed?. From within this slow bleed?. Take this away from me    </segment5>
