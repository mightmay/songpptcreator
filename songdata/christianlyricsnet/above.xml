		<segment1>For all those people I've met. Thinkin' I live my life in regret for all those choices I've made. I have the utmost respect for my Lord. He's given me. The ultimate reward. of life in heaven when I'm gone from here. I'll get goin when my Lord appears. So take time realize just one thing. To give it up cause He's your one KING</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus</segment2>
		<segment3>Everything to my God above. He's my one and only true love. Everything to my God above. He's my one and only true love. Everything I've dreamed of. Keeps me going through my day. And through my night and. Through my week. He's everything I'd ever want. Everything to my God above. He's my one and only true love</segment3>
		<segment4>Here I go again I get myself a paper and pen. Sit down start to pray and I write about my life of sin. All those years when I didn't know Him. Well now I do and His love is showin'. Everything He's ever done everything He'll ever do. Take Him inside He'll do the same thing for you. I know you think you can talk the talk. Let me see you do it now. Let me see you walk the walk. Those skies come down to take me home    </segment4>
