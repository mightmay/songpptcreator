		<segment1>Let the earth resound with songs of praise. To the Father's power and love;. For the One who set each star in place. Chose to set His heart on us. To the One whose might gives victory, Yet whose mercies never cease;. As the tapestry of history. Tells the story of His grace.</segment1>
		<segment2>King immortal, Faithful God. Crowned with splendour, rich in love. Let the heavens and the earth resound. With songs of praise to You.</segment2>
		<segment3>Let the earth be stilled before the sight. Of a Father's sacrifice -. That revealed the depths of love divine. In the face of Jesus Christ. Through a life of full obedience. And a death in agony, He removed the rebel's punishment. And He set the prisoner free</segment3>
		<segment4>Let the earth resound with songs of faith. At the wonder yet to come, When all sin and pain are put to death. And the church and Christ are one. When we stand as God's great family. And we meet the Father's gaze, And we share in His eternal joy. As we join in ceaseless praise.     </segment4>
