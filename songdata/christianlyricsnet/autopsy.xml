		<segment1>If my body was broken open and you could look inside. Would you only find flesh. Just the useless parts of an obsolete machine. Would there be any sign of life. Or would you only find death. Would there be any evidence of a human soul trying to escape. If a flame once burned within this shell. Set me on fire one last time. Is there a clear division of soul and spirit marrow and joint. Can the human body still give you glory even in death. May the ashes tell the story of what work was done within. May my soul pause to witness as this body goes up in flame. Set me on fire</segment1>
