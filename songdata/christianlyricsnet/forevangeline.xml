		<segment1>in one night you made me your own the deepest embrace's creation i layed there for days and you forgot in one night you made me your own in one hour you gave me away to the angels you sent me up to the sky now their wings fan the heat from the face you'll never see the hair you'll never smell the little hands you'll never hold now i am but a silhouette down there a silhouette of a memory of a solitary night nothing more.</segment1>
