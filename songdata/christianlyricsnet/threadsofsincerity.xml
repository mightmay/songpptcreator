		<segment1>Anywhere I go, anywhere my feet take me. Your compassion never fails me. I've gotten so far away. Alone and close to giving up. Can I lay down these ways not in vain?. Your love is the greatest thing. I will look ahead to see the truth in this, to see the truth in me. Closer, closer to you. I need it to last more than a moment, these times with you. The rhythm skips a beat and I hold the weight of the world. To the touch I ache, to the look I seem to be a mistake. These mistakes I've made hold me back from the days I should spend with you. To be long term and long lasting. To overcome the lines and the rules. There are days when I'm right where I'm supposed to be. But mostly I am far away. I'm learning to live the way I should. I'm learning to love the way you should. And today it's been made clear that I've walked so far alone. It's easy wanting something more. I will dive.. closer to you..    </segment1>
