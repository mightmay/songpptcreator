		<segment1>Ain't got no halo, no wings to fly away. I've got to labor, for many many days. I'm on a journey, I'm looking for a place. To rest by burdens, far from this tyranny</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: From the shores of Africa. Up to the doors of America. With voices to heaven praying for liberty. We cry freedom (freedom, freedom, freedom). x4</segment2>
		<segment3>We marched in 'Bama. We marched in Tennesee. Brown men and white men. Stood for equality. We kept our chin up. We kept our dignity. And our proclamation. Let everbody sing</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Up on Golgotha, hanging upon a tree. They say the God-man, died for my liberty. He heard me crying, from my captivity. And so he came down, down to deliver me. Woah woah woah woah</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Our hearts cry freedom. My heart cries freedom. Your heart cries freedom. His heart cries freedom. Woo.     </segment7>
