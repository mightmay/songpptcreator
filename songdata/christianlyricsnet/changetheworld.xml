		<segment1>I'm finding it hard, hard to take. Mistakes we have made. Ignoring the ones. that we hold dear. Out of selfishness</segment1>
		<segment2>All these things distract. our eyes and steal our time</segment2>
		<segment3>Why do we keep fighting, but saying everything's alright?. We all see the same things why can't we stand side by side?. United together, we can change the world</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm learning to take the smallest steps, and making a way. Can You take anymore?. Can You stand by while our world crashes down?</segment4>
		<segment5>Be the spark, forsake your pride, set things right    </segment5>
