		<segment1>Autumn brings a song I sing so desperately. These shattered dreams. From broken wings of love. October skies and city lights were all a blur. And high tide came washing them away. I said</segment1>
		<segment2>Alright, alright, alright. You make the calls tonight. I surrender, this is for real</segment2>
		<segment3>Church bells ring. the North Star seems so far from me. The costal plane's is where my shame shall lay. Autumn trees they shed their leaves. to live again. The cold air brings clarity to me..yeah. I said</segment3>
		<segment4>Alright, alright, alright. You make the calls tonight. I surrender, this is for real. Alright, alright, alright. You make the calls tonight. I surrender, to your love</segment4>
		<segment5>I, I've been running to nowhere. And I, I feel something's getting clear oohhh. I said. Alright, alright, alright. You make the calls tonight. I surrender, this is for real. Alright, alright, alright. You make the calls tonight. I surrender, to your love</segment5>
		<segment6>Alright, alright, alright. You make the calls tonight. I surrender, this is for real. Alright, alright, alright. You make the calls tonight. I surrender, to your love</segment6>
