		<segment1>i'm a fair-weather friend. i'm a colorless view. but i'm willin' to make a deal. if you think you can make some faith here inside. i'll drive off and marry you</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: i'm only alive with you. i can't get by and i won't get through. so put me in the river and let me say i do. i'm only alive with you</segment2>
		<segment3>you're a sight for sore eyes. and a newborn cry. in a year where there are so few. if you throw me a line, i'll show you in time. i'm fallin' in love with you</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS]</segment4>
		<segment5>though my heart has been torn. the loves i have worn. and i'm tempted by them ever still. i tremble inside when you walk in the room. you hold my affections and will</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS x 2]    </segment6>
