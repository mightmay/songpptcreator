		<segment1>I walk the line. Leave it all behind. I've been waiting forever. Let's go back in time. When I could read your mind. So I've been waitin'. It took a season's going by. To know it's not my fault</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). I tried to be perfect. Tried to be honest. Tried to be everything that you ever wanted. I tried to be stronger. Tried to be smarter. Tried to be everything but you..</segment2>
		<segment3>It's been so long. Since you've been home. I used to wait up forever. Used to say a prayer. Wishing you were there. And I'm still waiting..</segment3>
		<segment4>You told me once. You'd show up, But I fell for that before. I fell to pieces</segment4>
		<segment5>Then I woke up to no one. Just a picture of Jesus. And a house left in pieces. And it took a season's going by. To know it's not my fault.</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>I want you. I need you. I want to believe you. I want you. I need you. I want to believe you</segment7>
		<segment8>I tried be perfect. Tried to be honest. Tried to be everything but you..    </segment8>
