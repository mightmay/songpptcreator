		<segment1>I've been running with my soul so tired about you. I've been running with my soul so tired, how about you? </segment1>
		<segment2>Could you walk if I was stumbling?. Could you stand if I was crumbling?. Could you, darling, would you give me a brighter day?. You'd give me a brighter day, a brighter day, a brighter day. Could you, darling, would we get away? </segment2>
		<segment3>I've been lying in my head so tired about you. I've been lying in my head so tired, how about you? </segment3>
