		<segment1>Saturday night's a lie I follow every cue. Sunday is sanctified I smile and take the pew. Monday its back to school. Am I learning, not at all. Tuesday and Wednesday Thursday Friday I just crawl</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Gotta fight, gotta stop living a lie. Gotta fall, gotta lay down and die. Gotta stand and run to the other side. Gotta live or its murder by pride</segment2>
		<segment3>Seeds that were growing have dried up by my flesh. I walk the walk and talk the talk but wheres the rest. I could have everything even what's behind the stars. But I built my prison without windows without bars</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Gotta fight, gotta stop living a lie. Gotta fall, gotta lay down and die. Gotta stand and run to the other side. Gotta live or its murder by pride</segment4>
		<segment5>guitar solo</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus. Gotta fight, gotta stop living a lie. Gotta fall, gotta lay down and die. Gotta stand and run to the other side. Gotta live or its murder by pride     </segment6>
