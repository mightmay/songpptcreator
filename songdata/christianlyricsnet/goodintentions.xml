		<segment1>Why do I do things that hurt you?. Intentions start out good, but end up twisted. All of the time I fall away then come running back when hurt. You open your scarred hands to catch me when I fall. Every time it happens you're right there. I could never repay my debt, but you don't' ask me to. That is why I love you. Why must my heart be so corrupt when I can't stand it?. You show your favor on me anyway. Teach me to obey. You open you scarred hands to catch me when I fall. Every time it happens you're right there. I could never repay my debt, but you don't ask me to. That is why love you.     </segment1>
