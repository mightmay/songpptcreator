		<segment1>It feels as cold as winter time. In my heart and in my mind. It leaves me aching for the light. I feel so numb and paralyzed</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, won't you break my heart for what breaks yours?. Fan the flames inside this brittle shell</segment2>
		<segment3>I wanna be a love revolution. I wanna be a part of the solution. I wanna be a love revolution. So take me now to the heart of the movement. All of us are standing on the edge of the love revolution</segment3>
		<segment4>Come and let your mercy flow. Through our hearts and through our souls. And can we be your hands and feet. To carry healing, light, and peace</segment4>
		<segment5>You've called me to wear the glory of your name. So help me, I wanna wear it well</segment5>
		<segment6>I wanna be a love revolution. I wanna be a part of the solution. I wanna be a love revolution. So take me now to the heart of the movement. All of us are standing on the edge of the love revolution</segment6>
		<segment7>So let your light shine. In my life. I'm ready to sing. Take my heart now. Take it all. I give it away. Make your light shine. In my life. I'm ready to sing</segment7>
		<segment8>I wanna be a love revolution. I wanna be a part of the solution. I wanna be a love revolution. So take me now to the heart of the movement. All of us are standing on the edge. All of us are standing on the edge. Of the love revolution. Love revolution    </segment8>
