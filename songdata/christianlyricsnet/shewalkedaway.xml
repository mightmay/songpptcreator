		<segment1>She couldn't take one more day. Home was more her prison now. Independence called out. She had to get it </segment1>
		<segment2>A fight was all she needed. To give her reason. She slammed the door with no goodbye. And knew that it was time</segment2>
		<segment3>Now she's driving to fast. She didn't care to glance behind. And through her tears she laughed. It's time to kiss the past goodbye</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm finally on my own. Don't try to tell me no. There's so much more for me. Just watch what I will be</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus. She walked away. Couldn't say why she was leaving. She walked away. She left all she had believed in. she walked away</segment5>
		<segment6>Not a day goes by. For the ones she's left behind. They're always asking &quot;why?&quot;. And thoughts of her consume her mind</segment6>
		<segment7>God please let her know. The love we tried to show. We'd promise anything. If you'd just bring her home</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>Bridge. Tell her we love her. Tell her she's wanted. And one more thing God. Tell her please, come home. Please, come home</segment9>
		<segment10>Chorus (2x)</segment10>
		<segment11>The choice is yours alone now. Tell me how this story..ends    </segment11>
