		<segment1>Stand for what you care about and pick each other up when you fall down. It hurts to scrape your pride. Compensate for misspelled lies and where we are will change with time. Brotherhood will fall in line. You had your chance now it's our turn. Come together over me. Pick your head up of the ground to see. We're there. We have a chance. Don't turn your head to take another glance. It hurts to scrape your pride. Compensate for mistrust eyes and where you are will change with rhyme. Brotherhood will die in time. Everything dies.    </segment1>
