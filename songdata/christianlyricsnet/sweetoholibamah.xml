		<segment1>1-2-3 (Ive heard enough). Bigamy was Esau's burden. I married me girls who grieved my kin. Im bringin someone now to solve that. I just got married once again  I'm takin' a chance, yes. Well, I heard what my mom thinks about them (Mothers mad). Well, her dirty deal put me down. Well, I hope my mom will remember. Her son who ran won't be around anyhow. Sweet Oholibamah, youre my wife thats the truth. Sweet Oholibamah, youre just one of quite a few. Im burning mad, but I love my mother, now (Boo hoo hoo). But she's tied in with Jacobs ruse. While brother Jacob was robbin' me. Mother conned my father, too  I'm tellin' the truth. Sweet Oholibamah, all my wives are so blue. They dont love my mama cause my mama dont approve. (Here it comes, melodrama). Now Mother goes and talks to Papa. Let Jacob go and pick a wife or two (Aint she cute). Oh, that ticks me off so much. It ticks me off 'cause he flew the coop  Now, I might sue. Sweet Oholibamah, yeah, my wives arent amused. We gonna have a problem if we go on Family Feud. Sweet Oholibamah (oh, sweetheart). Yeah, my wives arent so few (but my love is true). Even though Im not monogamous (oh, no). Youre my one and only too    </segment1>
