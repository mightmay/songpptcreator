		<segment1>Put back the stars. I'm out of shape tonight. Pinhole black velvet. Navigation-skills got lost with the fading light. It was there not more than a second ago. Now what do you know, what I do know. Is just not good enough to make things right. Put back the stars. I'm out of place tonight</segment1>
		<segment2>Ain't it something to know you're lost</segment2>
		<segment3>I hoist my sail. Though there is no wind in sight. And I close my eyes to feel the fresh breeze. Paint the inside of my eyelids bright. Fill the sky with Your breath. Cause You know I'm out of mine. Let the sky burn and I will inhale. Without a fight. I hoist my sail. And I'll just wait for You tonight</segment3>
		<segment4>Ain't it something to know you have lost</segment4>
		<segment5>Black tar surrounds me now. But life is the next door neighbor. On the outside there is just absence. But when I close my eyes. All I see is Your face</segment5>
		<segment6>Ain't it something to know you've lost. Ain't it something to know you've lost. Ain't it something I know I've lost    </segment6>
