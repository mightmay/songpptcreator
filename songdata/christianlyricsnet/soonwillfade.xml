		<segment1>EVERYBODYS TALKIN BOUT THE NEW SENSATION. EVERYBODYS CLAIMING ITS THE NEXT BIG THING. AND I AM ALWAYS QUICK TO FALL FOR THAT TEMPTATION. YEAH IM THE FIRST IN LINE FOR THE GRAND OPENING</segment1>
		<segment2>EVERYONES PREDICTING ITLL SWEEP THE NATION. SAYING IF YOU TRY IT ITLL BLOW YOUR MIND. AND THOUGH THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH CHASING INNOVATION. YOURE THE ONLY ONE THATS EVER CHANGED MY LIFE</segment2>
		<segment3>WE ARE LIVING IN A WORLD THAT LONGS FOR CHANGE. CAUSE WERE ALL SEARCHING FOR A LOVE THAT WILL REMAIN. YEAH THE DAY WILL COME WHEN WELL SEE LOVE AND ITS BEAUTIFUL FACE. BUT WERE ALL LIVING IN A WORLD THAT SOON WILL FADE</segment3>
		<segment4>EVERYBODYS LOOKING FOR A TRUE CONTENTMENT. SEARCHING FOR SOME PLEASURE THAT WILL LAST THEM AWHILE. BUT ALL THATS LEFT INSIDE IS GUILT AND STRONG RESENTMENT. THIS WORLD ONLY PROVIDES A TEMPORARY SMILE</segment4>
		<segment5>(THAT SOON WILL) FADE AWAY WITH STARS AND THE MOON. TIL THERES ONLY LOVE AND TRUTH     </segment5>
