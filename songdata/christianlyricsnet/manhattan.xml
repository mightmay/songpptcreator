		<segment1>Let me in, I've got to be near you. Let the song begin. Just let me hear you. Oh pretty baby don't leave me all. alone on my knees. Oh please, you'll like me. I'll show you. What will be will be, just let me know you. One two now you and me could be so hot. We got a lot, tell me now why not?. Play me out, make me shout. Tell me what you really feel so I. can see what you're about. I'll do all I can just to chase away your doubts. I'm here let me wash away your fear. Hey dear, let me hear what you're. doing way over there. You see you'll like me I'll show you. What will be will be, just let me know you. One two now you and me could be so hot. We got a lot, tell me now why not?. Come on and jump the wire, you give my soul desire. Send me baby. Be a little crazy! Like the first. time fall in love. We read it in the stars above. Repeat    </segment1>
