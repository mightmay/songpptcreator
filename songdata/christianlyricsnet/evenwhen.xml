		<segment1>This week, I prayed, one time. My phone, it rang, I put You on the other line. And now my thoughts they drift around. My knees remain unacquainted with the ground. Unless my faith is put to the test and I am forced to bow. Although I'm in this flesh it doesn't mean You shouldn't have the best. from me, from me</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. Even when my eyes are dry. even when my soul is tired. even when my hands are heavy, I will lift them up to Yu. It's not about how I feel, oh Lord I am here for Yu. I exist for you</segment2>
		<segment3>I close my eyes but all I see. Is a background of black, bouncy squiggly lines. And this week's mistakes coming back to mind but. I will lift my voice and make a joyful sound. Forget about me, I only get me down. Although I cannot see it doesn't mean I shouldn't sing to You, to You</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>You've given me Your life and have held mine together yet I find. Excuses to slouch in my pew. But when glory divine. Is sitting in my very presence, the least that I can do. Is give my all to You, give my all to You</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
