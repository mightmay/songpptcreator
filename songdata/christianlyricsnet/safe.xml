		<segment1>Set me as a seal upon your heart. Take my life, its a spark</segment1>
		<segment2>Its only you and you alone. That I want to get to know. Its in your arms I am safe. Every knee will come and bow. Ever only all for Thee. Its in your arms I am safe</segment2>
		<segment3>Jealousy as cruel as the grave is cruel. And its flames are flames of fire</segment3>
