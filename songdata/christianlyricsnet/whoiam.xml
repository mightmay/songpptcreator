		<segment1>I need someone who's a lot like you. Easy to see that I sure need something new. Though I try to live life my way. I think it goes to prove. That I need to be someone who's like you</segment1>
		<segment2>And I know that you want to change me. Want to rearrange the way I feel inside. Yes, I've heard that you take. The broken hearts of lonely souls. And make all things right</segment2>
		<segment3>Do you know who I am?. Have you seen the things I've done?</segment3>
		<segment4>Never before, no there's never been a time. That I would implore you to take what's yours and mine. And to use it in the way you will. In any way you find. Never before did I realize    </segment4>
