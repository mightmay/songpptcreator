		<segment1>Words and music by Bob Hartman. Based on Genesis 3:15, Matthew 28:6, John 20:19, Revelation 6:2</segment1>
		<segment2>He came alone into the battle. He knew nobody else could face His foe. He left His throne, He left His glory. He knew nobody else could ever go. He called the bluff, He took the challenge. He came into this world to seek and save. No one could know, no one could fathom. The way to win was only through the grave. They laid Him in His tomb. They thought they'd sealed His doom. But He rose. He rose! </segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). He came, He saw, He conquered death and hell. He came, He saw, He is alive and well. He was, He is, and only He forgives. He died, He rose, He lives. He came, He saw, He conquered! </segment3>
		<segment4>The doors were locked, they heard Him knocking. They were afraid they would be taken, too. Familiar voice said, &quot;Come and follow&quot;. Come and see the things the Lord can do. They went to where He lay. The stone was rolled away. He rose. He rose! </segment4>
		<segment5>He came into this world. He saw humanity. He heard the SOS. He met the enemy. The enemy was conquered. The enemy was conquered!     </segment5>
