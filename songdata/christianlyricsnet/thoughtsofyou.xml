		<segment1>Thoughts of You and how You changed me. Fill my mind. Without You where would I be</segment1>
		<segment2>So even though I've tried to express my thanks. It never comes out how I hoped. I want to say so much more so with these simple words. I'll try</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. I love You. My heart is Yours, only Yours. I long to give You all of me. My everything, my everything</segment3>
		<segment4>God I never could repay You. You gave everything. Without You where would I be</segment4>
		<segment5>You still loved me even when I. Pushed You away. You stood there and waited. Till the day I'd return    </segment5>
