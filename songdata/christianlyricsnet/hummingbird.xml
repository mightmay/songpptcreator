		<segment1>Feathered, tethered. Feels like all the world's a cage. Worked up, run down. In this race to earn a wage. Something &quot; inside. Tells me I was made to. Split the sky. Tell me why I'm</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Living like a hummingbird. (hungry for the blue). Getting nowhere fast from all my work. (stuck inside this view). If you've got one eye on the sparrow, Lord. (I'm standing still for you). Could you spare one for the hummingbird</segment2>
		<segment3>Dead lines, this grind. Got me beating gainst the wind. Want more from life. Than just spinning round and getting by. Not satisfied just</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Save me from this discontenting. Never ending, spirit bending. Pattern, I go round and round and. Round and round and round again. Yea I'm stuck inside this circle I just. Know there's better out there because. I can feel it in my wings, so I sing     </segment5>
