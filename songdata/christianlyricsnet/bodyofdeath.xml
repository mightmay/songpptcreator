		<segment1>What a wretched man I am!. Who will deliver me from this body of death?. Yes, I am carnal, sold as a slave to my sin.</segment1>
		<segment2>For in my inner being I delight in Gods law, but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind, making me prisoner to the law of sin at work within my members.</segment2>
		<segment3>Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors.. Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors.. through Him who loved us.</segment3>
		<segment4>What a wretched man I am!. Who will deliver me from this body of death?. Thanks be to God  through Jesus Christ our Lord.    </segment4>
