		<segment1>A big black book in her small fragile hands. The words she read I was so young to understand. Between the thees and thous and verilys. I watch my grandma live the truth in front of me</segment1>
		<segment2>A little boy wakes from a dream in the night. Runs down the hall to where she left on the light. But I stopped when I saw her down on her knees. Where she prayed every night for me. In a whisper I heard</segment2>
		<segment3>Jesus the keeper of this life. You are my refuge my savior my guide. Watch over this little one tonight. And guard his every footstep as he travels this life. And in some quit moment draw him to Your side. That he may come to know You Jesus. As the keeper of this life</segment3>
		<segment4>Well thirty years have come and gone since that time. And I can still see my grandmas face in my little boys eyes. And you will find me tonight somewhere down on my knees. As I whisper a prayer that was once prayed for me</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus the keeper of this life. You are my refuge my savior my guide. Watch over my little girl tonight. And guard her every footstep as she travels this life. And in some quit moment draw her to Your side. That she may come to know You Jesus. As I have come to know You Jesus. As the keeper of this life    </segment5>
