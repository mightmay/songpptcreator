		<segment1>You stood before creation. Eternity in your hand. You spoke the earth into motion. My soul now to stand</segment1>
		<segment2>You stood before my failure. And carried the cross for my shame. My sin weighed upon your shoulders. My soul now to stand</segment2>
		<segment3>So what could I say?. And what could I do?. But offer this heart, Oh God. Completely to you</segment3>
		<segment4>So I'll walk upon salvation. Your spirit alive in me. This life to declare your promise. My soul now to stand</segment4>
		<segment5>So what could I say?. And what could I do?. But offer this heart, Oh God. Completely to you</segment5>
		<segment6>I'll stand. With arms high and heart abandoned. In awe of the one who gave it all. I'll stand. My soul Lord to you surrendered. All I am is yours     </segment6>
