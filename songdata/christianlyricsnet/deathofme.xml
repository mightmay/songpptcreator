		<segment1>I should have seen those signs all around me, But I was comfortable inside these wounds;. So go ahead and take another piece of me now. While we all bow down to you;</segment1>
		<segment2>You tear me down and then you pick me up, You take it all and still its not enough, You try to tell me you can heal me, But Im still bleeding and youll be. The death of me!</segment2>
		<segment3>How can you end my affliction. If youre the sickness and Im the cure?. Too long Ive faked this addiction, Another sacrifice to make us pure;</segment3>
		<segment4>You tear me down and then you pick me up, You take it all and still its not enough, You try to tell me you can heal me, But Im still bleeding and youll be. The death of me!</segment4>
		<segment5>You tear me down and then you pick me up, You take it all and still its not enough, You try to tell me you can heal me, But Im still bleeding and youll be. The death of me!</segment5>
		<segment6>I wont forget;. I cannot forget this;. I wont forget;. Ill never forget this;. I wont forget;. I cannot forget this;. I wont forget;. Ill never forget this;</segment6>
		<segment7>I wont forget!. I cannot forget this!. I wont forget!. Ill never forget!</segment7>
		<segment8>You know I can never prove this solution;. You arent the one that I thought you were;. And so I learn to embrace this illusion, The line that separates- it starts to blur;</segment8>
		<segment9>You tear me down and then you pick me up, You take it all and say its not enough, You try to tell me you can heal me, But Im still bleeding and youll be. The death of me!</segment9>
		<segment10>And youll be the death of me!</segment10>
		<segment11>I will not forget!. I cannot forget this!. And youll be the death of me!    </segment11>
