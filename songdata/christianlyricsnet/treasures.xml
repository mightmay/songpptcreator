		<segment1>Night has found its way here. And all I can hear are memories shrill and clear. Like today man had his way. And stole and what I made. He saw that I was sincere</segment1>
		<segment2>So use me up, then throw me away. Build your careers and friendships. Quote on Quote and frankly Im ashamed. That I left my name on her lips. Cause when it ends theyll swear it is</segment2>
		<segment3>So Ill fall asleep and try not to think twice. About all the things that forever. Will kick me down the steps. For being too nice. Cause everyones searching for treasure</segment3>
		<segment4>And theyll just dig, dig, dig. Until they cant get out. And die in dirty digging for treasure. But as for me Im giving up and I'll take my bag. And focus on my treasure forever. Yes, I know that my treasure is heaven    </segment4>
