		<segment1>I hear you, so don't you say another word. Now here you are standing there crushing yourself. I'll near you, but my eyes see a different world. Here you are standing there breaking my heart, as you're crushing yourself. But lately you've been painting on the walls. With it like fire, you led. And you call it your mirror. And then you hate it, and then you spit on it </segment1>
		<segment2>But sorry, you're not a god. Now every flux you feel, well turn it into flames. So hold your breath so not to spill these ashes. Sorry, but you're not God </segment2>
		<segment3>I hear you, but I can't recognize even the sentence as truth. Who lit the black flame in your hearth?. I'm near you, but my words land far from your heart. You turn your back, and not know where to start. But lately you've been painting on the walls. With it like fire, you led. And it's a lie, and I hate it. But still you think it's you. Ready, keep on..    </segment3>
