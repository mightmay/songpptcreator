		<segment1>Well, look at yourself now. Swinging that sword around. You think there's something there. But you're just fighting air. You can't do this alone</segment1>
		<segment2>Hush, little boy, don't say a word. Don't you know Daddy's got this one?. Hey, little boy, bury your sword. Jesus already won this war</segment2>
		<segment3>Heroes will be heroes. The first to volunteer. But no one here is asking. And all the lines are clear. All who are weak, at ease</segment3>
		<segment4>You push yourself too hard. And your feet get so tired. Can't look back just yet. Or you might lose this fight. This is not your fight</segment4>
		<segment5>Hush, little boy, don't say a word. Don't you know Daddy's got this one?. Hey, little boy, bury your sword. Jesus already won this war    </segment5>
