		<segment1>You come to me with  scars on your wrist. You tell me this will be the last night feeling like this. I just came to say goodbye. I didn't want you to see me cry, I'm fine. But I know it's a lie</segment1>
		<segment2>This is the last night you'll spend alone. Look me in the eyes so I know you know. I'm everywhere you want me to be. The last night you'll spend alone. I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go. I'm everything you need me to be</segment2>
		<segment3>Your parents say everything is your fault. But they don't know you like I know you. They don't know you at all. I'm so sick of when they say. It's just a phase, you'll be o.k. you're fine. But I know it's a lie</segment3>
		<segment4>This is the last night you'll spend alone. Look me in the eyes so I know you know. I'm everywhere you want me to be. The last night you'll spend alone. I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go. I'm everything you need me to be. The last night away from me</segment4>
		<segment5>The night is so long when everything's wrong. If you give me your hand. I will help you hold on. Tonight, tonight</segment5>
		<segment6>This is the last night you'll spend alone. Look me in the eyes so I know you know. I'm everywhere you want me to be. The last night you'll spend alone. I'll wrap you in my arms and I won't let go. I'm everything you need me to be</segment6>
		<segment7>I won't let you say goodbye. And I'll be your reason why. The last night away from me. Away from me    </segment7>
