		<segment1>Let's run and not look back. When yesterdays come calling we'll leave its. falling prey worries and broken hopes. He believes in us so I'll try my best. to be there for you to help you along. Because I have confidence in you too. Now you know my hearts prayer. (that I see the world in you). And I believe he who began a good. work in you, will carry it through. The time is now</segment1>
		<segment2>Relief from understanding encouragement. and strength from truth. Hope is that which binds this together. You won't be weak (this is eternal). it will last forever. This friendship will last. Your bridge's burn is my heart's collapse. and we know a cord of three strands is not easily broken. As time unfolds we'll see uncertainties take flight. It's clear that tomorrow's just a. chance a chance that we cannot take. In time it will prevail it will stand the length of time. It will prevail    </segment2>
