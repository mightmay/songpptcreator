		<segment1>Submerged in endless (trailing off). I watch them fade by (sigh). Lifeless and blank-faced (paining on). I see.. The face I use to be. They want to feel this (straining on). They want to sense this (now). Drunk with existence (waking me). I'll show you something(someone) you can feel</segment1>
		<segment2>They search and strain and drink and stagger. They play on..but I'll never, ever look back</segment2>
		<segment3>Zombies staring, looking my way. Crying out for something.. They can't fill their stomachs with enough to satisfy. The hunger growing</segment3>
		<segment4>Needing something real</segment4>
		<segment5>Zombies staring, looking my way. crying out for something they can't feel. Play, on stray on, in these wicked days on. Play on and understand that in your drunken stupor you. are dying</segment5>
		<segment6>Zombies staring, looking my way. Reaching out for something, anything. Anything to keep them numbing. Keep them plunging far from knowing..     </segment6>
