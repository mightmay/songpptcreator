		<segment1>Back in the day when nothing really mattered to me, I only saw what my eyes, what they wanted to see. And everything around me seemed to never change. I'm looking for an easy way out, someone to blame. Why does it work this way still today?. You wanna take somebody down along the way?. But I won't let that one be me, 'cause I don't want the drama it brings. See today isn't &quot;back in the day&quot; anymore. I know a little more than I did before. So don't forget before you start bringing me down, what goes around always comes back around!</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus:</segment2>
		<segment3>YOU CAN'T BRING ME DOWN! Do you hear what I'm trying to say!. YOU CAN'T BRING ME DOWN! I'll never turn the other way!. YOU CAN'T BRING ME DOWN! What are you trying to say?. YOU CAN'T BRING ME DOWN! It's not like I'm run-in away!</segment3>
		<segment4>So you think you can see inside my mind?. You probably could if you just take a little time. I know exactly what your trying to say, He's sittin there saying Satan thinks I'm playin a game. So I can't comprehend in my mind, Just why we can't leave it all behind. So come on and stand beside the border line, 'cause tonight is the night we climb!</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>OH!</segment6>
		<segment7>Why can't we feel what it's Take's for us to be real?. Why can't we see what it's Take's for us to believe?. Why do we say all of these things that bring us down?</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>It's not like I'm runnin away!</segment9>
		<segment10>YOU CANT BRING ME DOWN    </segment10>
