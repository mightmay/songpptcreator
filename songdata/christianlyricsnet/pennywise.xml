		<segment1>Call me Pennywise and see. What it means to me. The things that set you free. Don't mean as much to me</segment1>
		<segment2>Call me anything you please. Things you may believe. For all your perfect plans. I'm not a lesser man</segment2>
		<segment3>So call it as you see. But you didn't rescue me. I turn around</segment3>
		<segment4>Can we stretch humility. Live our lives to mean something. Did we ever stop to think. We're squandering the lead</segment4>
		<segment5>So call it as you see. But you didn't rescue me. I turn around</segment5>
		<segment6>Leave me stray beyond me. Please be easy on me. Aren't we caught in the same lane. Please be</segment6>
		<segment7>Could you sacrifice ideals. offer me release. To exercise a dream. Invisible it seems</segment7>
		<segment8>Call me Pennywise and see. What it means to be. The things that set you free     </segment8>
