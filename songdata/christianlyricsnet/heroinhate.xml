		<segment1>before i kiss and tell i step away. another drug in my blood to prove that you don't understand. how could you see through your stained glass. and say that i'm hating my addiction. don't you put this one on me. i said don't you duck this one. you don't understand </segment1>
		<segment2>no sympathy. and i don't want to hear one excuse for what's been done to me. cause when i die by myself for my self it's my choice. cause this time i couldn't care less who you would impress. cause now this drug's in my vein i'm trading hatred for pain. and it's no lie to say that you don't understand </segment2>
		<segment3>you try to stand there and tell me i'm wrong. everyone you touch is dieing from lack of instinct or resolution. when thinking for themselves means to understand </segment3>
		<segment4>that's where i get my heroin hate </segment4>
		<segment5>    </segment5>
