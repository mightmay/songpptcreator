		<segment1>I HEAR YOU SAY. THAT YOU CANT GO ON. CAUSE YOU HAD IT ALL AND WATCHED IT FALL AWAY. YOU FEEL BETRAYED. CAUSE EVERYTHINGS GONE WRONG. CANT FIND THE STRENGTH TO HOPE FOR A BETTER DAY. WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE REASONS. BUT HIS PROMISE WILL NEVER CHANGE</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. HES GONNA TAKE YOUR PAIN. HES GONNA TAKE YOUR DOUBT. HES GONNA BRING IT ALL TOGETHER, BRING IT ALL TOGETHER. GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY. HES GONNA MAKE YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD. HES GONNA BRING IT ALL TOGETHER. BRING IT ALL TOGETHER FOR GOOD</segment2>
		<segment3>YOU SAY YOU LIVE YOU LIFE. DOING THE BEST YOU CAN. WONDERING IF THE STRUGGLE MEANS ANYTHING. IF YOU REALIZED THAT ITS IN HIS HANDS. YOULL FIND THE PEACE THAT SWEET SURRENDER BRINGS. WE MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE REASONS. BUT I KNOW HIS PROMISE WILL NEVER CHANGE</segment3>
		<segment4>HES GONNA TAKE YOUR PAIN. HES GONNA TAKE YOUR DOUBT. HES GONNA BRING IT ALL TOGETHER, BRING IT ALL TOGETHER. GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY. HES GONNA MAKE YOU LAUGH OUT LOUD. HES GONNA BRING IT ALL TOGETHER. BRING IT ALL TOGETHER FOR GOOD</segment4>
		<segment5>I KNOW THERE WILL COME A DAY OF HEALING. WE WILL SEE THE MASTER PLAN. WE WILL CELEBRATE HIS FAITHFULNESS. AND WELL SING (SING) AND WELL SHOUT (SHOUT). PRAISE HIS NAME</segment5>
		<segment6>Repeat chorus 2x    </segment6>
