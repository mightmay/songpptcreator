		<segment1>Yesterday morning when you told me. That you have never felt this lonely. I saw the sadness in your eyes. You told be how you feel disguised</segment1>
		<segment2>Confiding in me about the sleepless. Nights that you cannot seem to keep this. Hurting buried in your dreams. You're facing darkness twice as deep</segment2>
		<segment3>You're much sweeter than me by far. You're much stronger than me. You know you are</segment3>
		<segment4>Look up at the floral pattern cuurtains. In picking them out you were so certain. Now there's indecision in your eyes. You're finding comfort thinking twice</segment4>
		<segment5>You're much sweeter than me by far. You're much stronger than me. You know you are</segment5>
		<segment6>By leaning in your windowsill. You show me all I need to know. Wheather you see summer winter or fall. When I look at you I see them all</segment6>
		<segment7>Sit down at the table with your jewelry. Remembering each and every story</segment7>
		<segment8>You're much sweeter than me by far. You're much stronger than me. You're much sweeter than me by far. You're much stronger than me. You know you are    </segment8>
