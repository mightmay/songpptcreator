		<segment1>Through me the way to the city of dolent. Through me the way to eternal dole. Through me the way among people lost</segment1>
		<segment2>Justice incited my sublime Creator;. Created me divine Omnipotence;. The highest Wisdom, and the primal Love;</segment2>
		<segment3>Before me there were no created things, Only eterne, and I eternal last, All hope abandon, ye who enter in!</segment3>
		<segment4>These people have not any hope of death    </segment4>
