		<segment1>As I walk through the masses of snow at this frostbitten winter night. Sighing forest at the moon flow sends me a taste of natures might. Ahead mourns the eye of the snowstorm. Divine appearance of the winter wind. Snow, piles upon my soul, like Grace from above, Messenger of hope..</segment1>
		<segment2>My heart beats in sync with the nature. I wait for the coldest winter. I am the Snow Soul..</segment2>
		<segment3>I head my walk to the storm's eye more than complete to praise His name. Natures mourning set my pulse to rise as I follow steps of His angel's way. Ahead Kingdom of God in it's grandeur. Awaiting my soul to enter its halls. Snow, piles upon my soul, like Grace from above, Messenger of hope..</segment3>
		<segment4>My heart beats in sync with the nature. I wait for the coldest winter. I am the Snow Soul..</segment4>
		<segment5>Let it Snow.. Upon my soul.. I see my troubles come and go. Your given hope. Grace from above.. My belief keeps strengthening..    </segment5>
