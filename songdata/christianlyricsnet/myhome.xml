		<segment1>This place is many things, but I'd never.. call it home, It's just a building in a city, everywhere I go. This place is many things, but I can't call it home, Home is the place you are, and I just wanna let you know</segment1>
		<segment2>And I've done a few things, I wasn't proud of, Might of said a few things that hurt you, But you're still the only one, who fills me up, And every night spent alone, was worth it</segment2>
		<segment3>You are my home, you are my everything, when I feel so alone, You are my home, you are my shelter, ...when all my hope is gone</segment3>
		<segment4>And I've seen many things, but they don't look like home, There just the bright-lights from a city glowing all night long, And I've seen many faces, but they all look the same, Home is the place you are, and I just wanna let you know</segment4>
		<segment5>That I've done a few things, I wasn't proud of, Might of said a few things that hurt you, But you're still the only one, who fills me up, And all tears that we've shared, were worth it</segment5>
		<segment6>You are my home, you are my everything, when I feel so alone, You are my home, you are my shelter, ... when all my hope is gone. You are my home, you are my everything, when I feel so alone, You are my heart, you are the one, ..when it all comes undone. When it all comes undone, when it all comes undone</segment6>
		<segment7>You are my home, you are my everything, when I feel so alone,</segment7>
		<segment8>You are my home, you are my shelter, ... when all my hope is gone. You are my home, you are my everything, when I feel so alone, You are my heart, you are the one, ..when it all comes undone.     </segment8>
