		<segment1>Calloused and bruised. dazed and confused. My Spirit is left wanting something more. Than my selfish hopes. and my selfish dreams. I'm lying with my face down to the floor. I'm crying out for more (crying out for more)</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Give me Words to speak. Don't let my Spirit sleep. Cause I can't think of anything worth saying. But I know that I owe You my life. So give me Words to speak. Don't let my Spirit sleep </segment2>
		<segment3>Every night, every day. I find that I have nothing left to say. So I stand here in silence awaiting Your guidance. I'm wanting only Your voice to be heard. Let them be Your Words. Let them be Your words</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I just don't understand this life that I've been living. I just don't understand (x2). I just don't understand these lies I've been believing. I just don't understand (x2)</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus x2)</segment6>
		<segment7>I know that I owe you my life. Owe my life. Owe my life. (x2)    </segment7>
