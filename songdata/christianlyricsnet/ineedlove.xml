		<segment1>I left my conscience like a crying child. locked the door behind me put the pain on file. broken like a window i see my blindness now</segment1>
		<segment2>i need love. not some sentimental prison. i need god. not the political church. i need fire. to melt the frozen sea inside me. i need love</segment2>
		<segment3>driving into town tired and depressed. like a flare the streetlight bursts into an s.o.s. peace comes to my rescue and i don't know what it means. i need love    </segment3>
