		<segment1>We flow with bitter words that file sharp our teeth. And we bite off our own tongues. We trample any trace of your divinity's hope. And we sacrifice our young. With our eyes sewn shut now the light can't shine. Oh, we'll never wake from dead. And when you beg for us to open up and let you in. Then we'll cut you up instead </segment1>
		<segment2>[Pre-chorus]. You promised you'd give us your word. We never believed it was true. And we pretend that we never heard. Cus we still don't believe in you </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. I heard you calling, setting fire to my soul. Is this the voice we die for?. We die for life </segment3>
		<segment4>We built a wall to keep you out. Ignoring every word. And we saw your face behind our thoughts. Apathetic to what we'd heard </segment4>
		<segment5>[Pre-chorus] </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>Why does it falter? We built it all ourselves. Why does it hurt so bad, forsaking all this help?. Why are we choking on pills designed to heal?. We threw our hearts away cus we're too afraid to feel </segment7>
		<segment8>[Chorus] </segment8>
		<segment9>. .     </segment9>
