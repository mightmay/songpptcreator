		<segment1>You'll never find her story in a fairy tale. 'Cause she wasn't like, the other women at the well. Her life was full of pain, hurt, rejection. Her loneliness she didn't want to show. But Jesus saw the desert in her soul</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Drink from this water. Drink from this water. And you will never, you'll never thirst again. Drink from this water. Drink from this water. You will never, you'll never thirst again</segment2>
		<segment3>Ooooh. We all search for something. To fill us up inside. But it's only an illusion. You know a True Love's hard to find. But I'm here to tell you there's one place. Your thirst is quenched for ever more. You will never leave empty disappointed. You will find what you are looking for</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>And oh Jesus will meet you. At the place of every need. And only He can make the wounded whole. And make the blind man see</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus. Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Oooohh oooh    </segment7>
