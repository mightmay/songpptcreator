		<segment1>You put my back against the wall. Watching, waiting. You never thought I'd get this far. Beneath your skin. I watched you swim with all your lies. They pulled you under. And as you wait for my demise. I'm just getting stronger. I'm learning who you really are. And nothing can save you</segment1>
		<segment2>I will fight until the end. Get ready to collide. And I will watch you fall again. I'll bury you alive. You tried to bring me to my knees. You tried to take it all. Now I will stand and watch you crawl</segment2>
		<segment3>I'll put you back where you belong. Hopeless, fading. And I will rise while you become the monster you have fed. I'll let you drown in your despair. Now nothing can save you</segment3>
		<segment4>I will fight until the end. Get ready to collide. And I will watch you fall again. I'll bury you alive. You tried to bring me to my knees. You tried to take it all. Now I will stand and watch you crawl</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm still here. Now I'm gonna watch you beg</segment5>
		<segment6>I will fight until the end. Get ready to collide. And I will watch you fall again. I'll bury you alive. You tried to bring me to my knees. You tried to take it all. Now I will stand and watch you crawl    </segment6>
