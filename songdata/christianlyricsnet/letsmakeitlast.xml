		<segment1>Rain come down tonight. Except for the bump on my head I'm feeling alright. Dancing to our favorite tune. I pulled you in way too soon. Bang went the drums we went boom. Yeah </segment1>
		<segment2>Running through the yard. Splashing through puddles with you without regard. Do you think the neighbors will care. So what if they do they'll just stare. The kids will all say its not fair </segment2>
		<segment3>The way that we love. The way that we laugh. It's something worth seeing. So let's make it last. Let's make it last </segment3>
		<segment4>Come some sunny day. We'll call in sick to our jobs. What will we say. She's coming down with a flu. I think that I'm catching it too. This is what love makes you do </segment4>
		<segment5>The way that we love. The way that we laugh. It's something worth seeing. So let's make it last </segment5>
		<segment6>The way that we love. The way that we laugh. It's something worth seeing yea. So let's make it last. Live out each moment. They go by so fast. Let's make it last.     </segment6>
