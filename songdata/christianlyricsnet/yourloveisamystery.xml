		<segment1>God I messed it up again, I seem to do this all the time. Can you forgive me once again, or have I finally crossed the line?. They say Your grace is always with me and You're near me all the time. If that's the case I pray sincerely that Your love is truly blind</segment1>
		<segment2>The people on the outside watching me follow the crowd, find a way out. You know something on the inside's pushing me without a doubt. So I'm letting it go</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm never always right and it's plain to see. You love me Jesus, it's a mystery. You know my faults, You know my wrongs. And You still love me</segment3>
		<segment4>God I know that You exist, I've been told a thousand times. But my friends they all insist that the truth is just a lie. You see the life that they all live seems like a party all the time. The temptations I resist, because it's You I glorify</segment4>
		<segment5>The people on the outside watching me follow the crowd, find a way out. You know something on the inside's pushing me without a doubt. So I'm letting it go</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm never always right and it's plain to see. You love me Jesus, it's a mystery. You know my faults, You know my wrongs. And You still love me</segment6>
		<segment7>Let everything that I do or say reflect You in every way. Your way</segment7>
		<segment8>I'm never always right and it's plain to see. You love me Jesus, it's a mystery. You know my faults, You know my wrongs. And You still love me. [repeat]</segment8>
		<segment9>You love me Jesus, it's a mystery. You love me Jesus, it's a mystery    </segment9>
