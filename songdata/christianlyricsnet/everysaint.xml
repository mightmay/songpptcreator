		<segment1>He climbed down off that old john deere wiping sweat and I was wiping tears. He saw me coming across them cotton rows, he was 78 and I was 21. Feeling guilty for who Id become, and then the toughest man I knew pulled me close. He said son no matter what youve done, you gotta know</segment1>
		<segment2>It aint that you fall but that you get back up. Lifes more about faith, that it is about luck. Man makes a living by the work he does. But hell leave his mark cause of who he was. My boots have walked that road so son remember. Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future</segment2>
		<segment3>See I never knew the cane he raised he was a man of God a man of faith. He said, Let me tell you bout the way I used to be, I run from the law and Id run shy. Ive had some bar-room brawls and a shotgun bride, till one night in a tent revival I hit my knees</segment3>
		<segment4>It aint that you fall but that you get back up. Lifes more about faith, that it is about luck. Man makes a living by the work he does. But hell leave his mark cause of who he was. My boots have walked that road so son remember. Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future</segment4>
		<segment5>In the pages of the Good book you can read about liars, losers cheats and thieves. Who were changed so theres hope for you and me</segment5>
		<segment6>It aint that you fall but that you get back up. Lifes more about faith, that it is about luck. Man makes a living by the work he does. But hell leave his mark cause of who he was. My boots have walked that road so son remember. Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future. Every sinner has a future    </segment6>
