		<segment1>Everything was beautiful, and nothing hurt. </segment1>
		<segment2>&quot;As we melt let's make no noise. oh the profanation of our love. to tell the world our passing joys!. And we, besides, care less to miss. our eyes and lips and hands.&quot; </segment2>
		<segment3>(but honey, I'm not who you think I am!) </segment3>
		<segment4>&quot;And so you'll be to me. who must obliquely run. &quot;thy firmness makes my circle just, and makes me end where I begun&quot;. There's nothing wrong. as I'll be somewhere singing all along.&quot; </segment4>
		<segment5>(no! tell me, where have you gone, my love.).     </segment5>
