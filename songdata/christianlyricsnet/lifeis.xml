		<segment1>I just want to thank You. For finding me. And how could I forget You. And all You've done for me</segment1>
		<segment2>I gave You a stone. And You gave me a heart. Now I'm Yours</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. I gave You a tear. You gave me a song. And now I know what life is. I asked You for silver. And You gave me gold. And now I know what life is</segment3>
		<segment4>I just want to thank You. For trusting me. For standing right beside me. And believing in me</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't need fortune. I don't need fame. I just need You</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>And now I know what life is. And now I know what life is. And now I know what life is. And now I know what life is</segment7>
