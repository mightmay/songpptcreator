		<segment1>Mirror, Mirror on the wall; Have I got it?. 'Cause Mirror you've always told me who I am. I'm finding It's not easy to be perfect. So sorry, you won't define me. Sorry, you don't own me</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Who are you to tell me. that I'm less than what I should be?. Who are you?  Who are you?. I don't need to listen. to the list of things I should do. I won't try;  I won't try. You don't define me; You don't define me</segment2>
		<segment3>Mirror I am seeing a new reflection. I'm looking into the eyes of He who made me. To Him I have beauty beyond compare. I know He defines me</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus    </segment4>
