		<segment1>Just listen to the politican wishing his position like to say. And a constant in the constitution is that there can't be one solution. it'd be so far from the truth and we would hate it anway. Opinions are immunity to being told you're wrong. Paper, rock, and scissors they all have their pros and cons</segment1>
		<segment2>And all of us we will endure. Just like we always have. But you just can't be too sure. How long this will last</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause we control the chaos. In the back of our minds. Our problems seem so small. But the grow on us like gravity. But gravity still makes us fall    </segment3>
