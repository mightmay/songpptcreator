		<segment1>A thousand times I've failed. Still your mercy remains. And If I stumble again. I'm caught in our grace. Everlasting, Your light will shine. When all else fails. Neverending, your glory goes. Beyond all fame</segment1>
		<segment2>My heart and my soul. I give You control. Consume me from the inside out Lord. Let justice and praise. Become my embrace. To love You from the inside out</segment2>
		<segment3>Your will above all else. My purpose remains. The art of losing myself. In bringing You praise. Everlasting, Your light will shine. When all else fails. Never-ending, your glory goes. Beyond all fame</segment3>
		<segment4>My heart and my soul. I give You control. Consume me from the inside out Lord. Let justice and praise. Become my embrace. To love You from the inside out</segment4>
		<segment5>Everlasting, Your light will shine. When all else fails. Never-ending, Your glory goes. Beyond all fame. And the cry of my heart. Is to bring You praise. From the inside out. Lord my soul cries out    </segment5>
