		<segment1>And we're driving just as fast as we can. And we're racing to outrun the wind. It's just me and you and you and me. So wild and so young, bright-eyed and free </segment1>
		<segment2>And we're trying to get lost from here. As a small town romance draws ever near. And I swear we're in a movie. The highlight comes when you kiss me </segment2>
		<segment3>And the stereo sings our sing. And we don't hesitate sing </segment3>
		<segment4>And we're miles from the middle of nowhere. And neither of us seems to care. And that's why I love you so-o-o. So shut your mouth girl no one has to know. And times seems to drip like Dali. And neither of us has any place to be. So once and forever tell me all, tell me all of your dreams </segment4>
		<segment5>And the stereo sings our song. And we don't hesitate just sing. Is this what driving brings?. All the while we're singing off key </segment5>
		<segment6>Is this what driving brings?. All the while we're singing off key </segment6>
		<segment7>And we're driving just as fast as we can. And we're racing to outrun the wind. And the stereo sings our song. We don't hesitate just sing along. And the stereo sings our song. We don't hesitate just sing </segment7>
		<segment8>Is this what driving brings all the while we're singing off key? </segment8>
		<segment9>Is this what driving brings. All the while we're singing off key </segment9>
		<segment10>Is this what driving brings..     </segment10>
