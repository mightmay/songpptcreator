		<segment1>(Chorus). I waited. For the Lord on high. I waited. And He heard my cry</segment1>
		<segment2>He pulled me out of my despair. He taught me how to walk. From fear into security. From quicksand to the Rock</segment2>
		<segment3>Repeat Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>I sing to let the people know. That I have been restored. And they will kneel and understand. To return and trust in the Lord</segment4>
		<segment5>Repeat Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>And there's a new song. In my heart to sing. There's a new song. Praises for my King</segment6>
		<segment7>I waited     </segment7>
