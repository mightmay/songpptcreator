		<segment1>What child is this who laid to rest. On Mary's lap is sleeping. Whom angels greet with anthems sweet. While shepherds watch are keeping</segment1>
		<segment2>This, this is Christ the King. Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. Haste, haste to bring him laud. The babe, the son of Mary</segment2>
		<segment3>Why lies he in such mean estate. Where ox and ass are feeding. Good Christian fear, for sinners here. The silent Word is pleading</segment3>
		<segment4>So bring Him incense, gold, and myrrh. Come peasant king to own Him. The King of kings, salvation brings. Let loving hearts enthrone Him</segment4>
		<segment5>This, this is Christ the King. Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. Haste, haste to bring him laud. The babe, the son of Mary    </segment5>
