		<segment1>Some stories ring so true, a reality hitting deep. Some stories ring so true, putting life in perspective. She knew what she would encounter. Knowing what was to come. Knowing the past would catch up to her. Her heart was nearly hard by the lust inside. Alone and on borrowed time. Bound by guilt, she was bound by guilt. Alone and on borrowed time. This tormented soul, shunned by so many. Her eyes became dry from having no where else to run. She had only one thing left to hold onto, the only one who really cares. Someone who cares, who really cares. What can I measure to be when I ignore those who are oppressed and mistreated?. What can I measure to be, ignoring all that's meant for me?. I was once like her. The wrongs she had written would be erased and forgotten. His love was for sure and she knew this for sure    </segment1>
