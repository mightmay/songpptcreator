		<segment1>It seems like life would be better some other. Way some other day, life is what you make it. That's what some say just go away, I don't want to. Hear it I'm confused I'm not amused, right now. I'm incoherent I'm not on my own still I'm alone, </segment1>
		<segment2>I should have seen it coming I didn't want to see. I can see us breaking permanently!. I guess it's out of my hands that's exactly what I hate </segment2>
		<segment3>There's one thing left to turn to it's not a girl and it's not the world, When everyone has their own thing. He's into you and he loves you too. he's. What keeps me going when I'm afraid any my beds not made. Still I haven't forgotten that they're over there and. I'm right here. I might not always be here.    </segment3>
