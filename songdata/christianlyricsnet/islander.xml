		<segment1>I couldn't catch my breath, or calculate my death. Design of secret lace, and now I'm lost in space. I couldn't catch my breath</segment1>
		<segment2>I'll close the door, There's no one home. I'll catch my breath, and then half live. Things get stranger</segment2>
		<segment3>The creaking of the gate, the spies will hide and wait. You think I'm deaf to hear, but my camera's are everywhere. So now it comes to this?</segment3>
		<segment4>Blinking lights, monitor and survey the sides. Everywhere I go. Blinking lights, monitor and survey the skies. Things get stranger</segment4>
		<segment5>One down, 250 down. The forest floor, the smell of pine. Everywhere I go things get stranger    </segment5>
