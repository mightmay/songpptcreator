		<segment1>Under the floor between me and the door. There's a presence I cannot deny. It's under the car between me and the stars. I see glory filling up the sky </segment1>
		<segment2>And I'm certain that He hears me. He listens even as I sing my song. I'm emphatic that He's near me. And I can see His touch in everything here </segment2>
		<segment3>Deep is the soul, is the space I control. Is the one thing I can call as mine. Deeper the cold when He's far from my soul. I surrender all of me inside </segment3>
		<segment4>And I'm certain that He hears me. He listens even as I sing my song. I'm emphatic that He's near me. I can see His touch in everything here. In everything here </segment4>
		<segment5>And I'm certain that He hears me. He listens even as I sing my song. I'm emphatic that He's near me. And I can see His touch in everything here. In everything here. In everything here    </segment5>
