		<segment1>Well, its my turn now. Yes, its my turn now. My turn to give my life away</segment1>
		<segment2>I close the book and I shake my head. Sometimes I cant believe the things Ive read. I dont deserve what He did for me. He gave His love and His life away. And now Hes asking me to do the same. So Im gonna give Him all I am. And all I ever hope to be</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, its my turn now. Yes, its my turn now. My turn to give my life away</segment3>
		<segment4>I open up the book and look again. I read the stories of the faithful men. Who gave up all they had to follow Him. He used the strong and He used the weak. He even gave the timid words to speak. He called whoever listened then. And now His call goes out again</segment4>
		<segment5>Well, its my turn now. Yes, its my turn now. My turn to give my life away</segment5>
		<segment6>My turn to say I love Him. My turn to let Him know. My life is His so where He leads me thats where I will go</segment6>
		<segment7>Well, its my turn now. Yes, its my turn now. My turn to give my life away </segment7>
