		<segment1>Why are you striving these days. Why are you trying to earn grace. Why are you crying. Let me lift up your face. Just don't turn away</segment1>
		<segment2>Why are you looking for love. Why are you still searching as if I'm not enough. To where will you go child. Tell me where will you run. To where will you run</segment2>
		<segment3>And I'll be by your side. Wherever you fall. In the dead of night. Whenever you call. And please don't fight. These hands that are holding you. My hands are holding you</segment3>
		<segment4>Look at these hands and my side. They swallowed the grave on that night. When I drank the world's sin. So I could carry you in. And give you life. I want to give you life</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus 2x)</segment5>
		<segment6>Cause I, I love you. I want you to know. That I, I love you. I'll never let you go</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus 2x)    </segment7>
