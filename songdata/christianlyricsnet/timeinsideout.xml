		<segment1>vs1. She makes a masterpiece, shoestring and paper. She tucks it safe in my bag as I go. ItÂ’s like a piece of her, I take it with me. She opens my heart to see beauty she makes with her hands</segment1>
		<segment2>Down by the water, her mind full of wonder. Creatures in our hearts are so full of life. Blurring the lines between student and teacher. She captures my heart like she captures the bird in her hands</segment2>
		<segment3>ch. Turning time inside out. Ever after, ticking like a watch on my wrist. Flashbulbs forgetting while eternity breaks in. Turning time inside out</segment3>
		<segment4>vs2. Little boy prince with his crown and his castle. His coy invitation, his eyes like my own. Imagination untamed and unfettered. He wins my heart with a sword and a kiss to my hand</segment4>
		<segment5>ch</segment5>
		<segment6>bridge. And the youngest with her fire. Dimple and blues. Sings her own tune. Little souls are..</segment6>
		<segment7>ch    </segment7>
