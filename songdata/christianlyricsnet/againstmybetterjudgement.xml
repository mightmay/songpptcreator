		<segment1>With starving appetites for arguments. you remind me of a secret. I was never supposed to tell. </segment1>
		<segment2>The time is over, the verdicts in: Everybody's right, everybody wins. The time is over, the verdicts in: Everybody's right, everybody wins </segment2>
		<segment3>Didn't you know you were a saint, what a shameful fall from grace. But I'll catch you, I'll catch you. Everybody's waiting for that something they can hold onto. while tripping over our own words to self-dug graves for an excuse to fall. Becuase every failure's just as sweet as the last </segment3>
		<segment4>The time is over, the verdicts in: Everybody's right, everybody wins. The tims is over, the verdicts in: Everybody's right, everybody wins </segment4>
		<segment5>Didn't you know you were a saint, what a shameful fall from grace. But I'll catch you, I'll catch you. Everybody's waiting for that something they can hold onto. while tripping over our own words to self-dug graves for an excuse to fall. Becuase every failure's just as sweet as the last </segment5>
		<segment6>As a dream comes. when there are many cares. so the speech of a fool. when there are many words. the sun it misses summer in winter. Didn't you know we wear. the same pretentious name. lets trade for awhile. i'm so curious </segment6>
		<segment7>Everybody's waiting for that something they can hold onto. while tripping over our own words to self-dug graves for an excuse to fall. Becuase every failure's just as sweet as the last.     </segment7>
