		<segment1>(chorus). Some people gotta learn the hardway. I guess I'm the kinda guy. That has to find out for myself. I had to learn the hardway, Father. I'm on my knees and I'm crying for help</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I've been high and I've been low. I've been some places that you will not go. I never thought there would come the day. When I wished I never would've lived this way. But I've been searching for a long, long time. I thought the devil was a friend of mine. I turned my back on everything that was true. And wasted years that belong to you</segment2>
		<segment3>(repeat chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>It took so long for me to see. That I'm a victim of nature and me. Left to myself I realize. I am the maker of my own demise</segment4>
		<segment5>But you accept me every time and again. And never mention just how selfish I've been. Why must it always take me so long to see. That I have fallen but you will forgive me?</segment5>
		<segment6>(repeat chorus 2x)</segment6>
		<segment7>The warning signs are like flares in the night. Still I proceed my greed is in spite of the fire. I know that's bound to burn. Why is it that I always gotta learn.. The hardway, the hardway, I had to learn the hardway. The hardway, the hardway, I had to learn the hardway     </segment7>
