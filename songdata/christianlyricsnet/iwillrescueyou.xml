		<segment1>When your days are dark. And your nights are cold. When you've just about. Lost all your faith. When your will is gone. And your heart is torn. 'Cause nothing is going your way. When the world has. Got you trapped. And you can't find that open door. If you're ever in a battle. And you just can't fight no more</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I will rescue you. I will rescue you. I will shelter you from the rain. I will dry your tears. Cast away your fears. And bring you to brighter days. Whenever you're lost and confused. Like a fairy tale come true. I will rescue you</segment2>
		<segment3>If you ever feel. That you can't go on. When your life just. Becomes too hard. And the dreams you thought. Were within your reach. Suddenly seem so far. When the world is on your case. And you don't have. A place to run. If the storm keeps getting stronger. And you cannot see the sun</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>And it don't matter where you are. I'll be by your side. I'll be the rock that you can lean on. I'll be your guide</segment5>
		<segment6>(Chorus).     </segment6>
