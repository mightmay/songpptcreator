		<segment1>The walls are closing in on me. I'm getting dizzy and it's hard to see. My lungs are heavy and it hurts to breath. Can't lift my head, stare at me feet. It's all getting clear</segment1>
		<segment2>You tell me I don't want to hear. I know you see my eyes the fear. I clench my teeth and shut my ears. I've tried it all and I'm sick of fighting. The words of truth made clear in writing. Oh, Lord deliver me!</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to be free so I may mount up on wings. For once I don't feel so dead. I can breath again and lift my head. No longer bound to a life once led. True to everything he said. I want to fly all around. And not look back or touch the ground. I want to fly up so high. And look deep into Your eyes. Gravity means nothing to me. Just another lock broke free. Against my face the wind will blow. To the world Your glory shows. I'm tired of Satan's attacks. Get the devil off my back. Down the tunnel I see light. Nevermore will I have to fight!</segment3>
		<segment4>Pick it up (3X). Hey (4X)</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, Lord deliver me. I want to be se free. I want to fly so high. Look deep into Your eyes (4X)    </segment5>
