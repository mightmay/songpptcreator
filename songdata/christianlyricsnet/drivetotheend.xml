		<segment1>Our families were there. And everyone we knew. Were waiting there just to see you. I waited on the side. I could not believe. That we had made it this far. Will you ever know how much. I love you. I don't think it's possible. Will you ever know how much. You mean to me. I don't think you'll ever see. I thought I would not sound. But it wasn't me. I thought I'd know just what to do. When I fully saw your face. I knew it was to be. Together forever with me. We will be. [Chorus].     </segment1>
