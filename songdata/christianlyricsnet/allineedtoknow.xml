		<segment1>[Verse 1:].  You could read a million pages, know the words and all the phrases.  You could try to turn a lie into the truth.  You can live to be a hundred, memorizin' every number.  You could even put a man on the moon.  And the science of the heart is sometimes lost on me.  But I'm following this feeling!</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:].  I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride!.  And I don't know how many wrongs make a right.  I don't know the reason.  Sometimes it just feels so good to cry!.  And I don't know which way the wind will blow.  But you're here with me.  And that's all I need to know!</segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse 2:].  There's a moment in the morning, when I feel the most alone.  But then I hear your voice, whispering my name.  It's like a wave of understanding and I never could have planned it.  When the questions, and doubts all fade away.</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5> That's all I need to know</segment5>
		<segment6>[Bridge:].  I figured it out, you turned me around at the speed of light.  All that I ever needed to know was in your eyes.</segment6>
		<segment7>[Ending/Chorus:].  I don't know why, it's so hard to swallow our pride.  And I never count all the stars in the sky.  I don't know the reason.  Sometimes it just feels so good to cry!.  And I don't know which way the wind will blow.  But you're here with me.  And that's all I need to know!</segment7>
		<segment8> That's all I need to know!.  That's all I need to know.  All I need to know!    </segment8>
