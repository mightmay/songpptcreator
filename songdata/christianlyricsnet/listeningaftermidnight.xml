		<segment1>Listenin after midnight, watchin till I yawn. Learnin till Im snoring, then Im gone, Im gone. I took a seat upon the window ledge (boldly, slowly). Im three floors up and on the edge (holy moly). I come to church and they preach all night. Thats why I may be droopy-eyed. CHORUS. That preacher Paul is lecturing still (code red, code red). He needs to take a sleeping pill (go to bed, go to bed). While Pauls a-preaching, Im half awake. Its morning, Reverend, take a break!. CHORUS. Im leanin forward, Im fallin floorward. My bodys tumblin  Oh, I died in the fall!. The resurrections starting now (for me, for me). Im guessin God gave Paul the power (glory, glory). He saved my life and then dove in. The boy starts teaching us again. Lecturin after midnight, talkin till the dawn. Leavin in the morning, then hes gone, all gone. Its in Acts 20, I am Eutychus. Love to tell the story, and its cause I was. Livin after midnight, God can do it all. Life is never boring when theres God     </segment1>
