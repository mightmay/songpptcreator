		<segment1>What is it you want My child?. What is it your heart desires?. Ive given you so many things. Things you thought would satisfy. But, youre not happy, youre not happy..</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, Im drowning in my sin. Whats a lonely heart to do?. Strip away the substitutes. Til	I	desire	only You..Til. I desire only You.</segment2>
		<segment3>Only You.. Only You	can	satisfy. Only You.. Only You	can	fill	my	life. Lord, take all and everything. Til	I	desire only You.. Til	I	desire only you    </segment3>
