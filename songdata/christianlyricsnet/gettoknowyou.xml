		<segment1>I heard so much of you I wrote a book. Thick with thoughts of you that I heard were true. The critics read my work and they reviewed. He wrote of things he'd heard but never really knew</segment1>
		<segment2>Id say it's time that I get to know you. More then just what Ive been told. Id say it's time that I get to know you. I want to know from my soul </segment2>
		<segment3>I was so close but I was still without. How could I be so right and still be so wrong. Youre like a tune Ive only heard about. Let me hear that song - hear it loud and strong    </segment3>
