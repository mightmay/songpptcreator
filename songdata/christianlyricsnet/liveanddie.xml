		<segment1>I get up Friday and I'm late for school, only 13 but I got mad pull, It's cool who needs a job. when I can steal and rob making all that money, but my mom don't think its funny. CAll up the homies, cause today's the day they gonna make a man of me, a gangsta, a O.G. They say I'm young, but I got much heart. Feel like a kid inside, I know how to play the part, gotta get jumped in, but man, it ain't no thing, 5 minutes of pain for the love of a gang. Might not be right but it's all I know. Messed up and joined a gang, gave away my soul. NOTHING MATTERS TO ME!. EXCEPT RIGHT NOW!. MAKE IT THROUGH TO TOMMOROW SOMEDAY, SOMEHOW!. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, BUT IT MAKES SENSE TO ME!. I WON'T STOP UNTIL I REST IN PEACE! 2x. I got my first 9-LIM, so brothers beware looking to get into some trouble, all it takes is a stare without a care, I see some fools that ain't from my set. Represent what I claim, then take my respect. Scared as heck, but I'm down how you figure you might be big, but my trigga is bigga. Bust five shots as I fall to the floor. with a single second I become hardcore, I knew this morning, it would be one of those days, g, I missed them suckas again. , but hit a lady and her baby. LIVE BY THE SWORD DIE BY THE SWORD!. INNOCENT LIFE, WHAT ARE THEY DYING FOR?!. LIVE BY THE GAT, DIE BY THE GUN!. WHO SUFFERS WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE?!    </segment1>
