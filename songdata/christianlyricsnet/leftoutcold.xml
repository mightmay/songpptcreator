		<segment1>What happened now?. Excuse of why we can't move away. Taken from the box. Skimmed over the top. Trust is of the past. Friendships never last. Nobody wins in a race against defeat. You conquered our beliefs with words of deceit. Harbored animosity engulfing our desires to forgive.</segment1>
		<segment2>Now fear swept away. I've nothing left to say. I chose heaven over death. Simple as breath. My God has taken charge. My past has left me scarred. Left out cold.</segment2>
		<segment3>There was a place we all knew where we could get along. No one stabbed another brother. We could rely on eachother. The virtues we all shared no other time compares. How could we have let you get away?. Harbored animosity, engulfing our desires to forgive.</segment3>
		<segment4>Now fear swept away. I've nothing left to say. I chose heaven over death. Simple as breath. My God has taken charge. My past has left me scarred. Left out cold.    </segment4>
