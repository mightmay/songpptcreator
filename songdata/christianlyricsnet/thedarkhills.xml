		<segment1>Verse 1: Sittin in the dark shakin in a cold wind dyin to get well keep trying but Im broken. A kiss on my lips that use to thrill me, if I go another day it's gonna kill me. Slipped into a dream woke up in a nightmare scars on my skin don't know how they got there. How heavy was the crown of thorns? I wonder if Im to far gone?</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: They say Jesus walked the dark hills He broke bread with beggars and thieves. If I cry out in this darkness, if I fall down on my knees. If He walks the dark hills, will He come for me? Will He come save me?</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2: Searching for the truth through stained glass windows covered up in shame things that only I know. Strike a match and light another candle, raise my hands a sing a pretty song. If anybody knew this ugliness inside me would they throw a stone would the crucify me?. How heavy was the crown of thorns? I wonder if Im to far gone?</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: How heavy was the crown of thorns? I wonder if I'm to far gone?</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus 3: They say Jesus walks the dark hills He breaks bread with beggars and thieves. When I cry out in this darkness, When I fall down on my knees. When He walks the dark hills, I know He'll come for me. I know He'll come save me     </segment6>
