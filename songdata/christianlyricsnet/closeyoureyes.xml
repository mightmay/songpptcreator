		<segment1>It was simple until I started to question. the answers i started testing. to find the truth. between the lines. to decipher all these signs</segment1>
		<segment2>i thought, theres gotta be something more to. this gravity that pulls us toward you. i found the proof i thought i needed. i looked in the mirror. yet i was breathing</segment2>
		<segment3>just close your eyes. wake your mind. realize. were connected</segment3>
		<segment4>it took a while to see. i thought the only that one they follow is me. but your telescope eyes helped me to see. the sparkling  hidden truth buried underneath</segment4>
		<segment5>youre beautiful by design. youre intricate, yes youre divine. the deepest part of the human heart. is where true love blows. in from the windows</segment5>
		<segment6>close your eyes. wake your mind. realize. were connected</segment6>
		<segment7>if we dont have love what do we have. if we close our eyes then can we last?. but maybe if we hold our breath this thing will pass. you know that i never look back. never look back. never look back. never look back. never look back. never look back</segment7>
		<segment8>close your eyes. wake your mind. realize. were connected</segment8>
		<segment9>we are connected. we are connected. were connected    </segment9>
