		<segment1>I'm remembering the words inside my head. I heard them yesterday. A whisper telling me that life waits up ahead. Beyond the day to day. Through this world will hand me my fair share of pain. Leave me broken and bruised. I know there's a Father and His Son who know my name. And They will see me through. Oh yeah, I know</segment1>
		<segment2>I believe He paid the price. A sacrifice so we could be together. Forever. And I know when I see Jesus' face. All my tears will be erased forever. Forever</segment2>
		<segment3>Hidden in my heart. The day He called me friend. The day He set me free. I found Him one summer day. Or better said, Jesus, You found me. I gave You my loneliness and broken heart. You gave to me Your love, Your love</segment3>
		<segment4>I believe He paid the price. A sacrifice so we could be together. Forever. And I know when I see Jesus' face. All my tears will be erased forever. Forever</segment4>
		<segment5>I've come to know. I've come to know love. I've come to know the truth. I've come to know. I've come to know love</segment5>
		<segment6>I believe he paid the price. A sacrifice so we could be together. Forever. And i do believe I'll see the face. Of Jesus and we'll both embrace together. Forever    </segment6>
