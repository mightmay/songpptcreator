		<segment1>Spirit of heaven, flood over me. Forming Christ in all that I do. Turn every sinful desire in me. Into holy passion for You</segment1>
		<segment2>O Spirit of God, come down. Let mercy and grace abound. My passionate prayer shall be. Christ in me</segment2>
		<segment3>Spirit of beauty and holiness. Come refine with fire from above. Till I am cast in Your righteousness. And I love the things that You love</segment3>
		<segment4>O Spirit of God, come down. Let mercy and grace abound. My passionate prayer shall be. Christ in me</segment4>
		<segment5>Breathe Your forgiveness when darkness falls. And my heart is heavy with sin. Fill me with faith for the higher cause. Of the ceaseless praise of the King</segment5>
		<segment6>O Spirit of God, come down. Let mercy and grace abound. My passionate prayer shall be. Christ in me    </segment6>
