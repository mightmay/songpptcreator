		<segment1>Pillar - Holding On Lyrics</segment1>
		<segment2/>
		<segment3>. I'm gonna keep on holding on</segment3>
		<segment4>Times are changing, rearranging. All the raging over little things has got me all confused. And I don't why, but it seems I caught the big lie. And I'm letting go and reaching out for truth. So, I can't stop now, 'til I find out what it's all about, and. somehow. Grab a hold, so no one can take it away</segment4>
		<segment5>I'll be, I'll be holding on. I see right where I belong. I know everything that's going on around me</segment5>
		<segment6>Your frustrations, complications, time is wasting. You better figure out whether you're wasting time. It all comes down to I can't make you feel what I do. But I can feel for you, so, what do you got to lose?</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm gonna keep on holding on, while all of this is going on. I should've seen this all along, but now, I see right where I. went wrong. That doesn't mean I can't be strong. So, now, I've got to carry on. It's hard to see that I was gone. I'll stay right here where I belong.     </segment7>
