		<segment1>Trapped in simple conversation. Hard getting past good reason. Say how are you oh Im doin just fine. Theyve said all that they can say. Then they turn and walk away. And the wounded hearts must wait another day</segment1>
		<segment2>Who cares when theyre crying. Who cares when theyre all alone. And no one knows how much they long. To find someone. Who cares that theyre dying. Who cares that the road is long. And you could be the one to lead them. To the One who cares</segment2>
		<segment3>Captured by the rush of living. So hard to hear our brothers quiet cries. But freedom comes when we are willing. To open up our hearts and realize. Theyve said all that they can say. We cant turn and walk away. Cause the wounded hearts might not wait another day</segment3>
		<segment4>Who cares when theyre crying. Who cares when theyre all alone. And no one knows how much they long. To find someone. Who cares that theyre dying. Who cares that the road is long. And you could be the one to lead them. To the One who cares</segment4>
		<segment5>The Father gave His Son. To show the world how much He cares. And now its up to us to let them know. He cares.     </segment5>
