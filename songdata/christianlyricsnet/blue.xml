		<segment1>Burning bridges. Burning bridges. Shut myself off from the world. Burning bridges. Burning bridges. Shut myself off from life </segment1>
		<segment2>As the ashes fall. As the ashes fall. Through the fire. Through the flame. [X2] </segment2>
		<segment3>Life purified again </segment3>
		<segment4>I won't look back. To the chains that bound me. [X2] </segment4>
		<segment5>I will lay to rest my ghosts. And cover my footsteps. I will stand up straight and walk away. Leaving them far behind </segment5>
		<segment6>Won't look back. Chains that bound me.     </segment6>
