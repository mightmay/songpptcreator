		<segment1>Pity puppet with a head full o' bees. Purging courage on your hands and your knees. Richard in your ear kinda gives me the creeps. Tell you how ta walk, how ta talk, how ta sleep.</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't stop. Don't go. Don't go. Don't stay. Go stop. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go!. (Shake your sould!). Make your own way!</segment2>
		<segment3>Guess you're dressed as Dominique Francon. I'm thinking Petey Keating-. But you couldn't have known. Be a good dog, Maybe they'll toss you a bone. Don't see the catch until it's stuck in your throat!    </segment3>
