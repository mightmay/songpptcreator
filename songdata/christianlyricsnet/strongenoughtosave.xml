		<segment1>[Verse 1:]. You fought. but you were just too weak. so you lost. all the things you try to keep. now you're on your knees, you're on your knees </segment1>
		<segment2>But wait, everything can change, in a moments time you don't have to be afraid, cause fear is just a lie. open up your eyes </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. And he'll break. open the skies to save. those who cry out his name. the one the wind and waves obey. is strong enough to save you</segment3>
		<segment4>[Verse 2:]. Look now is not too late. lift up your head. let the rain fall on your face. you're not far from grace, your not too far from grace </segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus:]. And he'll break. open the skies to save. those who cry out his name. the one the wind and waves obey. is strong enough to save you. [Repeat]</segment5>
		<segment6>[Bridge:]. I know the weight of this world can take you down like gravity. I know the current of yourself can take you out, out to sea. but hold on, hold on </segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus:]. And he'll break. open the skies to save. those who cry out his name. the one the wind and waves obey. is strong enough to save you    </segment7>
