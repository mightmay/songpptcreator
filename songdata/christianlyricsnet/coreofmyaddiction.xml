		<segment1>I'm aching, transparent. Your eyes see right through me. I'm dependent and shaking. I'm falling to my knees</segment1>
		<segment2>And I can't contain this. You're the only one I need. I'm hooked and I cannot hide it. Your love's controlling me</segment2>
		<segment3>You're the core of my addiction. I want to live, want to lose myself in You. You're the heart of my obsession. I want to live, but I would die for You. I'm addicted</segment3>
		<segment4>Impulsive, enraptured. This yearning's captured me. I'm determined, I'm not pretending. You are my destiny</segment4>
		<segment5>I can feel the freedom. You're the only one I need. I'm alive and finally breathing. You're my recovery</segment5>
		<segment6>God, I've waited for this day. I'll never run away. And You won't have to chase me</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm addicted. I'm addicted to You    </segment7>
