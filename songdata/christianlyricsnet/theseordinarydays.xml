		<segment1>Not much for conversation, I still find need to pray. Sometimes I get tired of walking through these ordinary days. If nothing else I get to see you even if we never speak. The harm of words is sometimes we don't quite know what they really mean. </segment1>
		<segment2>I don't know where, I don't know how. I don't know why, but your love can make these things better. </segment2>
		<segment3>Let me lay down in this field and stare up at the sky. I hope the days and clouds turn into something as they pass us by. And maybe you could settle for a skyline faded blue. I hope that you might settle for this love I have for you. </segment3>
		<segment4>I don't know where, I don't know how. I don't know why, but your love can make these things better. </segment4>
		<segment5>I don't know where, I don't know how. I don't know why, but your love can make these things better. </segment5>
		<segment6>I don't know where, I don't know how. I don't know why, but your love can make these things better. </segment6>
		<segment7>Your love can make these things better. Your love can make these things better. Your love can make these things better.     </segment7>
