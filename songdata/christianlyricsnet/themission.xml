		<segment1>Tear down the walls of this place burn it all down to the ground a mission bigger than all of us but that won't shake our confidence don't let it break your will don't let it break your back never stray from the path stay focused keep the faith times change and most things get worse but that's just a sign of the times we have to join together strength through our common bond unleash this strength through faith our victory keep the faith stay focused.    </segment1>
