		<segment1>You know I can't explain this feeling. It's almost like I'm dreaming this reality. You know You give me such a freedom. I finally found the way home. I'm right where I belong. Ever since the day I prayed. You into my heart I placed. Every bit of me into Your hands. Lord, I'm here to stay</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: With all of my heart. I'm gonna love You. With all of my soul. I'll put all my trust in You. With all of my strength. I'm standing beside You. With all of my everything. I will worship You, my king. With all of my heart. With all of my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, Lord, I can't define You. Who am I to know You the way I do?. From now until forever. I promise I will never, never let You go. Lord, I want to be the one. After all is said and done. From now til eternity. I'm yours faithfully</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Every night when I close my eyes. I am amazed at how You've blessed my life in every way. I'm mystified by Your great love. Nothing compares to having You near. Every day I'll love You more than the day before</segment5>
		<segment6>With all of my heart. I'm gonna love You. With all of my soul. I'll put all my trust in You. With all of my strength. I'm standing beside You. With all of my everything. I will worship You, my king</segment6>
		<segment7>With all of my heart. I'm gonna love You. With all of my soul. I'll put all my trust in You. With all of my strength. I'm standing beside You. With all of my everything. I will worship You, my king</segment7>
		<segment8>With all of my heart. I'm gonna love You. With all of my soul. I'll put all my trust in You. With all of my strength. I'm standing beside You. With all of my everything. I will worship You, my king    </segment8>
