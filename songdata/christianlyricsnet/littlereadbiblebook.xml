		<segment1>Who's that I see not doin any good?. Why it's a little-read Bible book!. Hey there, little-read Bible book, you sure have been forsook. You're never read, so big bad wolves can roam. Literally!. Little-read Bible book, I don't think many people look. So we're walkin' in and making ourselves at home. Owwr! What big lies we have!. We come as spies disguised as lambs. But if they'd read just an open page. I think they all could spot the wolves far away. What truth Scripture has! Its sure to warn if someones bad. So before they understand Gods grace. I think I ought to lock you up in a safe. I'm gonna keep my sheep suit on. And Ill assure them nothing's wrong. And you can get dusty and they all can leave you alone. Owwr! Little-read Bible book, I'd like to quote you, yes I would. But first I'll change me a thing or two on my own. Owwr! What if these parts I add. A word or two, nothing big. Little-read Bible book  even bad news can seem good. I'll try a little cyanide, just enough to slide on by. Maybe they'll swallow things I say. Before they get to that odd taste. Little-read Bible book, I'm sure their goose is cooked. They never read in the big black book at all. Owwr! That's too bad  Baaad    </segment1>
