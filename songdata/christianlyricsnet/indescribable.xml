		<segment1>From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea. Creation's revealing Your majesty. From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring. Every creature unique in the song that it sings. All exclaiming</segment1>
		<segment2>Indescribable, uncontainable. You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name. You are amazing God. All powerful, untamable. Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim. You are amazing God</segment2>
		<segment3>Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go. Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow. Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light. Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night. None can fathom</segment3>
		<segment4>Indescribable, uncontainable. You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name. You are amazing God. All powerful, untamable. Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim. You are amazing God</segment4>
		<segment5>Indescribable, uncontainable. You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name. You are amazing God. Incomparable, unchangeable. You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same. You are amazing God    </segment5>
