		<segment1>I dont got much to say but that I love you anyway. We all have those times in our lives when we really wanna believe the lies. It really hurt me when you thought I wasnt perfect. but Im sorry I cant give you everything. Just because your lifes not like mine doesnt mean I have more than you, more than you. So I love you anyway, anyway. I love you anyway. I love you anyway. I will remember all the times we shared together. and I will remember all the tears that fell from my eyes. Seventy minutes on the phone is a long time. but God has a reason for you to be in my life. There will be times I remember the things that you did to me. but I will move on and leave that for my history    </segment1>
