		<segment1>Once again here we are another melody Ill sing. And you will laugh and you will smile. But when were done we all will leave. But there is something more I wasnt to give. More than just a melody, I guess</segment1>
		<segment2>Once again, here we are, this little trip seems so far. Well spin these tires and beat the road. A few more songs, A few more shows</segment2>
		<segment3>Once again here we are, He has carried us this far. When I get tired, I wont quit. Until Ive given all Ive got to give</segment3>
		<segment4>Once again here we are. Here we are once again     </segment4>
