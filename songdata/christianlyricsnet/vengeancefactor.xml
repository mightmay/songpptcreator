		<segment1>This is worth it's weight in words. to give in now would be absurd. So keep your retracted retractions to yourself. </segment1>
		<segment2>This plays upon my sympathies, I shouldn't have come. I know I should leave, but they said, but they said. I should see this for myself. </segment2>
		<segment3>And now these sighs are severing. And I was saving everything, can't believe, I believed, I believed that this might help. </segment3>
		<segment4>Making amends, seems so far out of hand. still holding strong to where we stand. must of lost all sight of how we ever felt. </segment4>
		<segment5>gettin even, gettin even, gettin ready to fight. gettin smug, gettin ugly, and lost all sense of pride, an I'm forgetting, I'm forgetting. why I wanted to cry, and I'm still waiting on a day no hearts would die.     </segment5>
