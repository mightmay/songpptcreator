		<segment1>This is a time for us to demonstrate our appreciation. Amazing grace and sweet salvation. I can't pay you back, my Lord, so I won't even try. I will give you I and i. You know when I'm standin' up and when I'm falling down. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. You know if I'm hungry, tired, or feeling kind of low. Why you care, I just don't know.</segment1>
		<segment2>I cast all my life and all my cares. And everything on you. He cares for you like no one else</segment2>
		<segment3>This is a time for us to celebrate our emancipation. Voices ring across the nations. There will never be another there has never been. Helpess and you took us in. Because of Jesus Christ, we know salvation is secure. I don't worry anymore. Who can give you council, Lord? And who can search your mind? You're before me and behind.</segment3>
		<segment4>I cast all my life and all my cares. And everything on you. He cares for you like no one else</segment4>
		<segment5>Every time I shed a tear it matters, it matters, Every time I'm cold with fear it matters, it matters. When I got a broken heart it matters, it matters. Every time I fall apart it matters, it matters. When I think I'm all alone. On the road or when at home. Every time I have to sneeze. Every single breath I breathe. When I'm in a dentist's chair it matters, it matters. Anywhere and every where it matters, it matters</segment5>
		<segment6>He cares for you like no one else.     </segment6>
