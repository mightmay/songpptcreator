		<segment1>None of us knows and that makes it a mystery. If life is a comedy, then why all the tragedy. Three-and-a-half pounds of brain try to figure out. What this world is all about. And is there an eternity, is there an eternity?. God if You're there I wish You'd show me. And God if You care then I need You to know me. I hope You don't mind me askin' the questions. But I figure You're big enough. I figure You're big enough. Lying on pillows we're haunted and half-awake. Does anyone hear us pray. 'If I die before I wake'. Then the morning comes and the mirror's the other place. Where we wrestle face to face with the image of Deity. The image of Deity. God if You're there I wish You'd show me. And God if You care then I need You to know me. I hope You don't mind me askin' the questions. But I figure You're big enough. I figure You're big enough. When I imagine the size of the universe. And I wonder what's out past the edges. Then I discover inside me a space as big. And believe that I'm meant to be. Filled up with more than just questions. So, God if You're there I wish You'd show me. And God if You care then I need You to know me. I hope You don't mind me askin' the questions. But I figure You're big enough. I figure You're big enough. 'Cause I am not big enough     </segment1>
