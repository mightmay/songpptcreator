		<segment1>How can it be that God is love?. When blood rolls down upon our land. And fathers lose their only son. Where is the hope?. Oh God we pray for white ribbon day</segment1>
		<segment2>How can it be that you could love?. When blood ran down that wooden cross. Your father gave his only son. You came for peace. You came to die for white ribbon day</segment2>
		<segment3>And we pray for peace. To flood our hearts again. Only God can save our nation now. And we long for joy to fill our streets again. Only God can save our nation now</segment3>
		<segment4>How can it be that God is just?. When flesh is torn from young and old. And children run in bloody fields. Where is the hope?. Oh God we pray for white ribbon day</segment4>
		<segment5>And we pray for peace. To flood our hearts again. Only God can save our nation now. And we long for joy to fill our streets again. Only God can save our nation now</segment5>
		<segment6>Hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah for white ribbon day</segment6>
		<segment7>And can it be that You are just. When flesh was torn for young and old?. And here we stand saved by Your blood. We'll stand with courage. We'll live and die for white ribbon day</segment7>
		<segment8>Hallelujah, hallelujah, Hallelujah for white ribbon day    </segment8>
