		<segment1>Break the balance down. That's no way to go about it. Beautiful the sound. I heard those shackles hit the ground. You got me drowning in Your ocean</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Love's breaking me down. Like waves to stone, over and over. Your love's breaking new ground. Changing my every way</segment2>
		<segment3>Tear these towers down. And all that I built for myself. Lay a new foundation. I know You're not done with me yet. You got me drowning deep in Your ocean</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>You've got me living, truly living</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
