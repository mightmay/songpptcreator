		<segment1>So now your offering these hand me down beliefs. You offer neither solace nor relief. In a world of hate. Your words hold no weight</segment1>
		<segment2>So now your promising your Disney religion. Living in your world without sin. But I just don't relate. Your words hold no weight</segment2>
		<segment3>So just hold your tongue for a second. And spare me your two bit advice. Did God make me blind and give you my eyes?. So just hold your tongue until you can hold my burdens. Your ideas betray your fantasy. Your anecdotes mock reality. Your words hold no weight</segment3>
		<segment4>So before you go and throw your pearls before swine. Be warned you won't impress the likes of mine. Cause I've heard your debate. Your words hold no weight</segment4>
		<segment5>So why do they ring in my ear. And challenge my confidence?. They heckle my pride. My medicine never had this taste. My words in your mouth now sound misplaced. Your words hold no weight</segment5>
		<segment6>So share my pain and bare my wounds with me. Or don't pretend to call it sympathy. But you're so quick mock my misery. So quick to add insult to injury    </segment6>
