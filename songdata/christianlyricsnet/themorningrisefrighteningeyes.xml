		<segment1>Im packing for my last train. Im off to see the countryside. Im kissing my last lips. Will I make it till the morning time?</segment1>
		<segment2>Tossing and turning in sleep. I cant feel my heart beat. Oh maker of earth and the seas. Pray relief.</segment2>
		<segment3>I remember when we first kissed. Stayed up until the morning rise. Just cant go any further. I feel like Im going to die.</segment3>
		<segment4>Tossing and turning in sleep. I cant feel my heart beat. Oh maker of earth and the seas. Pray relief.</segment4>
		<segment5>When Im looking in the mirror, all I see is the frightening eyes. Can I make it any further? Can I make it to the morning rise?</segment5>
		<segment6>Tossing and turning in sleep. I cant feel my heart beat. Oh maker of earth and the seas. Pray relief.</segment6>
		<segment7>I believe.    </segment7>
