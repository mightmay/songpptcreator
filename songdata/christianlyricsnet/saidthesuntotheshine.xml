		<segment1>I'm like Parhelion, Earth's daystar. I'm like a luminary wizard, just like you are. I'm like a night incinerator, burning time. I got planet's radiating, solar system in the waiting. Integrating life lines carry on with your shine, shine. Everyone knows whether night or day. Find the light of dawn, you will carry on. Everyone knows whether night or day, carry on, carry on</segment1>
		<segment2>Said the Sun to the Shine. Said the Sun to the Shine. Come shadow what you find. Said the Sun to the Shine. Said the Sun to the Shine. You and I forever bind. Said the Sun to the Shine</segment2>
		<segment3>I am the light of life the brilliant morning star. And I have made you in my image. I am just like you are. Be my reflection to this world. You're my unique design. I got planet's radiating, solar system in the waiting. Integrating life lines carry on with your shine, shine. Said the Sun to the Sunshine. Said the Sun to the Sunshine    </segment3>
