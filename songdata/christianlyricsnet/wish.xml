		<segment1>For just a moment. I wish I could have been there. To see Your first step, hear Your very first word. Tell me, did You ever fall and scrape Your knee?. Did You know Your wounds would one day heal the world?. For just one moment. I wish I could have seen You growing. Learning the ways of a carpenter's son. Just a little boy gazing at the stars. Did You remember creating every one?. If you passed by, would I have seen a child or a King?</segment1>
		<segment2>Would I have known?. I wish I could have been there. My only wish is to see You, face to face. Wish I could have been there. Just to see You, Jesus, face to face</segment2>
		<segment3>For just a moment. I wish I could have been there. When You left Your footprints upon the waves. To walk along beside You and never look away. Just Your whisper and the wind and sea obey. To see You feed the people. To feel Your healing in Your touch</segment3>
		<segment4>I wish I could have been there. My only wish is to see You, face to face. Wish I could have been there. Just to see You, Jesus, face to face</segment4>
		<segment5>To hear you pray in the garden alone. Laying down Your will with each tear. To see You walk that lonely road. Willing to die for me. And in that moment. I know I should have been there. You took my cross and gave Your life. And you live again, oh. And You live again!</segment5>
		<segment6>Wish I could have been there. My only wish is to see You rise again. Wish I could have been there. My only wish is to see You, Jesus, face to face</segment6>
		<segment7>Someday I'll be there, I'm gonna be there. I'll see Your face, Your mercy, Your grace. Someday, someday. I'm going to see You, Jesus. Face to face.     </segment7>
