		<segment1>Exchanging beauty. For the ashes. Given my heart. To nothing real. [X2] </segment1>
		<segment2>I've given my heart away. To so many things. So many times I've failed. Help me stop this endless cycle. Remind me of how it can be </segment2>
		<segment3>Take me back. I surrender all. Without you. My heart is broken </segment3>
		<segment4>I never should have let you go. I never should have let you slip. Through my arms. [X5] </segment4>
		<segment5>As the sun sets tonight. I'll hold you with all that I am. [X3]. I never should have let you go. Promise me. You'll stay with me forever. Forever. [X3] </segment5>
		<segment6>Forgive me. For running so quickly to the outside. [X2]</segment6>
