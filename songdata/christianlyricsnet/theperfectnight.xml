		<segment1>Let's run as far as we can go tonight. We'll leave this world behind and forget the memories. Come on, run with me. come on, hold my hand. Don't slow down, we're almost there. Shake, shake, shake those hips. And dance with me. Tonight we're gonna dance. We're gonna run. And not look back. Come on. I've never felt my heart beat so fast. I wish this night would never end. No words describe this. Your face says everything. YOu wish this night would never end. We're gonna run and not look back. We won't stop till the morning light. We've never run this far before. Come on, come on. Don't look back. Run with me just a little further. We can make it. If we stay together. Look at us. We're almost there. Come on, come on. Don't look back. I've never felt my heart beat so fast. I wish this night would never end. No words describe this. Your face says everything. You wish this night would never end </segment1>
