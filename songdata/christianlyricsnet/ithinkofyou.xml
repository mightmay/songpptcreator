		<segment1>Verse 1:</segment1>
		<segment2>When I think of sunlight piercing through the clouds to paint the perfect sky, I think of the silver lining of Your love, and I think of You.</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2:</segment3>
		<segment4>When I think of streams that weave through desert lands as beauty comes alive, I think of the healing fountain of Your grace in my life, in my life.</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus:</segment5>
		<segment6>And I think of You who shines with endless light through broken jars of clay. And I think of You redeeming every part of each day that Youve made. And I think of You.</segment6>
		<segment7>Verse 3</segment7>
		<segment8>When I think of children laughing, full of wonder, and families reconciled, I think of the joy thats found in answered prayer, and it makes me smile, makes me smile!</segment8>
		<segment9>Bridge:</segment9>
		<segment10>And I think of You, for redemptions now the story of my soul.</segment10>
		<segment11>Chorus 2:</segment11>
		<segment12>Cause it was You who paid the highest price for broken jars of clay. And you still choose to use my life for Your glory displayed.    </segment12>
