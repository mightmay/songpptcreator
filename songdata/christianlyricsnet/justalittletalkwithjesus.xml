		<segment1>I once was lost in sin, Jesus took me in. And then a light from heaven filled my soul. He filled my heart with love, wrote my name above. Just a talk with Jesus makes it all right. (repeat)</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. Have a little talk with Jesus. Tell God about your troubles. He'll hear the faintest cry. And answer bye and bye. Feel the prayer wheel turning. Know that the fire's burning. Just a talk with Jesus makes it all right</segment2>
		<segment3>(repeat chorus..)    </segment3>
