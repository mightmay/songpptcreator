		<segment1>So much for fame and things you can lose. So much for substitutes. So much for the strain of playing a game. Where champions always lose everything. I won't treat Your love. Like an adolescent fling. 'Cause when everyone's gone. You're the only one who stays</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I'd rather be Your stone. Than light up another's sky. I'd rather be Your stone. 'Cause all your stones become your diamonds</segment2>
		<segment3>You gave me a name I could never gain. With even my college try. Convinced by Your touch, it was more than enough. I'm leaving old treasures in the dust. 'Cause I found this pearl. I'd give everything to have, I have it</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Out of darkest deep, You dig me up. And You crush me and You lift me up. And to give You thanks. I can only love You more</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
