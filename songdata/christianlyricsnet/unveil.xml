		<segment1>I know as I envision. Your never ending power. Your splendor is more. Than I can imagine</segment1>
		<segment2>Ive heard of Your perfections. But Ive been blind to You. Open my eyes. Open my ears. Open my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Unveil my eyes. So I can see Your glory. Unveil my eyes. So I can know Youre here. Youre here</segment3>
		<segment4>Your love, it overtakes me. And makes me who I am. As I am undone. In light of Your glory</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge. Take apart this world. That I have made. Make this heart aware. Of more than me. Reveal to me the depths. Of who You are. And come and teach me like a child. To trust Your heart.     </segment5>
