		<segment1>Freedom is a luxury you can't afford. When you're working minimum wage at the corner store. When little children are preyed on in their own homes. When you're working at the factory. Making parts for your radio</segment1>
		<segment2>Freedom is a luxury</segment2>
		<segment3>Freedom is a luxury you can't afford. When you've walked all day and your feet are sore. When it's five miles to the next grocery store. When you're slaving over 40 hrs. Slaving for your slave's wage. Freedom is a luxury</segment3>
		<segment4>Freedom is a luxury you can't afford. When you're working minimum wage at the corner store. When you've walked all day and your feet are sore. When you're slaving at the factory. Making parts for your radio. Slaving for your slaves wage. Freedom is a luxury you can't afford</segment4>
		<segment5>Everywhere is war    </segment5>
