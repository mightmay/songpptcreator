		<segment1>There I was completely wasting. Out of work and down. All inside it's so frustrating. As I drift from town to town. Feel as though nobody cares. If I live or die. So I might as well begin. To put some action in my life</segment1>
		<segment2>Breaking the law, breaking the law</segment2>
		<segment3>So much for the golden future. I can't even start. I've had every promise broken. And there's anger in my heart. You don't know what it's like. You don't have a clue. If you did you'd find yourselves. Doing the same thing too</segment3>
		<segment4>Breaking the law, breaking the law</segment4>
