		<segment1>I don't believe in ghosts cuz that ain't what I see. I can't deny the supernatural in me</segment1>
		<segment2>It seems real as hell</segment2>
		<segment3>If you don't understand it still just might be true. On every third Halloween now. It's gonna take over you. From another dimension comes writing on the wall. The letters all run backwards and somebody takes a fall    </segment3>
