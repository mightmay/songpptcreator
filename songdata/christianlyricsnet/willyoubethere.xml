		<segment1>As I fall to sleep. Will you comfort me. When my heart is weak. Will you rescue me</segment1>
		<segment2>Will you be there. As I grow cold. Will you be there when I'm falling down. Will you be there</segment2>
		<segment3>When I'm in retreat. Can I run to you. Will my pain release. At your mercy seat</segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS:]. Will you be there. As I grow cold. Will you be there when I'm falling down. Will you be there. My heart grows cold. Will you be there when I'm falling down. Are you saying yes. I gotta believe it. Are you saying yeah. When your love comes down I can rest my eyes. Feel your grace and power flood into my life. As my brokenness and your strength collide. When your love comes down. Falling Down</segment4>
		<segment5>As I fall to sleep</segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS]</segment6>
		<segment7>As I grow cold</segment7>
		<segment8>Will you be there. My heart grows cold. Will you be there when I'm falling down    </segment8>
