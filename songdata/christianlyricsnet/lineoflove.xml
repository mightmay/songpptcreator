		<segment1>Okay, You're right. I cannot fight this all alone. Let in the light i need to know</segment1>
		<segment2>Your line of love goes on and on. Drawn in a circle, drawn upon. My heart and i can't erase it</segment2>
		<segment3>This line of love connecting me. To You, forever knowing. When i fall You'll help me to face it</segment3>
		<segment4>Facing myself. Hasn't been easy. Can't hide any longer. Those days are through</segment4>
		<segment5>Your line of love goes on and on. Leads to a place where i belong. Where mercy waits to embrace me</segment5>
		<segment6>This line of love that draws me in. Forgiving forgetting my sin. And in Your grace it has traced me    </segment6>
