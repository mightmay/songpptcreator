		<segment1>When I waited so long, when my tears were my song. With my hope nearly gone You held me God. To believe in the face of the dry, weary place. When You felt far away You held me God</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh, there is freedom in surrender, oh I know it</segment2>
		<segment3>Your songs have never stopped. You've been singing, always singing over me. Your words are still enough. And You're singing, always singing over me</segment3>
		<segment4>The chaos in the cause teaching me to see Lord. The beauty in the storm so I believe. When I see through Your eyes through the testing of time. Every cloud silver lined 'cause You're with me</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, there is freedom in surrender, oh I know it</segment5>
		<segment6>Your songs have never stopped. You've been singing, always singing over me. Your words are still enough. And You're singing</segment6>
		<segment7>Give me faith. Give me strength enough to wait. To stand in faith. And listen for, listen for Your melody</segment7>
		<segment8>Your songs have never stopped. Your songs have never stopped</segment8>
		<segment9>Your songs have never stopped. You've been singing, always singing over me. Your words are still enough. And You're singing, always singing over me</segment9>
		<segment10>Your songs have never stopped. You've been singing, always singing over me. Your words are still enough. And You're singing, always singing over me. Always singing over me, always singing over me. Always singing over me    </segment10>
