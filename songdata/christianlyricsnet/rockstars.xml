		<segment1>she moves to L.A. she wants to be somebody. three and a half years later she's still not anybody. she's still hoping for a break while she's waiting tables. realizing some dreams are fables. fear grows when she knows that she's out of control. throwing up in the bathroom hope that nobody knows. and she fears she's a failure she forgets that God loves her </segment1>
		<segment2>you tried and you failed hold your head up high. you climbed and you fell hold your head up high. you tried and you failed hold your head up high. hold your head up hold your head up high </segment2>
		<segment3>[chorus]. coz if we never make it ever then it's gonna be ok with me. coz if it's not ok to fall sometimes it's not ok to be. if they don't want us it's ok honest. it doesn't have to bring me down. let them say we're not big rock stars. it's not what we're about. we don't have to be rock stars. we don't have to be rock stars </segment3>
		<segment4>they said he'd never make it maybe they're right. his parents never believe that his dreams could take flight. all he ever wanted was for them to be proud of him. it was the whole world to him he needed to win. he gave his everything but sometimes it's not enough. he thinks he's a failure now he's not worth being loved. he forgets he had the courage to climb up so high. the courage to try, the courage to fly </segment4>
		<segment5>. you tried and you failed hold your head up high. you climbed and you fell hold your head up high. you tried and you failed hold your head up high. hold your head up hold your head up high. [chorus] </segment5>
		<segment6>it's not about success life is not a test. you don't pass or fail you just do your best. to see the view from wings of courage. to push on through when we're discouraged. it's all about the try all about the ride. learning how you were meant to touch the sky. failures are fliers who touch down. only they know what it's like to leave the ground. [chorus]     </segment6>
