		<segment1>Better get out it's a Hurricane. Oh a spinning sonic wind is gonna blow you away. Either get knocked out or get outta the way. Oh you better get out it's a Hurricane</segment1>
		<segment2>You don't even know it's there. A gentle breeze teases through your hair. Flirting back it's all so great. Better get before too late. Run away Run away OK run away OK. OK get away get away get away</segment2>
		<segment3>Take a breath of sin sweet air. Wind blows faster through your hair. Wrap yourself in cello-phane. You can't breathe can't get away. Get away, Mayday, Get away, Mayday, Get away, Mayday, Mayday</segment3>
		<segment4>Spinning fast and do you care?. This spinning downward makes you scared. Jesus hands and calming waves. Jesus hands a gust of change. Come away today, come away today. Come away, come away, come away     </segment4>
