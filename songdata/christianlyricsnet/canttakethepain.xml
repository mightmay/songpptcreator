		<segment1>No, I didn't see this one coming. It suddenly snuck up on me. I can't say you didn't tell me so. I can't say you didn't warn me. I can't take the pain of knowing that I left You. I can't bear the shame of knowing I was wrong. But I'll take the blame for everything that I've done. I can't take the pain of leaving you alone. Of leaving you alone</segment1>
		<segment2>I was there when they accused you. but I guess I was too afraid. Not just once and not just twice. But three times I denied your name</segment2>
		<segment3>I never thought I'd get even a second chance. But you've given that and so much more. And then for every time I ever did deny. You ask me if I love you, You know I do, Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>So I'm off to follow in your steps. it won't be easy, it's safe to say. There are only tow roads I can walk on down. The road less traveled is the one you paved</segment4>
		<segment5>Lord, You took the pain even though I left You. And You took the shame and You made it all Your own. Why'd you take the blame for everything that I've done?. Lord, You took the pain. You and You alone, You and You alone    </segment5>
