		<segment1>You. Hold the world in motion. You say the world and heaven opens. You flung the stars into space. God of wonders. You know my name</segment1>
		<segment2>When the day is gone. and the house is still. My hungry soul cries out. To find You. And You're waiting for me. Waiting for me</segment2>

		<segment5>In a crowded world. Your faithfulness. Reaches to hold me. Ever thankful. That I am loved by You</segment5>
		<segment6>There's an anthem. Beckoing in me to sing. I'll play it for You, play it for You. There's a song of hope. That I need to bring. I'll sing it for You, I'll sing it for You</segment6>
		<segment7>Every time I call Your name I know. You're waiting for me, waiting for me. Every day and night. I come and bow. Before Your throne</segment7>
