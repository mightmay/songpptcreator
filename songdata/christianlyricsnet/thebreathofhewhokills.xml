		<segment1>Though saturated in blood Im standing still in fear. I feel the tears of those who mourn and the breath of he who kills. I feel it on my face. My heart cries to speak, my lungs gasp to breathe, for hes got me by the throat.</segment1>
		<segment2>His grip is on me clutching me tight, shadowing black and holding me from Gods light. His grip is on me as dark as the night, spewing blasphemy and taking my sight. He suffocates our life supply and manipulates the Word by which we survive. He suffocates our life supply and manipulates the Word by which we survive.</segment2>
		<segment3>Though saturated in blood Im standing still in fear. I feel the tears of those who mourn and the breath of he who kills. I hear the sounds of hate. My thoughts are clouded by pain. My ears are filled with lies for his words pierce my ears.</segment3>
		<segment4>His voice deafens and silenced through this death, as my lungs fill with the breath of He who gives life.     </segment4>
