		<segment1>I'm too scared to move, too scared to lose. Tell me what I am supposed to do. I'm too close to see you, but too far to touch. And too many times I've not done enough</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm too close to see you, too far to touch, And too many times I've not done enough. I'm too strong to hurt you, too weak to crush. I want to, oh, oh, let go</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh-oh let's go everyone out the door. When you hear it go, hear it go, hit the floor. Let's go everyone hit the floor. When you hear it go, hear it go out the door. Oh-oh, let's go hit the floor. When you hear the sound hit the floor. Oh-oh, let's go hit the floor, oh-oh here we go, here we go</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm too scared to choose, scared to refuse. Tell me what I am supposed to do?. I'm too wrong to be you, too right to blush. And too many times I've not done enough</segment4>
		<segment5>Tonight I walk alone no matter where I've been. No matter where I've gone, I know. Green lights mean time to go. But I won't let them in 'cause I might lose control.     </segment5>
