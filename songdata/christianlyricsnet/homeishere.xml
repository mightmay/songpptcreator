		<segment1>Holding on when it seems that your grip is failing. Whos to say that you cant take it back?. Live your life as if you know this is your last day. Make the choice to live forever. </segment1>
		<segment2>The decisions weighing the answer is yours. You cant wait forever dont let yourself hit the floor. The prodigal one wont you return. The light is on the door is open. You bed is made your home is here. Come back and laugh and we will forget. Everything youve done wrong is gone here. </segment2>
		<segment3>Stepping back to see footprints youve left in your path. Stepping up for everything youve done. Now move on pack up your thoughts and keep on going. Keep the faith and you will be all right. Receive the prayers prayed for you here.    </segment3>
