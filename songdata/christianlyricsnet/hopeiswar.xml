		<segment1>So this is what comes to mind. This red pen tracing steps back inside. Worry or doubt for the best. These times always show my condition. Red lights stop me, crawling back to ro reflection. Each time for these lines, I set goals so high. &quot;Break past your wall, to rise above the stubbornness of us all&quot;. It's one more unreachable goal. I am like a story, ups and downs. The end is scary; it shows no mercy. The end could grow me older. The end could make it over. It's all over. One more day to say, &quot;One day at a time&quot;. Would my life make you believe in the story?. This is not warrior's blood drawn. It's a fool's cry for help    </segment1>
