		<segment1>No I'm not mad but I think they forget. What it's like and how hard it is to be a teenager. This is a new day and age, we read a different book. Where elvis ain't the rage and polyester ain't the look. And will we change at all when we get old?. Or will we be the same? never do what were told. Well that depends on you, are you doing the right thing?. It's not about control, it's about you and me and understanding. Teenage politics it's too confusing. Politics shmolitics it's too confusing. Is it time again to disagree. About anything, everything and what's on tv. It's a vicious circle, never ending. A linear equation worldy extending. No ill never be like you ill never ever be like you. Oh no! I'm just like you!.     </segment1>
