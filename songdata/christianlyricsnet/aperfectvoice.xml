		<segment1> may not have a perfect voice but Ill still sing at the top of my lungs. Until my days are done. I was once a child with a million plans now all Ive got is what's in my hands. I dont leave much to chance these days. I may not ever see a dime but Ill be fine. Yeah Ill still get by. All the time a smile upon my face. You might see me on the corner with a cup someday. And Ill smile and wave. And say &quot;God bless you for your change today&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>Whoa oh whoa oh oh oh</segment2>
		<segment3>I may not be a perfect man but Ill still stand. Yeah Im counting on grace to win this race for me in the end. I may not sing your favorite songs but I dont sing for you. Cause if I did I would have been done long ago</segment3>
		<segment4>Woah oh woah oh oh oh</segment4>
		<segment5>I may not have a perfect voice but I won't lie. Ill sing until I die. Because I may not get the chance another night     </segment5>
