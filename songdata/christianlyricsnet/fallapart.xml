		<segment1>Why in the world did I think I could. Only get to know you when my life was good?. When everything just falls in place. The easiest thing is to give you praise. Now it all seems upside down</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause my whole world is caving in. But I feel you now more than I did then. How can I come to the end of me. But somehow still have all I need?. God I want to know you more. Maybe this is how it starts. I find you when I fall apart</segment2>
		<segment3>Blessed are the ones who understand. They've got nothing to bring but empty hands. Nothing to hide and nothing to prove. Our heartbreak brings us back to you. And it all seems upside down</segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause my whole world is caving in. But I feel you now more than I did then. How can I come to the end of me. But somehow still have all I need?. God I want to know you more. Maybe this is how it starts. I find you when I fall apart</segment4>
		<segment5>I don't know how long this will last. I'm praying for the pain to pass. But maybe this is the best thing that has ever happened to me</segment5>
		<segment6>'Cause my whole world is caving in. But I feel you now more than I did then. How can I come to the end of me. But somehow still have all I need?. God I want to know you more. Maybe this is how it starts. I find you when--. You will find me when--. I fall apart    </segment6>
