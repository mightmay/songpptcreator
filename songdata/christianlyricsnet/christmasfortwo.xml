		<segment1>They can have their trimmed up tree. Dressing up on christmas eve. There's so many other things. We'd rather do. . Like makin' angels in the snow. Playin' records soft and low. Bundle up and watch the fire grow. Me and you. . Though we've time to spare. Without a care. We don't need nothin' new. Some mistletoe a lover's glow. And a table dressed for two. Yeah i'd rather have christmas with you. . Shopping days are almost done. Shoppin' never was much fun. Without my one and only one. It's all just blue. . But we've time to spare without a care. We don't need nothin' new. Some mistletoe a lover's glow. And a table dressed for two. Oh i'd rather have christmas with you. . Rudolph frosty christmas lights. Jingle bells and silent night;. It's always right in front of you. . Yeah we've time to spare without a care. We don't need nothin' new. Some mistletoe a lover's glow. And a table dressed for two. Oh i'd rather have christmas with you. Yes i'd rather have christmas with you. Ahh i'd rather have christmas with you.    </segment1>
