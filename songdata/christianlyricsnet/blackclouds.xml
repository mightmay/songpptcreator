		<segment1>Well here you are. Same story all over again. You're wondering why. You don't even know where you've been. Sitting all alone now. Those walls keep closing in. You're searching for something never satisfied in the end. Here you go. It starts again. Those black clouds are hanging over you my friend. So many choices to make. Which road will you take?. Now the trap is set. Waiting on your next move. What's it gonna be my friend?. Will you win or will you lose?. It's yours to make now. Which road will you choose?. I often wonder which spell you are living under?. Did you always think that your life would end this way?. Breathe in breathe out. Come on you can let it out. Breathe in breathe out. What's it all about?    </segment1>
