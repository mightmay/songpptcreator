		<segment1>Sitting up on the roof sneaking a smoke by the chimney. Checking out the moon and the city lights. Takes off his flannel shirt drapes it around her shoulders. Slides up behind her and holds on tight (and she says). I don't want this night to end why does it have to end</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Tomorrow she'll be rolling down I-10. Baton Rouge LSU eighteen years in her rearview. He's got a Friday paycheck lined up. Down the block Daddy's shop it ain't much but it's a job. They've been dreading this moment all summer long. The night before life goes on</segment2>
		<segment3>A tear falls off her cheek right when it hits his arm (he says). C 'mon baby let's get out of here. They take one last drive round town man it already looks different. He bangs the wheel says Life Ain't Fair. This growing up stuff man I don't knowjust don't wanna let you go</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge: That's what my mama told me and just like those kids I didn't. I didn't wanna listen to no one. There's nothing you can do nothing you can say I know how it feels. When love goes away </segment4>
		<segment5>. Repeat chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Outro: They've been dreading this moment all summer long. But here it is they don't have longthe night before life goes on</segment6>
