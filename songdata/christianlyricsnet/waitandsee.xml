		<segment1>I was born in Tennessee. Late July humidity. Doctor said I was lucky to be alive</segment1>
		<segment2>Ive been trouble since the day that I got here. Trouble till the day that I disappear. Thatll be the day that I finally get it right</segment2>
		<segment3>There is hope for me yet. Because God wont forget. All the plans hes made for me. I have to wait and see. Hes not finished with me yet</segment3>
		<segment4>I never really was that good in school. I talked too much, broke the rules. Teacher thought I was hopeless fool alright</segment4>
		<segment5>I dont know how but I made it through. Its one of those things that youve gotta do. But I always had a knack for telling the truth</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Still wondering why Im here. Still wrestling with my fear. But oh, Hes up to something. And the farther on I go. Ive seen enough to know. That Im, not here for nothing. Hes up to something</segment7>
		<segment8>So nows my time to be a man. Follow my heart as far as I can. No telling where Im ending up tonight. I never slow down or so it seems. But singing my heart its one of my dreams. All I gotta do is hold on tight</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus</segment9>
