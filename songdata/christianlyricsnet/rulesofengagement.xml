		<segment1>Expectations of actions  that conform. Foreign beliefs  put in position to be killed. You have to go  you have to fight. Theres no one else thats capable. No one else would even dare</segment1>
		<segment2>Put your life on the line without a word. Silent and stealth / Just like you were trained to kill</segment2>
		<segment3>Your hands are tied / Youve been compromised. As the bullets rain down on your hide</segment3>
		<segment4>Twenty yards and counting / The ememy rears his head. Black eyes glaring hate / In his heart</segment4>
		<segment5>Blood and sweat mixed with earth / Bloody mess, stench of death. Blood and sweat mixed with earth / Searing flesh is what youre worth</segment5>
		<segment6>Your hands are tied / Youve been compromised. As the bullets rain down on your hide. Your hands are tied / Youve been compromised. As the bullets rain down on your hide    </segment6>
