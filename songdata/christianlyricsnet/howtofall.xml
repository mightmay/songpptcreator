		<segment1>It was prettier than poetry. The first time you said hello to me. Call it crazy, call it meant to be, yeah. But it didnt take me long to see </segment1>
		<segment2>That you mean more than anyone</segment2>
		<segment3>Im running in circles, jumping over hurdles. Working on a song to sing. I want to tell you how Im feeling. Finding it hard to do. Cause I dont know how to say it, dont know how youll take it. Dont know how to fall in love. But I want to learn with you</segment3>
		<segment4>My friends say I should take it slow. But my dad says when you know, you know. So maybe Ill just rent a car. And Ill drive right back to where you are</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause you mean more than anything</segment5>
		<segment6>I never thought Id drop my guard. Then you broke into my clumsy heart    </segment6>
