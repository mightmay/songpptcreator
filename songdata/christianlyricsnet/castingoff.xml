		<segment1>Can you forget all the lies you're told?. Will you let go of all the things you hold?. They can cost you more than you could know. But what will you do when everything's gone?</segment1>
		<segment2>I saw you under the stars. And I caught you wanting them all. Desire can change who you are. You're so much better off. When nothing weighs you down</segment2>
		<segment3>Breaking down, you're starting to see. The world's worth nothing when you were meant for Me. So cast off those stars they only fall for Me. I am still here when everything's gone</segment3>
		<segment4>I saw you under the stars. And I caught you wanting them all. Desire can change who you are. You're so much better off. When nothing weighs you down</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm here. Let Me tear your heart out. Stay here- I can make it better </segment5>
		<segment6>.     </segment6>
