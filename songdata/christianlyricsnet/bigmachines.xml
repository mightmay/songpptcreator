		<segment1>I wonder where you're at. Onto better things. And you want it now. I wonder if you'll ask. All the big machines. And I'm all done</segment1>
		<segment2>Why do I ask?. Out of all the things. That I could be doing. How do I hide?. To waste my time</segment2>
		<segment3>I wonder where you're at. You avoid these things. You want it now. You're something that you're not. And you'll never be. All that good to me. Always a new tad. All the things that we had, tonight. All I want to do is disappear in darkness. Forget you</segment3>
		<segment4>Wandering from my eyes, I'm done. The shriveling of my skin makes you. Don't you think if I got too young. Then all of this would make us all done, done. Bye</segment4>
		<segment5>You're something that you're not. And you'll never be. All that good to me. Always a new tad. That all the things that we had tonight. And all I want to do is disappear in darkness. Forget you</segment5>
		<segment6>Wandering from my eyes, I'm done. The shriveling of my skin makes you. Don't you think if I got too young. Then all of this would make us all done, done. Bye</segment6>
		<segment7>Bye bye, bye bye. I'm all done, with us, with us. And I say bye bye, bye bye. I'm all done with us, with us. (Don't you think if I got too young. Then all of this would make us all done, done)    </segment7>
