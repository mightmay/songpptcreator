		<segment1>This is my beloved son. Who tasted death. That you, my child, might live. See the blood He shed for You. What suffering. Say what more could He give. Clothed in His perfection. Bring praise, a fragrance sweet. Garlanded with joy. Come worship at His feet</segment1>
		<segment2>That the Lamb who was slain. Might receive the reward. Might receive the reward of His suffering</segment2>
		<segment3>Look, the worlds great harvest fields. Are ready now. And Christ commands us: Go!. Countless souls are dying. So hopelessly. His wondrous love unknown. Lord, give us the nations. For the glory of the King. Father, send more labourers. The lost to gather in</segment3>
		<segment4>Come the day when we will stand. There face to face. What joy will fill His eyes. For at last His Bride appears. So beautiful. Her glory fills the skies. Drawn from every nation. People, tribe and tongue. All creation sings. The wedding has begun</segment4>
		<segment5>And the Lamb who was slain. Shall receive the reward. Shall receive the reward of His suffering</segment5>
