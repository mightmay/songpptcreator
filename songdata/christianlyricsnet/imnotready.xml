		<segment1>Every time I read that story again. I wanna run and take the nails out. You remind me that those nails are mine. Once and for all to the end (Hebrews 9:26)</segment1>
		<segment2>Im not ready for this. Im not ready yet. Im not ready. For this ending. But its not over yet</segment2>
		<segment3>You were speaking to a group last night. You asked someone to lay their pride out. I turned to see who it could be. You were looking me dead in the eye</segment3>
		<segment4>Im not ready for this. Im not ready yet. Im not ready. For this ending. But its not over yet</segment4>
		<segment5>Im not ready for this. Im not ready yet. Im not ready. For this ending. But its not over yet. Ive been fighting against myself. And Ive torn myself to pieces. I hear You calling, God, I hear You calling. Stand up, stand up. And spend yourself for Jesus</segment5>
		<segment6>Too long have I been chained. Im ready Jesusset me free    </segment6>
