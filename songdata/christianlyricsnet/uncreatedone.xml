		<segment1>Holy Uncreated One. Your beauty fills the skies. But the glory of Your majesty. Is the mercy in Your eyes</segment1>
		<segment2>And Worthy Uncreated One. From heaven to earth come down. You laid aside Your royalty. To wear the sinner's crown</segment2>
		<segment3>And, O Great God, be glorified. Our lives laid down, Yours magnified. O Great God be lifted high. There is none like You</segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus, Savior, God's own Son, Risen, reigning Lord. Sustainer of the universe. By the power of Your word</segment4>
		<segment5>And, O Great God, be glorified. Our lives laid down, Yours magnified. O Great God be lifted high. There is none like You. There is none like You. There is none like You</segment5>
		<segment6>And when we see Your matchless face. In speechless awe we'll stand. And there we'll bow with grateful hearts. Unto the Great I Am</segment6>
		<segment7>And, O Great God, be glorified. Our lives lais down, Yours magnified. O Great God be lifted high. There is none like You. There is none like You    </segment7>
