		<segment1>..But Jesus comes to me. While I watch and wait. And long for peace</segment1>
		<segment2>He is always there. It's where I belong. For the road I'm on is long</segment2>
		<segment3>Be with Him. I'll be with Him. Until the day I die</segment3>
		<segment4>And Jesus comes to me. He's my everything. He's all I need (for me)</segment4>
		<segment5>And His voice I hear (I hear it all the time). He's opened up my eyes. It's clear the reason why</segment5>
		<segment6>Be with Him. I'll be with Him. Until the day I die</segment6>
		<segment7>Until the day I die. Jesus comes to lead me on. Taking me home with Him. Where I'll be with Him forever    </segment7>
