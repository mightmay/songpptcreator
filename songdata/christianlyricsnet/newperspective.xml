		<segment1>I always thought I had it figured out. No need for the benefit of the doubt. I could never look beyond what. I could see I was in control and it was all about me. I'm so sick and tired. Of this selfish life.. I want more</segment1>
		<segment2>Reach up, reach out. This house is burning down. These walls we've built are caving in. Reach up, don't give up. We're standing on the ashes. With a clearer view and a new perspective</segment2>
		<segment3>I can feel the hardness breaking up inside. Shattered by the tears falling from their eyes. I just want to push beyond the boundaries. Surrendering all control 'cause it's not about me. They're so sick and tired. Of our selfish lives.. they need more</segment3>
		<segment4>Reach up (we know they need us). Reach out (and they're all around us). This house is burning down. These walls we've built are caving in. Reach up (it's a new beginning). Don't give up (with the love we're giving). We're standing on the ashes. With a clearer view and a new perspective</segment4>
		<segment5>We need to open up our eyes. See it written on their faces?. We are running out of time. Is there no one who will save them?. I'm reaching out    </segment5>
