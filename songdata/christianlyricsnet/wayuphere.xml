		<segment1>I walk along this winding road. Too many voices tell me which way to go. Sometimes this heart gets so confused. I need you Lord to show me. Which path to choose. And I'm longing for that place way up high. Where God's air is sweet and I touch the sky</segment1>
		<segment2>Way up here I can see the far horizon. All the world before my eyes is clear to see. Way up here where my Father always meets me. On this mountain where he heals me I can rest. Way up here</segment2>
		<segment3>Rising above this life we know. Leaving the streams of sorrow far down below. I feel the touch of God's loving hand. Restoring me in ways I can't understand. If I fall away his love reaches me. And he brings me back. To the edge of my dreams</segment3>
		<segment4>Way up here I can see the far horizon. All the world before my eyes is clear to see. Way up here where my Father always meets me. On this mountain where he heals me I can rest. Way up here</segment4>
		<segment5>No matter where we travel, no need to fear the shadows. My God is there. His light is there to follow. Back to the quiet waters. I know he cares</segment5>
		<segment6>Way up here I can see the far horizon. All the world before my eyes is clear to see. Way up here where my Father always meets me. On this mountain where he heals me I can rest. Way up here. (chorus repeated)    </segment6>
