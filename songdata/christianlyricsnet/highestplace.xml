		<segment1>VERSE 1: Lord You search me. And You know me. You hear all of my thoughts. No point in hiding. Lord Youve found me. So completely in need of You. I cannot run from You</segment1>
		<segment2>PRE-CHORUS: If I go to the heavens or down below. You are right there waiting. If I rise on the wings of the dawn. You are there, I will find You waiting</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: You are in the highest place. You are in the falling rain. You are in the mountain peaks. And valleys speak wonders of Your name. You are in the perfect sky. You're in every breath I breathe. You're in every moment. Life seems to pass me by. You're my prince of peace</segment3>
		<segment4>VERSE 2: In the glory. Of Your glory. I become like You are. Its over whelming. In the presence. Of Your presence. I finally see. All Your love, for me. PRE-CHORUS: </segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge: You're everything. You're in everything. You're in every cry. It all ends and starts. With you my king. (Repeat)</segment6>
