		<segment1>I am here all alone. It's just You, me and this broken prayer. How I've longed to share. The feelings of this restless heart. It's been a long and narrow road. And my feet are bare with no soul. And when I fall down to the ground. I'll get back up and carry on</segment1>
		<segment2>'Cause I'm longing to know You. Longing to find You. Longing feel You deep inside. You know that I love You. You know that I trust You. Sometimes it's hard to feel You next to me</segment2>
		<segment3>But I'll carry on. I'll carry on</segment3>
		<segment4>When Your wind blows. It leads me to places unknown. I may not see You. But I can feel You leading me on</segment4>
		<segment5>And when I find You. You'll be there with Your arms open wide. Until that day comes. Yes, I have the hope of new life</segment5>
		<segment6>So I'll carry on. I'll carry on, I'll carry on</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm longing to know You. I'm longing to find You. Longing feel You deep inside. You know that I love You. You know that I trust You. Sometimes it's hard to feel You next to me    </segment7>
