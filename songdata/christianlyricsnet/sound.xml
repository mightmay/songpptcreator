		<segment1>If I only had an ocean to compliment the sky. I'd pull it down and paint it for you and I'd never question why. Cause &quot;red would mean you loved me&quot;. And &quot;blue would mean you cared&quot;. But black my heart when left alone to cold and killing stairs. This is the burning of a dream. This is the burning of a dream </segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. The sound now turns to silence. But I'll keep spinning around. Naked in the rain of my own tears. As they fall into the bucket of your apologies. While closing everyone else's eyes. Because your own are shut. Not to see the volume rise again </segment2>
		<segment3>Feels like I'm waiting in the last hiding place on earth. Haman's noose tight round my neck but im saved. and for 100,000 memories been washed ashore. Be swept again by forever. And sailed away from you </segment3>
		<segment4>Now the rain has ended. So the sun can shine through me </segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus]. The sound now turns to silence. But I keep spinning around. Naked in the rain of my own tears. As they fall into the bucket of your apologies. While closing everyone else's eyes. Because your own are shut. Not to see the volume rise again </segment5>
		<segment6>Only you could row my boat ashore. Only you could set my fears at rest. But until lack of sympathies regress. I'm still waiting.. I'm still waiting for your call </segment6>
		<segment7>[Chorus]. The sound now turns to silence. But I keep spinning around. Naked in the rain of my own tears. As they fall into the bucket of your apologies. While closing everyone else's eyes. Because your own are shut. Not to see the volume rise again.     </segment7>
