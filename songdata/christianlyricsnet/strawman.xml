		<segment1>falling, failing now. they mass here at mid day. such a quandary how. I was with them so long. again, I was wrong. you're kneeling there. with furtive eyes on me. and you say. turn your head, face the jury. turn again, face your peers. we have gathered to listen. to what we want to hear</segment1>
		<segment2>bemused, confused so. much ado about nothing. abuse ensues, though. when I reply, you offer. you try, you falter. a spool of thread, a needle won't help me</segment2>
		<segment3>is your faith so precarious. that you attack me and not my questions?    </segment3>
