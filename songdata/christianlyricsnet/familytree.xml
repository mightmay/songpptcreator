		<segment1>He was. A beautiful shade of chocolate. She was. A beautiful shade of red. And under the watchful eyes of heaven. Afro Indian girl boy were wed. Little did they know. So long ago. Flowers would come. From the seed they'd sown. Yeah, little did they know. What would come to be. A forest would grow. From the soil and the seed. And these are the branches. In my family tree. Napoleon, Betsy, Isaac, Eloise. Under their branches. I can feel a breeze. Where the leaves from the trees. Make a canopy for me to. Live in the shade, yeah. The leaves from their trees. Made a canopy for me. To live in the shade.. I wanna thank you. Cause you took the heat for me. You took the heat for me..    </segment1>
