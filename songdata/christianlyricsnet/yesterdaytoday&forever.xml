		<segment1>Everlasting God. The years go by but youÂ’re unchanging. In this fragile world. You are the only firm foundation. Always loving, always true. Always merciful and good, so good </segment1>
		<segment2>Yesterday today and forever. You are the same, you never change. Yesterday today and forever. You are faithful and we will trust in You </segment2>
		<segment3>Uncreated One. You have no end and no beginning. Earthly power fades. But there is no end to Your kingdom. Always loving, always true. Always merciful and good, so good </segment3>
		<segment4>Yahweh, God unchanging. Yahweh, firm foundation. Yahweh, God unchanging. Yahweh, firm foundation    </segment4>
