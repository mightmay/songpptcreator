		<segment1>the farmer drove his tractor. where the soil had been tilled. planting corn in rank and file. from the silo to the lumber mill. he rode along in silence. as looked out past the honeysuckle field. watched the water turn. turn the water wheel. started thinking about his daughter's affection. her reaction of disdain. the day he replaced the blue hydrangea. with the climbing grain. while her disappointed sister. looked on quiet as the snow. knowing well that those that know don't talk. and those that talk don't know</segment1>
		<segment2>but she couldn't help but sing</segment2>
		<segment3>the tortoise in the wheelchair. wrapped his forehead in a bandage. with a cast they made from plaster. for his phony broken leg. so he'd get pushed around the sidewalk. by the zookeeper's assistant. with the hummingbird obeserving. from behind the yellow flower. and he flapped his tiny wings. they moved so fast you couldn't see them. with resentment for the tortoise. which was clear by his expression. but the tortoise turned and smiled. with a peacefulness which proved. that there's a movement in our stillness. and however much we move</segment3>
		<segment4>we're bound to stand completely still</segment4>
		<segment5>come tortoise, standing still. go hummingbird, my will. come tortoise, stumbling blind. go hummingbird, my eyes. come tortoise, empty hand. go hummingbird, my plan. come tortoise, undefined. go hummingbird, my mind. come tortoise, letting go. go hummingbird, i know. come tortoise, come and die. go hummingbird, my I. goodbye, I. goodbye, I. bye, bye, bye     </segment5>
