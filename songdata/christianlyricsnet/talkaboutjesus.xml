		<segment1>You never told me, but you always said. You'll be here, we'll pray for you. Echoes in my head. I still remember, longing to escape. Like a man in prison chains, is my life in vain </segment1>
		<segment2>I cry out for you to hear. And I wonder does anybody care. You talk about Jesus, how He set you free. You talk about a Savior, how He died for me. I don't understand it, what you're talking about. All I feel is pain when I look around </segment2>
		<segment3>All I ever wanted, never wanted me. All the dreams that I lived for have left me incomplete. Now I'm still searching, if I could find the truth. But these voices haunting me have left me so confused </segment3>
		<segment4>I cry out for you to hear. And I wonder does anybody care. You talk about Jesus, how He set you free. You talk about a Savior, how He died for me. I don't understand it, what you're talking about. All I feel is pain, please help me now </segment4>
		<segment5>When I was cold, did you let me in. When I was hungry, were you my friend. When I was down and out and I needed your hand. Did you see a chance or just a desperate man </segment5>
		<segment6>You talk about Jesus, how He set you free. You talk about a Savior, how He died for me. I don't understand it, what you're talking about. All I feel is pain, please help me now </segment6>
		<segment7>Oh you say we're equal, all men are brothers. But why are the rich more equal than others, Yeah more equal than others. Don't ask the answers, I've only got one, When a man leaves his darkness he follows the Son    </segment7>
