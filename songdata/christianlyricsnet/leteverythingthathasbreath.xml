		<segment1>CHORUS. Let everything, let everything that has breath praise the Lord. Let everything, let everything that has breath praise the Lord!</segment1>
		<segment2>VERSE. Praise him in his sanctuary, praise him in his mighty heavens. Praise him for his acts of power, praise him for surpassing greatness. Praise him with the sounding trumpet, praise him with the harp and lyre. Praise him; let all creation praise him!</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS</segment3>
		<segment4>Praise him with the tambourine, praise him, and dancing. Praise him with the strings, praise him with strings and flute. Praise him with the clash of cymbals, praise him, resounding cymbals praise him; let all creation praise him!</segment4>
		<segment5>Let everything, let everything that has breath praise the Lord!    </segment5>
