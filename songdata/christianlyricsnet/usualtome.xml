		<segment1>Desperate in the afternoon. Wanting just to meet with you for tea. Silence slowly fills the air. Hesitation is just a friend to me </segment1>
		<segment2>Life feels so usual to me. Life feels so usual to me </segment2>
		<segment3>But how am I the only one sinking like the sun?. Could I find myself in times of better days?. Am I the only one sinking like the sun?. Could I find someone? </segment3>
		<segment4>Useless in the afternoon. This has been going on for far too long. I don't want to feel this way. I think it's time that I should carry on </segment4>
		<segment5>But how am I the only one sinking like the sun?. Could I find myself in times of better days?. Am I the only one sinking like the sun?. Could I find myself in times of better days?. Better days, better days.     </segment5>
