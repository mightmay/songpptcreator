		<segment1>Throw your stones at silver screens. Faces on magazines. Burn my rock n roll. Blame my schools, my ADD. My mom, my MTV. Curse my chromosomes</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I'm what's wrong with. This world; I'm bent. Warped and wicked. I am weak. My heart's twisted. Torn and tempted. This world is not what's wrong with me. I'm what's wrong with this world. What's wrong with this world</segment2>
		<segment3>Put my finger in the chest. Of those who should know best. But made the worst of things. Baby booms and presidents. Boy bands and communists. Everyone but me. . I don't need your. Help to be this. Devilish and dark. I confessed I. Made this mess while. Using just my heart. Change my heart. My heart is</segment3>
		<segment4>Repeat Chorus: Change my heart God. Change my heart God. Change my heart yeah     </segment4>
