		<segment1>Side by side by side by side. Walking together is the way it should be. Side by side by side by side. When you're needing somebody. Depend upon me. We'll travel on this journey of life. Side by side. (repeat)</segment1>
		<segment2>Everyday of my life, every valley I face. I know you'll always be there every step that I take. Let's keep our eyes on the father above. I need you, you need me, we need love</segment2>
		<segment3>Side by side by side by side. Walking together is the way it should be. Side by side by side by side. When you're needing somebody. Depend upon me. We'll travel on this journey of life. Side by side</segment3>
		<segment4>No need to go by yourself find the way on your own. You're never out of his sight even when you're alone. All I'll stay closer then a brother to you. Arm in arm, hand in hand, two by two</segment4>
		<segment5>Side by side by side by side. Walking together is the way it should be. Side by side by side by side. When you're needing somebody. Depend upon me. We'll travel on this journey of life. Side by side. (repeat 2X)    </segment5>
