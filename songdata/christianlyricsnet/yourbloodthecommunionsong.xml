		<segment1>Ooowahhhh as far as the east is to the west, is as far as he placed my retched sins away from me, he paid a price that i can never pay, he died so i wasnt bound and live in victory,</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus:</segment2>
		<segment3>(ahhhh) thats why i thank you or your blood, (ahhh) thnk you for your blood, thnk you for the blood you shed for me on calvary, thats y i think u for your blood, thnk you for your blood, thnk you for your blood that washed my sin away, . Ike:  my lifes been stained enough by my own hands, time and time again i  fell following your plan still your blood covers all ive ever done, my past present and future sin all covered by the sun. For who the son sets free is truly free indeed</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus:</segment4>
