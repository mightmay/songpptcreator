		<segment1>Break my bones and reset me. Piece by piece you break me. Pick up the cross 'cause it's killing time. How can I scream when the pain is. Such a release I get the courage. To pick up the nails 'cause it's killing time</segment1>
		<segment2>Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on. Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on</segment2>
		<segment3>Breathing your love. You're ferocious. You're in my lungs. Resuscitate. Craving your electricity. Feet to my pain you give. Wings to my fear your peace. Inhabits my blood. Your love is thick</segment3>
		<segment4>Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on. Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on</segment4>
		<segment5>I can't live without it. I can't live without it. I can't live without it. I can't live without it</segment5>
		<segment6>Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on. Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on</segment6>
		<segment7>Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on. Kill me, heal me. Kill me, heal me. On and on    </segment7>
