		<segment1>Lord, You're beautiful. Your face is all I see. And when Your eyes. Are on this child. Your grace abounds to me. Lord, please light the fire. That once burned bright and clear. Replace the lamp of my first love. That burns with holy fear. Lord, You're beautiful. Your face is all I see. And when Your eyes. Are on this child</segment1>
		<segment2>Your grace abounds. Your grace abounds. Your grace abounds to me. Brrr, stick 'em. Haha, stick 'em, stick 'em. (repeat 6X)</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord, please light the fire. That once burned bright and clear. Replace the lamp of my first love. That burns, that burns. That burns with holy fear    </segment3>
