		<segment1>Will you like to watch the sunrise. Will you have blue or brown eyes. What are the dreams you long to share</segment1>
		<segment2>I hope you like Stevie Wonder. Are you afraid of thunder. I close my eyes and say a prayer your out there somewhere</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus: I've been waiting all my life for you. I've been wishing on every shining star. I've been watching out of my window. Wondering where you are Wondering where you are</segment3>
		<segment4>My heart's my only treasure. I've been saving it for your pleasure. I can't wait to give my heart to you</segment4>
		<segment5>We'll walk this road together. That leads us to forever. I close my eyes and say a prayer your out there somewhere</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Too many nights alone. And this house won't be a home until I'm with you</segment7>
		<segment8>I've been waiting all my life for you. I've been wishing on every shining star</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus</segment9>
		<segment10>Wondering where you are Wondering where you are. Wondering where you are Wondering where you are.     </segment10>
