		<segment1>I'm reaching out without a sound. My pride falls to the floor again. Inside my mind I search to find. A place just to call my own</segment1>
		<segment2>Deep inside your eyes. I am blinded by your love. Still I run so far just to find that. I'm alone again</segment2>
		<segment3>In my head. I hear you calling me. And I can't run cause there's nothing left for me. When I fall you always follow me deep inside. Deep inside. Deep inside of my head</segment3>
		<segment4>I just can't last as these feelings pass. Once again I hide the pain inside. The smile wears thin and the lies begin. To bring me down again</segment4>
		<segment5>When I run I run so far away from you. I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again. And all my faith I put in you. This time you take it all away </segment5>
		<segment6>Inside my head Deep inside My head    </segment6>
