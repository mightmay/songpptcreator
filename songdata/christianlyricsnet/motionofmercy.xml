		<segment1>I was poor I was weak. I was the definition of the spiritually. Bankrupt condition. So in need of help. I was unsatisfied. Hungry and thirsty. When You rushed to my side. So unworthy. Still You gave yourself away. That's the motion of mercy. Changing the way and the why we are. That's the motion of mercy. Moving my heart. Now I'm filled by a love. That calls me to action. I was empty before now I'm drawn to compassion. And to give myself away. Living for the lost. Loving 'til it hurts. No matter what the cost. Like You loved me first. That's the motion of mercy. God give me strength to give something for nothing. I wanna be a glimpse of the Kingdom that's coming soon    </segment1>
