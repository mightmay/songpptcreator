		<segment1>Last night as I slept I saw my life slip away. Then you were next to me. I couldn't see your face but I knew that it was you. Giving me a second chance. I'll never really understand why I cannot comprehend your love and grace. Why do I take pride in what I can't control. How can I claim what isn't really mine. What's the point to my ignorance?. The music that I see. The colors in the air. The breath in my lungs tonight. Why do I fight with you sometimes?. So today I walk down this road again. I understand now, some of what you said. Sometimes I lack the strength I need. But you come through, every time I fail you're there to pick me up, when I need it most. When I've fallen hard you're there no questions asked. You lift me up when I am down. Please open my eyes. Please help me understand.    </segment1>
