		<segment1>I'm in love, and I know that you are too, And you trust that I will come through for you, I will live my life, With your pure, sinless heart as my guide.</segment1>
		<segment2>Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh, oh oh.</segment2>
		<segment3>He didn't bleed forever, And death couldn't hold him down. He brought us back together, And we will share his crown.</segment3>
		<segment4>When in love nothing else will do, But the touch of the one who's heart beats for you. My mind's racing to the day, When we both say I do.</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh, oh oh.</segment5>
		<segment6>He didn't bleed forever, And death couldn't hold him down. He brought us back together, And we will share his crown.</segment6>
		<segment7>Make yourself known in all your glory. And steal our breath. Our eyes now open to the story, We've been made to live, we've been made to live.</segment7>
		<segment8>Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh, Oh oh, oh oh.</segment8>
		<segment9>He didn't bleed forever, And death couldn't hold him down. He brought us back together, And we will share his crown.     </segment9>
