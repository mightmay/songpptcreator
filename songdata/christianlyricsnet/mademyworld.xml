		<segment1>I never thought of what I could be. Where I'd go. What I'd do. I never thought of what I should be. Until You. You came into my life. When I was all alone. You came down. And saved my soul</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: When I found my world was crashing. And I thought I'd lost my passion. You came and laid a hand. On this little girl</segment2>
		<segment3>When I thought my dreams were fading. I looked up and saw You waiting. You reached Your hand down. And You made my world. I never thought of where I might be. If I turned away from You. I never thought of all I would need</segment3>
		<segment4>Without You. You came down. When I was all alone. You came down. You came down. And saved my soul    </segment4>
