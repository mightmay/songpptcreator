		<segment1>Waiting. How can someone so close. Be allowed to be so far away. Your red leaves fall in the evening. While I'm waking up to smog these days. You know how I love when the sun touch my skin. But I still miss your thoughts on rain. So come and save me over the thin phoneline</segment1>
		<segment2>Just one of those days. Where you learn to fly. With broken wings. My thoughts are on an airplane home. While the feet are still on the ground. Just one of those days. Where you learn to fly. With broken wings</segment2>
		<segment3>But you were never late. To pick up the phone and call. Now it's fall and I miss. Making love in the Sunday afternoon sunlight. Wednesday, Thursday. One down, billions to go. With glasses foggy you're losing sight. So come and I'll save you over this thin phoneline</segment3>
		<segment4>Just one of those days. Where you learn to fly. With broken wings. My thoughts are on an airplane home. While the feet are still on the ground. Just one of those days. Where you learn to fly. With broken wings.     </segment4>
