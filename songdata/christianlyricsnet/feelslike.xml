		<segment1> I fail in every single way. But every time I hear you say. 'Faithful one, come in to this place. the place of rest where you belong,'. I anticipate the final day when. I fall into your warm embrace, With everything that Ive been through. Nothing else compares</segment1>
		<segment2>[CHORUS]. And it feels like, All these tears are coming through, When I think of everything you do. And it feels like all this joy is bleeding through, When I think of seeing you</segment2>
		<segment3>I complicate this very state of resting in what you create, Nothing goes out your control, Youve given me this very soul, You cared enough to take my place, And have given me unending grace, I know that you know every need thats my security</segment3>
		<segment4>All your ways are so mysterious never far your ear to hear us. Ill never thirst from this drink that you give when you are near     </segment4>
