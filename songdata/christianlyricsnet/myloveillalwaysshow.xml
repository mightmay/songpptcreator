		<segment1>. [Verse 1]. You know I really love you. Your love is beautiful, lasting and true. I've searched for a true love for such a long, long time. Now, my search has ended, yes, cause you are mine. </segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. I'll always love you and I'll always tell you so. As long as I'm with you, my love I'll always show </segment2>
		<segment3>[Verse 2]. Whenever I'm sad and feeling real blue. I begin to feel happy as I sit and think of you. I think of your face and your personality. You are so beautiful, you mean everything to me. </segment3>
		<segment4>[Repeat Chorus]    </segment4>
