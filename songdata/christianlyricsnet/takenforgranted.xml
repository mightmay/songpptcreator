		<segment1>Slowing down, my actions become known to me. No way no how, could I have been so blind to see, what I've become. Take away, I never was meaning to do, and pleasing you, was all I ever wanted to. So break me down, that I might understand.</segment1>
		<segment2>I know you're looking down on me. and it must hurt to see all that you see, your love remains the same. Taken for granted, everything that you have given never again, I won? remain the same.</segment2>
		<segment3>One more chance, though given not always received. And growing numb, to guilt is often done with ease. My conscience says, what? left fades away.    </segment3>
