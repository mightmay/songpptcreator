		<segment1>Of modern man the melody of dysfunction is functional. Words that will race, could kill and disgrace you and I. Cause I was fearing nothing till this spilled from your lips. When they come running, When they come running out. Don't say whatever words come into your mind with two sides. So set aside your keys to the futures of these two and hold you tongue. Cause you don't fight there wars, the battles they face are not yours to overcome. They were fearing nothing till this spilled from your lips. Build it up to tear it down, promises to count upon. Will hold you to the tyranny. I'm trying just to understand, your bitter words they bind my hands. That long just to hold you.     </segment1>
