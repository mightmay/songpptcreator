		<segment1>I set out on a narrow way many years ago. Hoping I would find true love. Along the broken road. But I got lost a time or two. I wiped my brow and kept pushing through. I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to You</segment1>
		<segment2>That every long lost dream. Led me to where You are. Others who broke my heart. They were like northern stars. Pointing me on my way. Into Your loving arms. This much I know is true. That God blessed the broken road. That led me straight to You</segment2>
		<segment3>I think about the years I spent just passing through. I'd like to have the time I lost. And give it back to you. But You just smile and take my hand. You've been there and You understand. It's all part of a grander plan. That is coming true</segment3>
		<segment4>That every long lost dream. Led me to where You are. Others who broke my heart. They were like northern stars. Pointing me on my way. Into Your loving arms. This much I know is true. That God blessed the broken road. That led me straight to You</segment4>
		<segment5>Now i'm just rolling home into my lover's arms. This much I know is true. That God blessed the broken road. That led me straight to You    </segment5>
