		<segment1>Hear the call of the kingdom. Lift your eyes to the King. Let His song rise within you. As a fragrant offering. Of how God rich in mercy. Came in Christ to redeem. All who trust in His unfailing grace</segment1>
		<segment2>Hear the call of the Kingdom. To be children of light. With the mercy of heaven. The humility of Christ. Walking justly before Him. Loving all that is right. That the life of Christ may shine through us</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). King of Heaven we will answer the call. We will follow bringing hope to the world. Filled with passion, filled with power to proclaim. Salvation in Jesus' name</segment3>
		<segment4>Hear the call of the Kingdom. To reach out to the lost. With the Father's compassion. In the wonder of the cross. Bringing peace and forgiveness. And a hope yet to come. Let the nations put their trust in Him    </segment4>
