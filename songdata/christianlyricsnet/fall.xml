		<segment1>I give up i surrender,i throw in the town. Exposing my weakness to infinite power. with all of my weight, i lean heavy on you. with bags on my back,and in both my hands too	</segment1>
		<segment2>chorus. I fall, I fall on you. I fall, I fall on you </segment2>
		<segment3>See my world keeps on spinning,out of control. And am dizzy from trying,to stand on my own. But you promised to catch me ,if i tumbled down </segment3>
		<segment4>'Cause the way to the sky,starts low to the ground </segment4>
		<segment5>chorus. And i fall, fall on you. I fall, I fall on you </segment5>
		<segment6>bridge. please dont move,please dont move,please dont move, From here, from here(4 times) </segment6>
		<segment7>chorus and bridge together    </segment7>
