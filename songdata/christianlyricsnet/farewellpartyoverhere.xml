		<segment1>I'm telling myself so I'll know. I speak to my heart like a daughter. Someties it's hard to let go. Sometimes the staying is harder. So farewell broken heart. This is where we must part. Fare the well cloudy days. Moods of Blue, Shades of Gray. I thought I heard love loud and clear. It said it would be mine if only. I learn to let go of my fear. And cradle the hope of what could be. So Farewell broken heart. This is where we must part. Fare thee well cloudy days. Moods of blue, shades of gray. Rain go away, Don't come again another day. So farewell broken heart. This is where we must part. Fare thee well cloudy days. Moods of blue, shades of gray. This is where we must part. Fare thee well cloudy days. Moods of blue, shades of gray. i'm telling my self so i'll know    </segment1>
