		<segment1>Where am I. Someone please turn on the lights. Im not fine Im not fine. How can I find my way from this little cellar they call life</segment1>
		<segment2>Down here I tear out my veins and tie them to the chair. This goes on and on and on. Unravelled in contortions I run for the door. This goes on and on and on</segment2>
		<segment3>Hold on, hold on, hold on to my own destruction. I fall face first, I fall face first. Watch me descend Im on display. This cycle of human decay</segment3>
		<segment4>I feel it lurking in the corners. I watch it tracking up my arm</segment4>
		<segment5>I am the anchor. I am the anchor. I am the anchor. Bound to my existence. Bound to my existence</segment5>
		<segment6>I make peace with the parasites I live among. Paralyzed I watch them colonize as I sit here and just fall apart</segment6>
		<segment7>The beggars and choosers are all the same. The default reaction will never change. So I catch a glimpse of my own reflection. From a shard of glass left on the floor</segment7>
		<segment8>The beggars and choosers are all the same. The default reaction will never change</segment8>
		<segment9>Its time to restart. Reassemble whats left of my body. Its time to restart. Pick me up and walk away</segment9>
		<segment10>Uproot the anchor. Uproot the anchor. Uproot the anchor. Uproot the anchor</segment10>
		<segment11>Walk right out the door</segment11>
		<segment12>Ill change for the better. It cant get much worse. Ill swallow my own pride. And then accept defeat</segment12>
		<segment13>Accept defeat. Accept defeat    </segment13>
