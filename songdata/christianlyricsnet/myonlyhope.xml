		<segment1>The silence of whats left is waking me, I never sleep. And what was here before is fading fast. And now its gone away, away </segment1>
		<segment2>So I can pray this all will end. Take it a million miles away. I cant go through this again. Youre my only hope </segment2>
		<segment3>The deepest parts of me are crying out for something more. Blind reality has lead me here. Have I thrown it all away, away.     </segment3>
