		<segment1>Power thunder, lightning bolts. Rushing wind, a waterfall. Babies' cry, a mother's tears. Humming river, rustling leaves</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: He's calling loud and clearly. He's saying &quot;Won't you hear Me&quot;. We see Him everywhere. And still we roll on by</segment2>
		<segment3>Winter snow, a fire's warmth. Summer's day a cold heart turns. Peaceful place, a helping hand. Kindly words, a smiling face</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>He was God but one of us. A king who had a servants heart. Born to die so we might live. His reason was His Father's will</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>Power thunder, lightning bolts. Rushing wind, a waterfall. Winter snow, a fire's warmth. Summer's day a cold heart turns    </segment7>
