		<segment1>Hey June, I can't believe. you going away again this fall. Hey June I can't take much more of this at all. Cause life was meant to be so much more than you are.. Hey June, I didn't hear you come in late again last night. Hey June, I can't smell his cologne on you. Hey June, Are you gonna stay out late again tonight. Cause life was meant to be so much more than you are.. Here she comes again, she comes and goes.    </segment1>
