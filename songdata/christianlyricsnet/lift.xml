		<segment1>count them, every one. all of things you've done. you are the lord of my life. and I roll them over and over. in my head, in my head. but I don't understand. but I'm glad you're in my life. and I lift you up so high. I forget about the world I'm living in. lay it at your feet. I'm giving in. my joy inside. I cannot hide. I love to lift you up. lord I love you. you're a father's hand at night. you're the sunshine in the day. and I long to be with you. all my days. in old age if I'm still hanging around. I'll be found around with you. and I lift you up so high. I love to lift you up.     </segment1>
