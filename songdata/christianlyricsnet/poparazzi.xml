		<segment1>Tune for the poparazzi. Tune for the poparazzi </segment1>
		<segment2>This is a tune for the poparazzi. The who's who and the so and so's. This is a tune for the graven images of Marilyn Monroe </segment2>
		<segment3>We saw your face on the magazine. We heard the song on the MP3 </segment3>
		<segment4>You're stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. You can close your ears and your eyes. But Pop will never leave you alone </segment4>
		<segment5>Leave me alone with your social mingle. You try so hard to stay on top. Leave me alone with your little jingle. With your picture perfect pop </segment5>
		<segment6>We read the article in Seventeen. We saw the video on MTv </segment6>
		<segment7>You're stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. You can close your ears and your eyes. But Pop will never leave you alone </segment7>
		<segment8>This is a tune for the last Nirvana. The teen spirit rock-and-roll. This is a tune for the velvet Elvis's. On the 90210 </segment8>
		<segment9>I thought my eyes were gonna get off clean. 'Til I read your lips on the TV screen. You were busy saying what you didn't mean. Now everyone's singing along. With your ridiculous song. You got it stuck. You got it stuck in my head </segment9>
		<segment10>Stuck in my head. Stuck in my head. You can close your ears and your eyes. You can close your ears and your eyes. But Pop will never leave you alone </segment10>
		<segment11>Tune for the Poparazzi    </segment11>
