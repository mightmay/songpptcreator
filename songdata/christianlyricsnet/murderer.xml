		<segment1>Waiting in a corner standing. Playing out the best case. Your pleasure is nearing.</segment1>
		<segment2>Hunt them. Get away. Hurt them.</segment2>
		<segment3>In a moment madness reeling. Theres no one watching now, the innocence dying.</segment3>
		<segment4>Hunt them. Get away. Hurt them.</segment4>
		<segment5>Nothing Breathes inside.. Nothing Lives inside..</segment5>
		<segment6>Sickening cries call out. Begging to be released, only to find, theyre falling on deaf ears.</segment6>
		<segment7>Hunt them. Get away. Hurt them.</segment7>
		<segment8>Nothing Breathes inside.. Nothing Lives inside..(x 2)    </segment8>
