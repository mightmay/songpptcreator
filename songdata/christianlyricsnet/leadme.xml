		<segment1>I will walk these streets alone. On this story i've been told. I know what people say. I've watched it growing old. I'm bitter and I'm cold</segment1>
		<segment2>I will always understand. When you take me by the hand. Words are mystery. But everything I know. Is never let it go</segment2>
		<segment3>Won't someone lead me. Won't someone take me. Won't someone feed me. It's lonely as I call</segment3>
		<segment4>Moving on again. A little less to spend. I know there's more to me. I try to make it real. I'm living what I feel</segment4>
		<segment5>When I'm sinking. I sell my fortune in. Find a way out. I pawn my soul again     </segment5>
