		<segment1>Oh, we need to see You. Oh, live within us</segment1>
		<segment2>I fear the eyes of man are dim and blind. To Your love Id lose my life to gain a look inside Your perfect heart. I feel so overwhelmed tonight. I need Your love to break through</segment2>
		<segment3>Spirit of Love, wont You come. And fall on everyone. The world must know that we are Yours. Our hearts beat as one. To see Your kingdom come. So pour out all Your love. Oh, reign in us</segment3>
		<segment4>Deep within my soul there is a war. For whats right. I need a glimpse of truth worth dying for. To win this fight. I feel so overwhelmed inside. With Your love Ill break through    </segment4>
