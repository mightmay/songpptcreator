		<segment1>We have nothing to give. That didn't first come from Your hands. We have nothing to offer You. Which You did not provide. Every good, perfect gift comes from. Your kind and gracious heart. And all we do is give back to You. What always has been Yours</segment1>
		<segment2>Lord, we're breathing the breath. That You gave us to breath. To worship You, to worship You. And we're singing these songs. With the very same breath. To worship You, to worship You</segment2>
		<segment3>Who has given to You. That it should be paid back to him?. Who has given to You. As if You needed anything?. From You, and to You, and through You. Come all things, O Lord. And all we do is give back to You. What always has been Yours</segment3>
		<segment4>We are breathing the breath. That You gave us to breath    </segment4>
