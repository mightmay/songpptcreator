		<segment1>I felt like I was spinning. . Didn't know what was up from down. . I tried to fix what I had broken. . It was scattered all around. . . It seems that every time I try walking by myself, . I end up on my face with nowhere else to go. . So I surrender all my ways. . . Take all of these impurities. . I'm giving you this wretched soul. . I'm giving you these insecurities.. . Giving You All Control. . . I'm placing both my feet on the floor . Making sure I won't make that mistake anymore. . I've tasted all the emptiness around me, . And I'm never going back. . . I'd set myself up for the lies that this world satisfies, . But you're all that I need. . And I have peace inside . So keep tearing out all of my pride. . . Take all of these impurities. . I'm giving you this wretched soul. . I'm giving you these insecurities.. . Giving you all control. . . I'm taking all my fears and layin' em at your feet now. . I'm resting in the fact that everything is safe now, . When I let go of all the things I know will fade out. . Every word that you have said I know I'll never doubt.      </segment1>
