		<segment1>Death of the spirit. Enabling the flesh to swallow the mind. They're submitting to their sins. Bodies full of darkness and eyes that fail the light. The decay of the spirit inside. Life left living in deception. A sickening life they're living. It's inflicting their minds. A sickening life they're living. Because they're dead inside. Like the beasts that perish. Destined for the grave. Death will feed on them. In their tombs they will remain. So lead Christ unto them. And shed their calluses    </segment1>
