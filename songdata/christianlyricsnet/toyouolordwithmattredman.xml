		<segment1>To You O Lord I lift up my soul. In you I trust O my God. Do not let me be put to shame. Nor let my enemies triumph over me</segment1>
		<segment2>No one whose hope is in you. Will ever be put to shame. That's why my eyes are on you Oh Lord. Surround me, defend me. Oh how I need you. To you I lift up my soul. To you I lift up my soul</segment2>
		<segment3>Show me your ways and teach me your paths. Guide me in truth lead me on. For you're my God, you are my Saviour. My hope is in you each moment of the day</segment3>
		<segment4>Remember Lord your mercy and love. That ever flow from of old. Remember not the sins of my youth. Or my rebellious ways. According to your love remember me. According to your love. For you are good O Lord</segment4>
