		<segment2>Who is this King of angels, O blessed Prince of Peace. Revealing things of Heaven and all its mysteries. My spirits ever longing for His grace in which to stand. Who's this King of glory, Son of God and son of man</segment2>
		<segment3>His name is Jesus, precious Jesus. The Lord Almighty, the King of my heart. The King of glory</segment3>
		<segment4>Who is this King of Glory with strength and majesty. And wisdom beyond measure, the graceous King of kings. the Lord of Earth and Heaven, the Creator of all things. Who is this King of Glory, He's everything to me</segment4>
