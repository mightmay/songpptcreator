		<segment1>Rain is a bad reminder of everything I don't want to know. Rain is a backseat driver that takes me where I don't want to go </segment1>
		<segment2>And it looks like the sky is caving in again. I'm dry and cracked, the sky goes black. And tut, tut, it looks like rain </segment2>
		<segment3>Erosion. Oh, Spirit, fall like rain on my thirsty soul. Erosion. Oh, sweet erosion, break me and make me whole </segment3>
		<segment4>The thirstiest grounds can't take the rain. My undecided vices washing on down the drain. And it looks like the sky is caving in again. My heart is cracked, the sky goes black. And tut, tut it looks like rain. Erosion. Oh, Spirit, fall like rain on my thirsty soul. Erosion. Oh, sweet erosion, break me and make me whole </segment4>
		<segment5>Oh, Erosion, would You wash away my sins?. Oh, Erosion, I need a second shot again. Oh, Erosion, would You break my heart again?. Oh, Erosion, I am a broken-hearted man </segment5>
		<segment6>Erosion. Oh, Spirit, fall like rain on my thirsty soul. Erosion. Oh, sweet erosion, break me and make whole </segment6>
		<segment7>Erosion. Oh, Spirit, fall on my thirsty soul. Erosion. Oh, sweet erosion, break me and make me whole    </segment7>
