		<segment1>She was a lovely girl, a charming brown-eyed beauty. You were the bright young man who swept her off her feet. The high school class ring soon became a wedding band. And you went off the sail the seas for Uncle Sam. But they say it was the demon in the bottle. That took you far away never to return. And you never knew you son would be my father. And now sometimes I think about you and I wonder. If I could talk to you what words would I choose</segment1>
		<segment2>I would say I wish I could have know you. And I would say I wish you would have stayed. But most of all I would say I forgive you</segment2>
		<segment3>I know your love was strong I read it in your letters. I read how hard you tried to break free from the chains. I know we all could say how you should have done better. And wear our anger and resentment like a fetter. But that's why I would say this to you if I could</segment3>
		<segment4>I would say I wish I could have know you. And I would say I wish you would have stayed. But most of all I would say I forgive you</segment4>
		<segment5>I'd love to tell you how the lovely girl you married. She's been my hero and a treasure to us all. I know you'd be proud of the way your name's been carried. These are things I would love to tell you if I could</segment5>
		<segment6>I would say I wish I could have know you. And I would say I wish you would have stayed. But most of all I would say I forgive you</segment6>
		<segment7>I wish you were here to hear what I would say     </segment7>
