		<segment1>(Verse 1)</segment1>
		<segment2>I woke up at six a.m., and took a look at me. All I was, all I am, I refuse to be. Within a simple breath, I taste my destiny. Before I lose what's left, I want my heart to see</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>Love is why I live, Love is why I die. It's what I give, and yet what I deny. It's what I need, it's how I will survive. Love Is Why</segment4>
		<segment5>(Verse 2)</segment5>
		<segment6>I can read, I can write, but still I'm deaf and blind. All the things I've discerned, I've given up to find. The only thing that sets me free is a mystery. Worth more than anything, throughout my history</segment6>
		<segment7>(Chorus)</segment7>
		<segment8>(Bridge)</segment8>
		<segment9>Love is patient, Love is Kind, Love - it has no pride. Love will wait forever, Love won't hide. Love is patient, Love is Kind, Love - it has no pride. Love will wait forever, Love won't hide</segment9>
		<segment10>(Chorus)    </segment10>
