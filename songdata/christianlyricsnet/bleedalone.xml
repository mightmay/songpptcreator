		<segment1>Selfishness has brought me to this place. Unreal desires have slit the throat of happiness. holding on to the memories. That will never be again. Breaking the sacred vow. Taken a thousand times. Lies through the mouth. Of the one who believes. Wears the mask. To cover all of the emptiness inside. I bleed alone. My eyes fail me. I sink. Can't swim. I'm drowning. Can't stay on top. Can't move. I'm falling further away from you. I'm only suffering. Because the focus is gone. I bleed alone. My eyes fail me. I sink. Can't swim. I'm drowning. Can't stay on top. Can't move. I'm falling further away from you. I'm only suffering. Because the focus is gone. Selfishness has brought me to this place. Unreal desires slit the throat of happiness. Holding on to the memories. That will never be again </segment1>
