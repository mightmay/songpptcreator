		<segment1>You came to the world. For Love of one Like Me. And Though I am the worst of sinners. Grace is all I see. Freedom from these chains. My brokenness redeemed. Love and Mercy flowing down. To life eternally. How could I repay such a debt. Except with my life. How could I give anything but sacrifice. Sacrifice of praise </segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: To the King Eternal, immortal. Be all the glory forever Amen. To the King Eternal, immortal. Be all the glory forever Amen </segment2>
		<segment3>In plenty and want. Your strength is all I need. And deep within these shadow lands. Your glory never leaves </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus: My Praise will go on and on and on. My Praise will go on and on and on. My Praise will go on and on </segment4>
		<segment5>. Oh my Praise will go on </segment5>
		<segment6>Oh my Praise will go on and on and on. My Praise will go on and on. My Praise will go on and on </segment6>
		<segment7>Oh and on and on and on and on and on. And on and on and on </segment7>
		<segment8>To the King eternal, immortal. Be all the glory forever Amen </segment8>
		<segment9>To the King eternal, immortal. Be all the glory forever Amen </segment9>
		<segment10>To the King eternal, immortal. Be all the glory forever Amen </segment10>
		<segment11>To the King eternal, immortal. Be all the glory forever Amen </segment11>
		<segment12>I'm giving all of me. This is my offering    </segment12>
