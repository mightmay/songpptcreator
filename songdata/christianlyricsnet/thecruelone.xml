		<segment1>Flying over the counter. Broken glasses on the floor. The smell of fear and two toned hair. And a smoke trail out the door. Counting back from a hundred. And they moved the show outside. Back and forth, and front to back. To seek the ones that hide. They don't want to be found!</segment1>
		<segment2>They're running from Cruella Deville. They don't know she is the mob, she runs this town. She's all evil and she's dying to kill. You don't know</segment2>
		<segment3>Sergeant Tibbs, can you hear us?. Hear the howling on the wind?. Everybody's nervous here and anxious to begin. There's a spark at the curtains taking our last place to hide. Tell all the kids on the playground to get on their bikes and ride, and ride, and ride!!</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh, lest she find you. Oh, she is right behind you!     </segment4>
