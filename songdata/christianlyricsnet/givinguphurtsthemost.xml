		<segment1>angels mourn crying, praying for your soul. as my eyes open from their state of sleep i feel my blood. turn into a frozen river. nightmares so close death was in the air. my heart locked shut, and i gave you the key. promise never to leave. as lies hold me emptiness fills my broken heart. screaming your name hoping for a response, silence summer. drowned by winter. to look in your face and realized the time we spent the chances i. had have drifted away from my fingertips. your life, your thoughts, your dreams, your love. never tried my hardest and now i cray as the hurt enters. i love you and i still love you. even though i never showed it. a piece of me is gone forever. clutching memories held so close. repeating words of love spoken to late. my eyes look all around but all they can focus on is you. for in you i find me. days past by and thy death still lingers. this coldness will never satisfy me. i want to be surrounded by angels in a place. where the sun is so warm it burns my insides. surrounded by angels. where love takes my darkest depressions. and throws it into the deepest of sea. a place i can call home, i'm crying to you Jesus. mend me, break me, make me. you're all i've got now. my eyes look all around but all they can focus on is you. for in you i find me. farewell my friend your time has come. and never will i be able to tell you i love you again    </segment1>
