		<segment1>You opened up my ears to hear. The imperfections of my heroes. And those I held up to the sun. Are cracked and broken, every one. They spoke words of fire They held my desire. But just because they look like you. Doesn't mean they honour you no no</segment1>
		<segment2>But now my eyes are open. And I will only hope in you you you. You're the only hero You're the only one who will never let me down. You'll never let me down</segment2>
		<segment3>How could flesh and blook begin To lift me up out of my sin?. Yet you became the very thing I looked for in earthly kings. I was longing for you Though I did not know you. I thought I would hear your voice If I made the same noise. There has always only been you Bright shining as the sun    </segment3>
