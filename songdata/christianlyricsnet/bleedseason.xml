		<segment1>Trace the chalk and seize the day so. Those old habits never pass away. Commemerate the conception with. The children's debt the retribution. Deaf to self and mute to mind to find muddled wallowing nebulous blind. My crippled confidence chafed away. Without the answers I'm cast astray. My cloud's so thick that I can barely think. so reveal to me deadsight deadsight. Trace the tree and the veil will flee me. And now I see with salty eyes. Consistent tragedy persisting in me. This disability's my soul's demise. Deaf to self and left to fry. Muddled wallowing nebulous blind. My crippled confidence is chafed away to stay. With the answers I'm pulled astray. The habits laced embrace me. With a cold, chaotic flinch kiss of old deaths erase me soft, subtle, inch by inch. Upon my face I lie Mesmerized cauterized by the blemishes. Frail bandages Without chance to change. Desperate to rectify imperitive lest to die. Imminent reality on pace downglanced closed-faced. Consistent entrancement staring into empty space. with an open wound to clean. please cleanse me. Is this my time to feel. Is this my time to breathe. Is this my time to bleed. Change the season. I'll never live without you. I'll never see without you. I'll never change without you truesight    </segment1>
