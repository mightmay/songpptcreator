		<segment1>I know you. I know you doubt what I am saying. You think that I've been deceived. To follow after what some call a weak man's haven. It seems so simple that it's hard to believe</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). I can't understand why you would walk away from love. No I don't understand why you would walk away from love. Just can't understand why you would walk away from love. I'll never understand why you would walk away from love</segment2>
		<segment3>Maybe I'm right and He's waiting at the table. Maybe it happened when I saw it was my sin. Maybe He's waiting for a chance to show you true love. Maybe you'll never get this chance again</segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm a fool, so are you. I'm a fool, so are you. Maybe you think I'm a fool for what I'm saying. Maybe that's what I'd like to be. Or maybe you're a fool to say you're a wise man. Either way you lose unless you meet with my King</segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus 2x)    </segment6>
