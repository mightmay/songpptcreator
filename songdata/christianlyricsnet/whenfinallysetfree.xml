		<segment1>Feel the pain teaching us how much more we can take, reminding us how far we've come. Let the pain burn away from our hearts. We have time to start all over again. If you will shine your love down here. And make our hearts as perfect as new. If you would shine your love down here. I promise I'll reflect it right back at you.    </segment1>
