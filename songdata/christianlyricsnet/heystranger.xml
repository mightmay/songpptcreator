		<segment1>So, where does my life been?. Time, well has it passed me by?. Look in my eyes, look in my eyes. Tell me now. Decide, what do you want?</segment1>
		<segment2>People are strange in other world. And with their hands against the wind. They lift their chins and hands they use. And with their eyes they're asking you</segment2>
		<segment3>And I, am running on the inside. And you, you don't seem to care. (you don't seem to care). I guess I'll spend some time. Guess I'll spend some time. Time alone. But what, do I have to show?</segment3>
		<segment4>People are strange in other world. And with their hands against the wind. They lift their chins and hands they use. And with their eyes they're asking you</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't erase my life, don't erase my life. Don't erase my life, don't erase my life. (I'll do anything worth saving myself)</segment5>
		<segment6>People are strange in other world. And with their hands against the wind. They lift their chins and hands they use. And with their eyes they're asking you    </segment6>
