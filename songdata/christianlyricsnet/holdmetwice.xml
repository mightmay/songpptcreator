		<segment1>I saw you in the hallway, I bet thats what they all say, you probably didnt even notice i was the loser, who was starin at my shoes 'n', couldnt think of nothing to say. I'm on the runway, of a flight thats going one way, on &quot;corss your finger&quot; airlines. I'm picking up the pace, no frontin', getting nervous in the worst way, here goes nothing</segment1>
		<segment2>I saw her walkin over, now that shes slowly movin closer, wrote her a letter 'bout a week ago 'n', to my suprise. she replied and said:</segment2>
		<segment3>You can hold me once, You can hold me twice, even better if the stars are good tonight. You can hold me, be my one and only, this is the reply to the letter you wrote me.</segment3>
		<segment4>You told me to meet you after gym class, but i forgot to get a hall pass, and got sent to the office. You tried to call me, asked everyone around who saw me, they didnt even notice. You're on your way now, movin' with your parents to some hick town, a thousand miles away. I'm in the playground, and there's so much i could say now, I still remember when.</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>I'ts been awhile since we said &quot;hi&quot;, three hundred and sixty five days have gone by now, and i could paint of picture of you. I see you everytime i pass your locker, remember the time we talked 'till six a.m. and im tired of missing you    </segment6>
