		<segment1>This is where the water becomes shallow. And nothing here is quite as deep. as you hoped it would be.</segment1>
		<segment2>You wish the lines were drawn a little clearer. The tides have turned. this drought will burn. and everything is falling out of place.</segment2>
		<segment3>And drying in the sun. shriveling and shrinking. the hides are turning brown. wrinkling and stinging.</segment3>
		<segment4>as you bury yourself</segment4>
		<segment5>deep in the dust. of the sandiest grave you can find. it's a new desert life.</segment5>
		<segment6>to be reborn again. out of glass and of sand. and you're shimmering and you are clear.</segment6>
		<segment7>this is where. the water is shallow and nothing is as deep. as you hoped it would be.</segment7>
		<segment8>and this drought will burn. and everything's falling. out of place.</segment8>
		<segment9>and you're glimmering and you are clear.    </segment9>
