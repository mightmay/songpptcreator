		<segment1>Stop this, you're never going to find it. When you complicate, you are left behind but. Longing, steals away the night. And steps away from eyes that are always searching. This time, you can feel his voice. And He's never going to stop until it sinks in deeply. Falling, consecrated lies. And you're letting go with time cause you're through with keeping</segment1>
		<segment2>It's so real, never gonna stop till you want it, Want it. It's so real, never gonna stop</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). Cause we're moving with a symmetry. And we're crashing like the waves in the sea. And we're moving to your heart this time. Release </segment3>
		<segment4>Crashing, feel the way we move. Open up your eyes to the things around you. Haunting, take away the tears. Cause you know that your heart is so close to. Beating. This time, you can feel his voice. And He's never gonna stop until it sinks in deeply. Falling, consecrated lies. And you're letting go with time cause you're through with keeping</segment4>
		<segment5>It's so real. You are, you are. 2    </segment5>
