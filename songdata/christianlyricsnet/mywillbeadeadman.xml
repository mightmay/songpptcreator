		<segment1>High noon cometh, not a moment too soon. There's gonna be a firefight tonight. A reckoning to confront the residents of the tomb. A gunpowder party and it feels just right. There comes a time. There comes a day. There comes an hour when.. </segment1>
		<segment2>In every man's life. In every man's life. When he must.. Brandish his steel. Mount up his steed </segment2>
		<segment3>In every man's life. In every man's life. My will be a dead man </segment3>
		<segment4>Hushed </segment4>
		<segment5>All is quiet in the dusty alleyways. Few men dare to penetrate this land. And live to tell this terrible tale. My trusty six shot, my own right hand. There comes a day. There comes a time. There comes an hour when.. </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm not talking 'bout killing a man. I'm not referring to dirt, this land. There's no showdown here besides the one. That's erupting inside my head </segment6>
		<segment7>My will be a dead man.     </segment7>
