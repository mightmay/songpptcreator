		<segment1>If seeing is believing then they've gouged out all their own eyes. they're confused by the love, the hate, all of the hypocritical lies. their own misfortunes, creating the selfish disguise;. that will seed the beginning of their spiritual demise (2)</segment1>
		<segment2>I cant believe this is happening, my faith depleting somewhere buried inside, alive;. afraid, unstable, but learning that these things will clear in time. Im so scared, Im so scared of what I might become</segment2>
		<segment3>straying from the beaten path that Ive been on for so long. finally moving forward in life, acknowledging my faults. thats haunted my every move for what seems like years. my conscience screaming, realizing things arent as bad as they appear</segment3>
		<segment4>still anchored in our old ways</segment4>
		<segment5>and just when you think everything's going to be alright. defenses down, so vulnerable to what once had you gripped so tight </segment5>
		<segment6>the miracle I needed, no longer mistreated. the life changing motivation, my only inspiration. calm the storms and ill walk the waves. my eyes are open, and I can clearly see</segment6>
		<segment7>CALM THE STORMS AND ILL WALK THE WAVES</segment7>
		<segment8>I cant believe all this is happening to me, my faith depleting some where buried alive, inside;. afraid, unstable, but learning that these things will clear in time. Im so scared, Im so scared of what I might become. and just when you think everything s going to be alright. Im vulnerable to what once had me gripped so tight    </segment8>
