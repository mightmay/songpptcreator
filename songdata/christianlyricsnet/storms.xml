		<segment1>I feel like I'm caught in the middle of a hurricane. Standing in the eye of the storm. The waters deepening and the waves are crashing in. And I, I'm losing, I'm losing my way home</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. But I will not fear. When the storms of life appear. Cause Your holding me holding me tight. Your keeping me alive. When the storms of life arise. And Your helping me helping me to fight through the night</segment2>
		<segment3>When life is not what I thought that it would be. The pain is sometimes more than I can stand. And I have had to learn a lot the hard way. But I'm trusting that my life is in Your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. But I will not fear. When the storms of life appear. Cause Your holding me holding me tight. Your keeping me alive. When the storms of life arise. And Your helping me helping me to fight through the night</segment4>
		<segment5>And Your holding me holding me. And Your finding me finding me. And Your guiding me guiding me. Through the night</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus. I will not fear. When the storms of life appear. Cause Your holding me holding me tight. Your keeping me alive. When the storms of life arise. And Your helping me helping me to fight through the night.     </segment6>
