		<segment1>You're arriving with the sound of thunder and rain. You're arriving in the calm of the wind and the waves. You're arriving in the glow of a burning flame. A burning flame </segment1>
		<segment2>Praise awaits You at the dawn when the world come alive. Praise awaits You in the darkness and shines in the light. Praise awaits You with a song of love and desire, love and desire </segment2>
		<segment3>Here comes the King. All bow down. Lift up your voices. Unto the Lamb. He is the King. All bow down. All bow down </segment3>
		<segment4>You are coming again like a thief in the night. You are coming again with a shout from the sky. You are coming again to take away Your bride. To take away Your bride </segment4>
		<segment5>Yeah, You are the King </segment5>
		<segment6>You are the King. All bow down. We lift up our voices. Unto the Lamb. You are the King     </segment6>
