		<segment1>She holds his hand and stares off into space. All she knows now is how much things can change. It's not her fault. It's not her, no one is to blame. It's just that regret has a way of taunting you. I guess it's hard to hide the past, the way she struggles to make it last. I wanna share all I have with you. Would it change a thing if I was with you?. A broken heart, too much has passed. I hope someday that something lasts. Her head hangs low, a tear is in her eye. It's not the first time someone has made her cry. Up goes a wall that no one can climb. The only way in or out is through the heart. Take your time, don't you rush a thing. I'll be there waiting for you, never let you down again. I wanna share all I have with you. Would it change a thing if I was with you?. A broken heart, too much has passed. I hope someday that something lasts.    </segment1>
