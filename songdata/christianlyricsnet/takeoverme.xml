		<segment1>Must be tiring to meet my resistance. My stubborn will can be so twisted. Pride can steal the best from me. But its not what I want. But Youre what I need. So I surrender</segment1>
		<segment2>I want You. To take over me. I want You. To take over me. I dont wanna be part of the resistance. I wanna be part of the release. So I want You to take over me</segment2>
		<segment3>Oh, I cant survive a state of existence. Struggling to find whats missin. I wanna win the war between these skin and bones. And whats underneath. So I surrender. Yeah, I surrender</segment3>
		<segment4>I want You. To take over me. I want You. To take over me. I dont wanna be part of the resistance. I wanna be part of the release. So I want You to take over me, yeah</segment4>
		<segment5>Never want to, never wanna be against You. Never meant to, never meant to resist You. I never want to, never want to be against You, against You. Oh, how could I resist You?!</segment5>
		<segment6>So I want You. To take over me. I want You. To take over me. I dont wanna be part of the resistance. I wanna be part of the release. So I want You to take over me, yeah    </segment6>
