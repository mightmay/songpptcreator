		<segment1>I've run my ship aground. on the rocks of the soul. There's no lie like independence. there's no demon like control. I've fanned the burning embers. til my house was on fire. There's no parody like power. There's no fever like desire. I've drained the wine of darkness. to the dregs of deceit. There's no drug as strong as pride. There's no blindness like conceit. I've railed against the mountain. With a pickaxe and a file. There's no minefield like presumption. There's no death wish like denial</segment1>
		<segment2>There's no gunshot like conviction. There's no conscience bulletproof. There's no strength like utter weakness. There's no insult like the truth</segment2>
		<segment3>I've adjusted my prescription. til I couldn't trust my vision. there's no killer like convenience. there's no sickness like omission. I've amended resolutions and resisted explanation. There's no trap door like emotion. There's no pit like reputation</segment3>
		<segment4>There's no cancer like ambition. There's no cure like crucifixion.     </segment4>
