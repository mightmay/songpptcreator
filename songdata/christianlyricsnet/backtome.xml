		<segment1>Tears burn like the flame of the fire. Words heart when they come from an empty heart. Then time stops like the hand of a broken clock. And everything that lit up your life is covered in the darkness. I know, I know. I feel your pain. I know, I know</segment1>
		<segment2>When the world is closing in, you're breaking down. You're crying out but there is no answer. When you call, just close your eyes and know that. This twisted road eventually, is gonna lead you back to Me</segment2>
		<segment3>Ice melts to reveal a frozen soul. And the water rises to new suffocating heights. And it feels like you're drowning in desperation. Cause everything that lit up your life has been covered in the darkness. I know I know. I feel your pain</segment3>
		<segment4>I know I know, you know the way</segment4>
		<segment5>When the world is closing in, you're breaking down. You're crying out but there is no answer. When you call, just close your eyes and know that. This twisted road eventually, is gonna lead you back to Me    </segment5>
