		<segment1>I am yours and you are Mine</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Won't you say once more &quot;I love you&quot;. In the bread and in the wine. Till the whole world knows our love song. &quot;I am yours and you are Mine?&quot;. On the street it's hard to find; In the city, peace of mind ain't. Knocking on nobody's door, and even the. Countryside can't hide it anymore. People moving in every direction. Can't take a moment to be kind. For lack of understanding. The pace is too demanding. You could easily lose your mind. And He's saying to you</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>Standing under neon lights. Or lying down to troubled nights. Avoiding the most painful sights. There's no way to deny it. No matter if you're young or old. No matter if your story's told. Or if nobody knows your name. To Him it's all the same. He's sold Himself to buy your life. And He wants to make it right. He's sold Himself to buy your life. And He wants to make it right. And He's saying to you</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus x2)    </segment5>
