		<segment1>As he looks at the mirror he sees. All the scars he's obtained from the past memories. But he has no regrets of the past. Cause the future he holds is a hope that will last. As he turns and he runs from the gray. He's becoming a hunter instead of the prey. Like a redwood stuck in the ground. He can never be moved from the truth he's found. He says. I'm gonna shout it out. I'm gonna shout it loud. This world won't shake me now. I'm gonna shout it out. I'm gonna shout it loud. This world can't shake me now. As the earth all around him shakes. He just laughs as he stands like a five ton weight. Everything that surrounds him collides. But he's safe from it all cause he sees through the lies. With his hands lifted up to the air. Now he calls out a name that the rocks only dare. His faith nailed down so tight. Like the nails that were binding his God that night. He says. No...They won't ever move me. No...So why even try. No...They won't ever understand a faith that they deny. No...I won't keep the silence. No...I will amplify. No...There will be no whispers my stand will intensify    </segment1>
