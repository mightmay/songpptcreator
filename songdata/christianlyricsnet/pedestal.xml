		<segment1>You're the coolest person. That I have ever seen. So perfect with your pretty face. On the TV screen</segment1>
		<segment2>You're a god I know it. How you stand above them all. You are my perfect person. Man I'd hate to see you fall</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus. I want someone to believe in. Yeah well don't we all. In this life of imperfection. I need someone who won't fall</segment3>
		<segment4>Got a magazine today. That was full of you. Shocked to read the words they said. Tell me they're not true</segment4>
		<segment5>Add you to my fallen list. One more has hit the ground. The fault was mine. I held you too high. Your only way was down</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>Bridge. I can't deny this need inside. I have to find the perfect one. But I wonder if behind my need. There might just be a reason</segment7>
		<segment8>Is my life just one big searching. For the one I can adore?. It never works. And I'm just left here wanting more</segment8>
		<segment9>Could it be this hunger's there. To drive me to the one. Who's worthy of all worship?. Would my searching then be done?</segment9>
		<segment10>Chorus    </segment10>
