		<segment1>The moon is down, and heaven is waiting. for us to find her in our sites. with focus that's strong. but my strength keeps slipping.</segment1>
		<segment2>Now we're all the terminal cases, but were so determined to thrive. And those with defeat on their faces, are those that we must keep alive. And I admire your strength. You keep us going on. You keep us fighting long after the fire.</segment2>
		<segment3>You've measured our strides, marked the degree of our fever. Charted the log. Made sure the temperature's rising.</segment3>
		<segment4>To fan the flames, and brandish our new courage proudly, as if it were ours from the outset. As if we were never alone.</segment4>
		<segment5>The moon is down, and heaven is waiting, for callers and entries. as we're calling out: &quot;This is ours, ours, ours. This one is ours!&quot;</segment5>
		<segment6>Now we're all the terminal cases, but we're so determined to thrive. And those with defeat on their faces, are those that we must keep alive. And I admire your strength, you keep us going on, you keep us fighting, long after the fire.    </segment6>
