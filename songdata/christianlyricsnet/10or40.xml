		<segment1>Singing with the windows down. I'm driving down the street. and i hope that i'm the only one. Who doesn't have a/c. 'Cause my voice is often cracking. and even sometimes laughing. As i lift my voice to Jesus. and fight the friday traffic. I sing, &quot;amazing love, How can it be?&quot;. My voice flows out the window. Into the summer heat. Like the heat my voice is rising. Breaking through the pink horizon. Winking at the sun and flying home. and i don't mind the weather. 'Cause my seats aren't made of leather. If my car would keep on going. I could sing this song forever. Lord, lead this vehicle. Lord, lead this vehicle. I can't drive forever. The song is almost over. The sun is setting. The needle approaches empty. despite the heat. My feel are getting cold. From where they've been. and where they'll go. They'll go. Something tells me. That they should be poised. and ready to. Kick the window. I heard you. and i found myself. In a field one day. I'll stop the car. In rainwater. I'll go by foot from here     </segment1>
