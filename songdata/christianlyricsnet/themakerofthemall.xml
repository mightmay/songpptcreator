		<segment1>The rich and the poor, theyve got this in common. The Lord is the maker of em all. The bum in the boxcar the guitar pickin rock star. The Lord is the maker of em all</segment1>
		<segment2>Hallelujah Hallelujah. He knows when the sparrow flies and when that sparrow falls. The quiet and the loud the humble and the proud. The Lord is the maker of em all</segment2>
		<segment3>The lost and the found theyve got this in common. The Lord is the maker of em all. The hands that have to fight the hands that pray for peace at night. The Lord is the maker off em all</segment3>
		<segment4>Hallelujah Hallelujah. He knows when the sparrow flies and when that sparrow falls. The givers and the takers the movers and the shakers. The Lord is the maker of em all</segment4>
		<segment5>Well, Hallelujah Hallelujah. He knows when the sparrow flies and when that sparrow falls. The left and the right the black and the white. The Lord is the maker of em all. The losers and the winners the saints and the sinners. Yeah, the Lord is the maker of us all    </segment5>
