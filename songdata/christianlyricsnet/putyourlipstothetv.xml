		<segment1>You want my head in a basket. (cause) This town ain't big enough for. The two of us are disaster. I'm not your &quot;stepchild&quot; anymore</segment1>
		<segment2>You can kiss me goodbye. Just put your lips to the TV</segment2>
		<segment3>You want my head on a platter. Cause I'm no longer in your control</segment3>
		<segment4>You can kiss me goodbye. Just put your lips to the TV. Cause it's the only way you will see me again.     </segment4>
