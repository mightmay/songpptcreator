		<segment1>There was darkness in my soul. Till I turned my heart toward you. Now I worship at your feet. As I boldly come to your throne. To bless your holy name</segment1>
		<segment2>I was empty in my heart. Till you filled my with your power. Now I praise you more and more. Until on that day, with no more wait. We'll see you face to face</segment2>
		<segment3>You have become my ray of light. When I knew my sun was fading. You are the source of all my soul. You're the pure fire penetrating. You have become my ray of light</segment3>
		<segment4>There was blindness in my eyes. Till you touched me with your hand. Now a passion burns within. To be swept away in your embrace. Forever and a day</segment4>
		<segment5>I lift up my heart to you. I lift up my hands to you. I give all my praise you you</segment5>
		<segment6>I lift up my life to you. I lift up this song to you. I give all my praise to you.     </segment6>
