		<segment1>I'm holding this picture. You drew when you were four. It was one we proudly hung. On our refrigerator door. I found it in the attic. In your old dresser drawer. By a pillow that we made you. And a blanket that you had. When we learned to chase the monsters. From underneath your bed. And I remember</segment1>
