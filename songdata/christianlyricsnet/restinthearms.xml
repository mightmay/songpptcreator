		<segment1>When you're broken, when you're weak. When you turn the other check. When you cannot speak, Of the bitter sweet, The bitter sweetness. When the floor gives out beneath, And everything that you believe, Cannot give you peace. you're broken inside, Broken in pieces. (Chorus). You can. Rest in the arms of the one who holds you. Rest in the arms of the one who knows you. Rest in the arms of the one who won?t let go. You can. Rest in the arms of the one who holds you. Rest in the arms of the one who loves you. Rest in the arms of the one who won?t let go. When the water starts the rise. And you've lost the will to fight. When you're losing light, Just close your eyes, Close your eyes now. (Chorus). Have no fear. i'll be here. (Chorus).     </segment1>
