		<segment1>All the stars are out tonight it feels as though I might. Make some sense out of this madness will it turn out right. Who's to say where the wind will blow</segment1>
		<segment2>Time will tell us if we're out of answers when it stops. Climb back down to the beginning. Take it from the top. Who's to say where the wind will blow</segment2>
		<segment3>What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground. Do you pick up the pieces all around. And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know. Take your chances turn around and go</segment3>
		<segment4>All the leaves are turning and the sky fades to gray. Strange our life coincides with the seasons of today. Who's to say where the wind will blow</segment4>
		<segment5>What happens when everything is lying on the ground. Do you pick up the pieces all around</segment5>
		<segment6>And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know. Take your chances turn around and go</segment6>

		<segment8>Maybe when the sun crashes through the gray. I can find the strength to make it through the day. Through the day</segment8>
		<segment9>What happens when all your dreams are lying on the ground. Do you pick up the pieces all around</segment9>
		<segment10>And if the world should fall apart hold on to what you know. Take your chances turn around and go. Take your chances turn around and go.     </segment10>
