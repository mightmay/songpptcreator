		<segment1>Kicked in the head again today why do I have to be like this. I've wasted so much time just wondering what it is and if it's right. Why does it have to hurt so much to fight. With failure chasing at my feet I will not be afraid to dream. My hopes been loss so many times I think I'm gonna lose my mind. How many times before I get it right. Once again what can I do. I'm so sick of missing you. Down this road I've been before. All I want is to live for more. Lying in bed awake at night when will I ever fall asleep. Yet I can't seem to find the rhyme to help me finish up this line. How many times before I get it right. Once again what can I do. I'm so sick of missing you. Down this road I've been before. All I want is to live for more. I won't lie down for what I know is right. I bet it happened one too many times. Constant pressure ringing in my mind. We'll be silent tonight. Once again what can I do. I'm so sick of missing you. Down this road I've been before. All I want is to live for more. Once again what can I do. I'm so sick of missing you. Down this road I've been before. All I want is to live for more</segment1>
