		<segment1>Enter through the narrow gate, for wide is the gate and broad is. the road that leads to destruction. and many enter through it, but small is the gate and narrow. the road that lead to life. (Matthew 7:13-14)</segment1>
		<segment2>Will I go past the gate?. Into your righteousness?. I want to be with you. Help me to live today,</segment2>
		<segment3>will you find me worthy?. will you find my heart true?</segment3>
		<segment4>Make me worthy, make my heart true.    </segment4>
