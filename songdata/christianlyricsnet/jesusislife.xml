		<segment1>Ladies and Gentleman, children of all ages. Anyone listening, Ive got an announcement to make. Theres been some confusion about a certain someone. A lot of discussion and a lot of debate. So if I may take just a moment to say who Jesus is to me</segment1>
		<segment2>Jesus is life, yeah, oh, oh, oh. Jesus is life, yeah, oh, oh, oh. The air Im breathing. Why my heart is beating. Everything Im needing. Jesus is life. Jesus is life</segment2>
		<segment3>Imagine the deepest sea without a drop of water. An infinite galaxy without even one single star. Thats how I would beso absolutely empty. Without Jesus life in me thered be no life at all. More than just a part, Hes the very heart of everything I am</segment3>
		<segment4>This is my position concerning my condition. This is my position concerning my condition. This is my position my life by definition</segment4>
		<segment5>Jesus is life. Jesus is life. Jesus is life. Jesus is life.     </segment5>
