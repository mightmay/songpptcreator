		<segment1>Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance. I just wanna praise You. I just wanna praise You. You broke the chains, now I can lift my hands. And I'm gonna praise You. I'm gonna praise You </segment1>
		<segment2>In the corners of mind. I just can't seem to find a reason to believe. That I can break free. Cause you see I have been down for so long. Feel like all hope is gone. But as I lift my hands, I understand. That I should praise You through my circumstance </segment2>
		<segment3>Everything that could go wrong. All went wrong at one time. So much pressure fell on me. I thought I was gonna lose my mind. But I know You wanna see. If I will hold on through these trials. But I need You to lift this load. Cause I can't take it no more </segment3>
		<segment4>Been through the fire and the rain. Bound in every kind of way. But God has broken every chain. So let me go    </segment4>
