		<segment1>Fresh air, (sigh), Is what I needed. I ventured through my door. Proceeded. Into the streets of this place. I had to lower my shades to shade my face. Still squinting from the glare. What I saw was unfortunately rare. I rolled upon a variety. The sight that moved my heart. Deep inside of me. I head some cats rockin mics. Saw mad stunts on BMX bikes. Sons and daughters. Standing for their rights. A city scene lit. Well through the night. Tilted trucker hats with tats. Hittin high hats. Pinstripe sellard suits. Invested mad beats. Truth. Distinct how we live it. Many members but only one spirit.</segment1>
		<segment2>Individualized. You're on the same side. Separated verticals. Huh!. We still ride. Well we bring it from nice to gritty. Read the sign kid, Diverse City.    </segment2>
