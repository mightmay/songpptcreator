		<segment1>It all comes down to what I never said. When I'm breaking your heart just like you broke my head. You said I could believe you still but I didn't then. And it all comes down to what has never been</segment1>
		<segment2>So you set me down into a padded cell. All I get today is a little taste of hell. You let me to believe you so you could shut me out. And now you rest assured beyond a show of doubt</segment2>
		<segment3>Can I fall apart in your tired willing arms?. I lack the courage to admit you were ever wrong. Do I seem afraid when you turn the other way?. From everything I do that comes back around again    </segment3>
