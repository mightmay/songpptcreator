		<segment1>You are too far away from me. I can't see your face. I'm barely breathing. The image of you is shattered in my mind. I can't see you clearly. I can't see you clearly. Never though I'd be this far from you. If only I could feel you near. If I could only see you clearly. Alone nobody hears me cry. If I could only see you clearly. Feeling you near is up to me. I know these thoughts have made me far away from you. I know I need you. I know I need you. To make me whole. To bring me back. To make me whole. I know I need you. I know I need you. You're my only hope. To make me whole. To bring me back. I need you now. To make me whole. To bring me back. You're my only hope. If only I could feel you near. I need you now. Never thought I'd be this far from you. If only I could feel you near. If I could only see you clearly. Alone nobody hears my cry. If I could only see you clearly. Feeling you near is up to me. Alone nobody hears my cry. Feeling you near is up to me. Never thought I'd be this far from you. If only I could feel you near. If I could only see you clearly. Alone nobody hears my cry. If I could only see you clearly. Feeling you near is up to me </segment1>
