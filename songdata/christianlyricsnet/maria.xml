		<segment2>Who who's gonna love Maria. Who who's gonna touch her with the tenderness she longs for. Like a desert longs for rain. She's got a hunger deep inside and with every tear she cries. She wonder's if there's someone out there somewhere. Who's gonna love Maria</segment2>
		<segment3>(Maria) she looks in the mirror now and the little girl is gone. And still the search for someone's love goes on and on for Maria. But does anybody care or even notice her at all. Is anyone listening close enough to hear her calling (who)</segment3>
		<segment4>Who who's gonna love Maria. Who who's gonna touch her with the tenderness she longs for. Like a desert longs for rain. She's got a hunger deep inside and with every tear she cries. She wonder's if there's someone out there </segment4>
