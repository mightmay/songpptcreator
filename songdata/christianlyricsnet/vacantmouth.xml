		<segment1>I took this picture in the dark. Spinning in lights till we fell apart. So turn it away, turn it away. You don't know what I've seen. The youth is hollow and so are we. They give it away, give it away</segment1>
		<segment2>This is what it feels like. This is disintegration. This is what it feels like. This is isolation</segment2>
		<segment3>I can't find the light. Inside this empty room I cannot find myself. I won't let you down</segment3>
		<segment4>I hold on by a single thread. Sweet solitude is so complete in my head. You watch me dangle there and become just a memory. Like they said I would end up</segment4>
		<segment5>The youth is marching to tear us down. We built our lives here. We fight their calling</segment5>
		<segment6>Take sides. Line up and take sides</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm so sick of you calling the shots. (I'll tear you down from the inside)</segment7>
		<segment8>I can't find the light. Inside this empty room I seem to loose myself. I won't let you down</segment8>
		<segment9>So write this down I'm not using my lungs anymore. This is the last time. Write it down, I won't be your voice anymore.     </segment9>
