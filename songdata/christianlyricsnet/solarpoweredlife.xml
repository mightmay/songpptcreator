		<segment1>he's got a solar powered life. She dies without direct sunlight. But every morning in the spring. She wakes up early. And this is what she sings</segment1>
		<segment2>My oh my what a beautiful day outside. Hey hey what a beautiful day. My oh my what a beautiful day outside. Hey hey what a beautiful day. Yeah</segment2>
		<segment3>My baby gets depressed at night. All hope is gone with the twilight. But every morning after dawn. She sings to me. And this is her love song</segment3>
		<segment4>My oh my what a beautiful day outside. Hey hey what a beautiful day. My oh my what a beautiful day outside (beautiful day). Hey hey what a beautiful day. Yeah</segment4>
		<segment5>I give you everything you need. I give vacations by the sea. If that's what you need girl. I give you everything you want. Sitting sipping smoothies with your sunglasses on</segment5>
		<segment6>My oh my what a beautiful day outside (beautiful day). Hey hey what a beautiful day (beautiful day). My oh my what a beautiful day outside (beautiful day). Hey hey what a beautiful day (beautiful day). My oh my what a beautiful day outside (beautiful day). Hey hey what a beautiful day (beautiful day). Yeah    </segment6>
