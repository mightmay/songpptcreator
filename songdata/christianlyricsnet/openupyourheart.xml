		<segment1>I can see that you are lost, I've come to find you. Even though you chose to leave and go your way. You thought you'd find more than what I could give you. So I let you go, still I want you to know. I've seen you struggle, I've seen you crying. Seen you do those things you swore you would never do. Your guilty soul has got you slowly dying. What you're running from, you should run to</segment1>
		<segment2>Open up your heart to me and I will set you free. Open up your eyes and see, I'm everything you need. Open up your mind and know, I'll never let you go. It won't be hard for you to believe, If you open up your heart to me</segment2>
		<segment3>You turn here and there for those things to make you happy. you're on high but when you crash those things tear you apart. Your broken heart needs a love that's real. And you will find. One touch from heaven is what will heal. That touch is mine. You can, start again if you..</segment3>
		<segment4>Open up your heart to me and I will set you free. Open up your eyes and see, I'm everything you need. Open up your mind and know, I'll never let you go. It won't be hard for you to believe, If you open up your heart to me</segment4>
		<segment5>And when yours does fail you, you will find your strength in me. When you fall or lose your place you'll still be safe with me. Come out of the darkness into light so you can see. I died for you, you must believe, and open up your heart</segment5>
		<segment6>Open up your heart to me and I will set you free. Open up your eyes and see, I'm everything you need. Open up your mind and know, I'll never let you go. It won't be hard for you to believe, If you open up your heart to me    </segment6>
