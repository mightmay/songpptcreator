		<segment1>I have faith no one believes. I love a God no one can see. You put your trust into thin air. That's what they all told me. But I believed because of fear, And I can see you crystal clear. I know that you will, meet me here.</segment1>
		<segment2>I walk the narrow path. Perplexed and befuddled. I'm persecuted, plagued and I'm troubled.</segment2>
		<segment3>My past my history, My future's a mystery. There's only one certain thing. That's for sure.</segment3>
		<segment4>It's my God who is so real. He makes my life easier to deal. With the aid of his goodness. I experience true bliss. Do you understand your life is in his hands? </segment4>
		<segment5>Confusion is my hat;. Centrifuge of hurt is where I'm at. I request some help with that.</segment5>
		<segment6>My past my history, My future's a mystery. There's only one certain thing that's for sure.</segment6>
		<segment7>It's my God who is so real. He makes my life easier to deal. With the aid of his goodness. I experience true bliss. Do you understand your life is in his hands? </segment7>
		<segment8>I have faith no one believes. I love a God no one can see. You put your trust into thin air. That's what they all told me.    </segment8>
