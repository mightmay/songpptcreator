		<segment1>Knock knock knock. Sound the blows to the forehead from the. Mock mock mock. Of the words, a voice I hear every morning </segment1>
		<segment2>Like stalking me from yesterday. The taunts of one who sought to frame. The picture of this desolate. This figure cowering </segment2>
		<segment3>Every word a double edged sword. A double edged sword. My every word </segment3>
		<segment4>Drop drop drop. Sound the sledge to the metal. Shot shot shot. Sound the pin to the chamber. My own words pound after me. Intentions bent on conquering. The very will I proudly claimed. Was the very axe that cut the nape </segment4>
		<segment5>Every word a double edged sword. A double edged sword. My every word </segment5>
		<segment6>(I'll never, ever look back. Sitting still, sitting still. Arrogant mindset of lusts. They search and strain and drink and stagger. When we are hollow. Sitting still, sitting still. You hate us cause we'll never go away) </segment6>
		<segment7>&quot;You can drown. In your own mistakes. Burrowing into the black. Or you can take my hand&quot; </segment7>
		<segment8>Double. Edged. Sword. My every word </segment8>
		<segment9>&quot;This gift was never yours. So why would you ever think. That the words you said were your own?. I have chosen and breathed and forgiven and changed and purged and cleaned and forgave and bathed and carried and soothed and burned and spoken and spoken and spoken and spoken and spoken and spoken and spoken.. Yours is not to proclaim.. But only to obey.&quot;.     </segment9>
