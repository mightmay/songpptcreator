		<segment1>I have been the wayward child. I have acted out. I have questioned Sovereignty. And had my share of doubt. And though sometimes my prayers feel like. They're bouncing off the sky. The hand I hold won't let me go. And is the reason why..</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. I will stumble. I will fall down. But I will not be moved. I will make mistakes. I will face heartache. But I will not be moved. On Christ the Solid Rock I stand. All other ground is sinking sand. I will not be moved</segment2>
		<segment3>Bitterness has plagued my heart. Many times before. My life has been like broken glass. And I have kept the score. Of all my shattered dreams and though it seemed. That I was far too gone. My brokenness helped me to see. It's grace I'm standing on</segment3>
		<segment4>[Chorus]</segment4>
		<segment5>And the chaos in my life. Has been a badge I've worn. Though I have been torn. I will not be moved</segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus]     </segment6>
