		<segment1>This white blows so softly. The movement still is in my mind. This flag flown in Reedsport. Will start to catch beneath the wind. Catch beneath the wind.</segment1>
		<segment2>It's only in your dreams. It's only in your dreams. So exit the fall, and now it's over. It's only in your dreams.</segment2>
		<segment3>This flight comes, it's nameless. The dark is calling out my name. Escape with no traces. The movement burns inside my veins. Burns inside my veins.</segment3>
		<segment4>By now this tide is here. I thought I made it clear. This is the threat. This is the fall.</segment4>
		<segment5>And now its over.</segment5>
		<segment6>(Psalm 73:20)    </segment6>
