		<segment1> should have stayed in bed today. I couldn't think of a positive thing to say. My friends all hate me now. I was selfish and realize now. I have it a little time. I thought about it a while. Ask to forgive and forget. Crack a joke and a smile. It's hard to say you're sorry. When you know that you were wrong. The weight of hurting words. We often carry on. The annoying things I don't mind so much anymore. I've learned to tolerate the annoying four. I won't let the sun go down. When I've made a mistake. I'd make right what I've wronged. And give more that I take</segment1>
