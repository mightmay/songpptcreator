		<segment1>Bleeding thoughts. Cracking boulder. Don't fall over. Fake your laughter. Burn the tear. Sing it louder, Twist and shout </segment1>
		<segment2>Way up here. We stand on shoulders. Growing colder. Laugh or cry. I wont mind. Sing it louder, Twist and shout </segment2>
		<segment3>Immovable shadows. Concrete girl. They'll rock your world. To nothing. And they're swimming. Around again, again. And they're swimming. Around the concrete girl </segment3>
		<segment4>Catch your breath. Like four leaf clover. Hand it over </segment4>
		<segment5>Scream to no one. Take your time. Sing it louder, Twist and shout </segment5>
		<segment6>Nothing to run from. Is worse than something. And all your fears. Of nothing. And they're swimming. Around again, again. And they're swimming. Around the concrete girl </segment6>
		<segment7>Concrete girl. Don't fall down. In this broken world. Around you. Concrete girl. Don't fall down. Don't fall down. My concrete girl. Don't stop thinking. Don't stop feeling </segment7>
		<segment8>One step away. From where we were. And one step back. To nothing. And we're standing on top. Of hopes and fears. And we're fighting. For words now. Concrete girl. And we're swimming. Around again, again. And we're swimming. Around now. Concrete girl     </segment8>
