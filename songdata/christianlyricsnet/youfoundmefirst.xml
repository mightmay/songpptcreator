		<segment1>I thought I was ahead of the game. Even though I could not name what I was looking for. I thought I had it all worked out. Even though I was feeling the worry and the doubt. I tried to hide behind myself. but You saw right through myself</segment1>
		<segment2>(chorus). You found me first. When I was at my worst. And now I know the love of Jesus Christ. Cause I have You in my life</segment2>
		<segment3>When I did not know what love was for. It was the very key that opened my heart's door. I thought this peace was just a dream. Like there wasn't anything like this for me. I searched this world and all I found was lies. and then You opened up my eyes</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>All these years I could not find the truth. all these times i could not see. All these years i could not find You. And all this time You were watching over me</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus.     </segment6>
