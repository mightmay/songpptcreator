		<segment1>Just drifting along with the world. Every motion is paranoid and paralyzing. Give it up or give em hope. Let us all survive the wake. We, were a race, a human race. Under the glass behind it all. Watch us crawl so fearfully. I might be wrong after all. But werent we just so delicate yesterday. Sit back and think about it. Sleep it off, sleep on it. Come to, and make your motions. Listen up. Theres a calling ahead. A desperation. A falling of man. We are all lost in the sound of separation. Hands in the air and love at our sides. Theres gotta be something bigger. With the beating in our throats. And the tremble in our grip. This cant be it. Ill come up for peace. Ill come down for truth. Ill give in, Ill give up for you. The floors are shaking. And weve lost our step. Oh Lord, have mercy on us all.     </segment1>
