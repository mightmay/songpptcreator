		<segment1>Tell myself, on the ride home. Getting tired, hating all I've known. Holding on, like it's all I have. Count me out, when it's clear that I, find it hard to say. And you, find it hard to care.</segment1>
		<segment2>I wanted to see something that's different, something you said would change in me. Wanted to be, anything different, everything you would change in me.</segment2>
		<segment3>Got this way, upfront but never true. God I'm wrong, it's just the way I am. Crashing down, any chance you hear. Caving in, any chance that you, could see inside of me. And I don't know what to say, It's fine. This isn't Hollywood. So fine, getting in your way.</segment3>
		<segment4>I wanted to see something that's different, something you said would change in me. Wanted to be, anything different, everything you would change in me.</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm taking a chance, this could be different. This could be all I'm waiting for. Taking a chance, this could be different. This could be all I'm waiting for.</segment5>
		<segment6>I wanted to see something that's different, something you said would change in me. Wanted to be, anything different, everything you would change in me.</segment6>
		<segment7>Something that's different. Something that's different    </segment7>
