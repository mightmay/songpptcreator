		<segment1>Close the door to be sure. As I take a new direction. I leave behind my former ways. And cast aside this world's affections </segment1>
		<segment2>And I won't think twice because </segment2>
		<segment3>Your love healed my broken heart. And Your love bought me a brand new start. A brand new start </segment3>
		<segment4>The wisdom of the cross is foolish. To the one who won't receive it. But it is power just the same. To all who will believe it </segment4>
		<segment5>I believe it because </segment5>
		<segment6>Your love healed my broken heart. And Your love bought me a brand new start. A brand new start </segment6>
		<segment7>I'm never goin' back. To that old place. Never goin' back. Since my past has been erased. Never goin' back. In His grace I will remain. Never goin' back. To my old ways    </segment7>
