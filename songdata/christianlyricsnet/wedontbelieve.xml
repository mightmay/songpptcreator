We look right over the shoulder of a friend (a weakness so self-contained). To wage a war that has no standing, no lasting value. And brutal repercussions that will leave a man alone. It's hard to negate what you've known. Putting yourself out on the line. Even when we don't believe in us. This life has a hold of me, to a place where I dare not go. Reinstate    </segment1>
