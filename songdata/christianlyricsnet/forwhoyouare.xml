		<segment1>Totally, Completely, Entirely amazing. That unseen has become seen. And is to me unfailing</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You are the Lord, The Father of Lights. You are God the Keeper of my heart. And I praise You, and I praise You. You are the lover of my soul. You are the giver of the second start. And I praise You, for who You are</segment2>
		<segment3>It seems too high for me to reach. To wrap my mind around the mystery. That who You are so constantly. Is who You're marking me to be</segment3>
		<segment4>And who You are does not rely on what I'm currently surrounded by. You're teaching me to fly, teach me to fly so high    </segment4>
