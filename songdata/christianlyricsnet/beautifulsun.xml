		<segment1>I would do anything, to stay by Your side. 'Til the darkness flies away. I'm lost in the shadows. When will day begin?</segment1>
		<segment2>With the sun, beautiful sun</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm grabbing for miracles to feel You close by. To surround me with Your song. I know uncertainty, but truth lights the way</segment3>
		<segment4>Like the sun, beautiful sun. Like the sun, beautiful sun</segment4>
		<segment5>And I have to say I put on the line. All of my faith yes all of the time. Eye has not seen and no ear has heard. I still believe the invisible word</segment5>
		<segment6>Grace is my story, hope is my song. You have been so good to me. I should have nothing, but I've got it all</segment6>
		<segment7>With the Son, beautiful Son. Beautiful Son, beautiful Son. Gonna lay in the Son, beautiful Son    </segment7>
