		<segment1>How could I see you when I was so blind. How could I grasp you when I was far behind. How could I hear you when I was so deaf. How could I get up when I had been left</segment1>
		<segment2>But You said, &quot;dont worry&quot;. For Ive healed the blind man. And Ive set the captives free. And You said, &quot;dont worry&quot;. For all youve gotta do. Is put your trust in Me</segment2>
		<segment3>How could I be clean when I was so dirty. How could I be made whole when I was torn apart. Make me whole, make me whole. Make me whole again    </segment3>
