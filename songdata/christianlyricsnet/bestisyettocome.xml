		<segment1>Afraid it won't come 'round again. Afraid to move on. Wishing i could go back when. Everything was easier and meaningful to me. Wanting all we left behind. Like it's the answer. An hourglass we can't rewind. Holding back the life that I've denied for so long. Can i find my way to you?</segment1>
		<segment2>And after all that we've been through. And after all we left in pieces. I still believe our lives have just begun. 'Cause now the past can be outrun. And I know you are the reason. I still believe the best is yet to come</segment2>
		<segment3>A photograph still in my hands. Afraid to let go. The minutes rain like grains of sand. And time is just a war that's stealing dreams from within. So come and take them back again</segment3>
		<segment4>After all that we've been through. And after all we left in pieces. I still believe our lives have just begun. 'Cause now the past can be our own. And I know you are the reason. I still believe the best is yet to come</segment4>
		<segment5>I won't turn around. And let it slip all away. I'm never backing down. 'Cause tomorrow's a new day. And everything can change</segment5>
		<segment6>After all that we've been through. And after all we left in pieces. I still believe our lives have just begun. 'Cause now the past can be our own. And I know you are the reason. I still believe the best is yet to come    </segment6>
