		<segment1>so many dreamers, livin life against the wall. and when i look into the mirror, i see the greatest of them all. i dream of what i could be, beyond the fear and doubt. when i face the hope of God gives me, my faith will work out. . i gotta take a chance, the key is letting go. because until a man can take a chance, how is he to know. . CHORUS: every step i take. theres a way for God to prove what a little trust can do. every step of faith. i know, i know, i know. my God will see me through, with every step i take. . oh what a hard life so many have allowed. and if you look a little closer, youll see me in that crowd. i know what Godll give me, but i reach for so much less. and in the end. what im left holding, is nothing near the best. . im gonna take a chance, and aim for higher ground. cause unless a man can take a risk, it never can be found    </segment1>
