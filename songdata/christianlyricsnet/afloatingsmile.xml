		<segment1>Im sad that I dont think about you. Cause I Just cant get on without you. You speak on the funniest things. Glimpses of heaven and dreams. Lately it seems that its harder. For our legs to walk any farther. I need you to show me I need you. And give me the faith to believe you</segment1>
		<segment2>One day youll come back. Soon youll come back. One day youll take me home (repeat)    </segment2>
