		<segment1>The archers come to edge of ferns. The wind it floats so cold with words. You're in and out of sleep tonight. And it led you to shed to hide</segment1>
		<segment2>Breathing in the dark. They're finding where you are</segment2>
		<segment3>If you are, then you know the phone's tapped. The last of the maps are breaking codes. You've seen the night thieves like sharpened knife bleeds through. The moon shows, that you're in reverse. The moon shows, that you're in reverse</segment3>
		<segment4>Breathing in the dark. They're finding where you are    </segment4>
