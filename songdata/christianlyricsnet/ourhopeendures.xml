		<segment1>You would think only so much can go wrong. Calamity only strikes once. And you assume this one has suffered her share. Life will be kinder from here. Oh, but sometimes the sun stays hidden for years. Sometimes the sky rains night after night. When will it clear?</segment1>
		<segment2>But our Hope endures the worst of conditions. It's more than our optimism. Let the earth quake. Our Hope is unchanged</segment2>
		<segment3>How do we comprehend peace within pain?. Or joy at a good man's wake?. Walk a mile with the woman whose body is torn. With illness but she marches on. Oh, 'cause sometimes the sun stays hidden for years. Sometimes the sky rains night after night. When will it clear?</segment3>
		<segment4>But our Hope endures the worst of conditions. It's more than our optimism. Let the earth quake. Our Hope is unchanged</segment4>
		<segment5>Emmanuel, God is with us. El Shaddai, all sufficient. We never walk alone. And this is our hope</segment5>
		<segment6>But our Hope endures the worst of conditions. It's more than our optimism. Let the earth quake. Our Hope is unchanged.     </segment6>
