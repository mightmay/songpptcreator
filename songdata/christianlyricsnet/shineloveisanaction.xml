		<segment1>I want to strike a match. Let it burn til the worlds on fire. I want to see a chain reaction. And see the flames burn higher. I want to see Your Word alive. I want to see the orphans laughing. Want to see the sinners cry. Surrounded by the hands of mercy. The hands of mercy, so</segment1>
		<segment2>Shine, love is an action. Shine, oh, it starts with a passion. Cause we want to be a heart thats pure. So all will see that we are Yours. Shine</segment2>
		<segment3>And though it starts with one. There will be a million candles. There will be millions more. Singing with the tongues of angels. The light of Heaven falling down. Spreading love to the darkest places. I want to strike a match. And watch it bring salvation. Im gonna lift my light up high</segment3>
		<segment4>(Love is an action). Im gonna let my love burn bright. (It starts with a passion)</segment4>
		<segment5>Im gonna lift my light up high. (So all will see that we are Yours)</segment5>
		<segment6>Im gonna let my love burn bright. (Let it burn, let it burn)</segment6>
		<segment7>I want to strike a match. Let it burn, Let it burn. Ill let it burn    </segment7>
