		<segment1>I need a lonely day with you, sometime. I need to get away with you, sometime. I've got a crowd of things going on, in my mind. I need a lonely day with you, sometime. Sometimes, I never get there, sometimes.</segment1>
		<segment2>Stealing time, Am I forever. Stealing time to be with you.</segment2>
		<segment3>I remember love's first days, Precious moments, we had all the time in the world. Still You thrill me, still You heal me. Still need a lonely day with you, sometime. Sometimes, I never get there. Sometimes, can I ever get there?</segment3>
		<segment4>This time, will I ever really get there?    </segment4>
