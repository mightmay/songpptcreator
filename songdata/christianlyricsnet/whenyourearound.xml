		<segment1>Like a child having nightmares. I will run, I'll run into your arms. I'll give you all of my cares and. This world will do me no more harm</segment1>
		<segment2>When you're around. I don't know what to say. I don't know what to do. To let you know just what I'm thinking</segment2>
		<segment3>I want to stay longer. I made you you a place, a place within my heart. With you I'm so much stronger. That's why I'm glad we'll never have to part    </segment3>
