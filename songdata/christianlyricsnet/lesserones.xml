		<segment1>look ahead and see the place to meet me. is only about halfway. but fissures running up your face defeat me. and echo the words i say. it's a stone I would throw after-. but you're much too far away. and i'd be sure to miss. you'll remember i said this, one day. consider the lesser ones. your daughters and yes, your sons. let it come, and with it bring. feeling anew. (but) it don't mean a thing. (to you). you give only broken hints for weeks now. so tell me how did you fare?. i don't think we've spoken since you found out. and maybe i shouldn't care. so in self pity drown when you're down under water. wishing you were there. how long will you last. without ever coming up for air?. another day goes by and still i wait for you. still, i cannot deny the things i know are true. we'll wait it out and see, a minute more. a minute more. consider the lesser ones. your daughters and yes, your sons. if you ever want them back. then maybe try meeting them where they're at    </segment1>
