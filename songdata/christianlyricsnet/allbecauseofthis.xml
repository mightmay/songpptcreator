		<segment1>Why do we do the things we do. How can we sing when there seems no reason to. How do we smile when there's not much to smile about. When the world is down who are we to stand and shout. They wonder why we do the things we do</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: It's all because of this. It's all because of this. We've tasted love, tasted hope, tasted holiness. (Repeat)</segment2>
		<segment3>And they wonder why, we do the things we do    </segment3>
