		<segment1>Blaw. The sound becomes underground. And no matter how hard you try. You can't shout. We've come back. Step back. Hold it inside. No we won't take that. So stand up and fight. Hold unto what's yours. And gimme what's mine. Hold that sensation. To the last line. Last man standing. Be the first in commanding. I won't be the first one landing</segment1>
		<segment2>Point of no return - this is the. Point of no return - we've reached the. Point of no return - this is the. Point of no return - c'mon c'mon</segment2>
		<segment3>Now. Is it cool to say nothing. I don't think so. So we'll keep rocking. Party people in the house. Throw your hands in the air. And gimme somma some of that. Party atmosphere. Everybody knows. that it's gonna get hot. Everybody knows. that we have got. More to give. Cuz we don't dance with the devil. We're down with God. Call us rebels</segment3>
		<segment4>I've gone too far. I can't turn back, oh no    </segment4>
