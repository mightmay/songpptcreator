		<segment1>Make The Almighty your gold. And The Lord your precious treasure. Then you will find your delight in Him. And lift up your face to God. Make The Almighty your gold. And The Lord your precious treasure. Then you will find your delight in Him. And lift up your face to God. All that glitters is not gold. And the things we fill our lives with. Leave us empty and cold. And only craving more. How long will you love what is empty?. How long will you seek what is a lie?. What is it you want My child?. What is it your heart desires?. Ive given you so many things. Things you thought would satisfy. But, youre not happy, youre not happy..     </segment1>
