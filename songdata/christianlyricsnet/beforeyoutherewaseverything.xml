		<segment1>I made you promises, but i want them back. I gave you everything, but you stabbed me in the back. I finally figured out, that i can live without the pain i feel inside. I've opened up my eyes, begun to realize i trusted way to many lies. It's time to pick up the pieces now, am i falling down?. Am i drowning out?. Am i the only one who sees things this way?. Well, i guess it goes to show. Put me on my swing. I can see the whole world from here and i feel so alive. After all was said and done, more was said than done. (missing out on me). Put me on my swing. I can see the whole world from here and i feel so alive. Your missing out on me, baby out on me. Put me on my swing. I can see the whole world from here and i feel so alive. And i'm waiting, for you there. For you to care. I can see it in your eyes. And i'm running, but not giving up. Just giving in for now. Cause i can't pretend it's all ok. Missing    </segment1>
