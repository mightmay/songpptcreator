		<segment1>You know that kind of girl. That makes your heart beat all fast?. You know that kind of love. That you know will last?. I knew that kind of girl. I knew that kind of love. But then she broke it off. When I was so sure of her </segment1>
		<segment2>Don't trust that girl. She's up to no good. She'll mess with you. Like no one should </segment2>
		<segment3>Empty promises thrown into the wind. Mirage vanishes, never to see again. Hey fellas, be you ware. Don't wanna end up like me. Another victim of her stupid female schemes </segment3>
		<segment4>And so the time moves on. With feelings come and gone. And Christ is the One constant I can lean on. So now I am left here. Feeling like a schmuck. With one thought on my mind:_____________     </segment4>
