		<segment5>Suddenly my world, is falling apart. So suddenly so suddenly. Suddenly </segment5>
		<segment6>I have no strength at all. I've been hit with a loss. So suddenly my world falls apart. I have no strength at all. I've been hit with a loss. Suddenly my world falls apart. My world, falls apart </segment6>
		<segment7>Suddenly I have no strength at all. So suddenly hit with all I've lost. Suddenly my world, is falling apart. So suddenly so suddenly. Suddenly </segment7>
		<segment8>Suddenly I have no strength at all. So suddenly hit. So suddenly hit. Suddenly my world falls apart. So suddenly so suddenly. Suddenly    </segment8>
