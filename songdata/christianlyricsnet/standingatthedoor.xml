		<segment1>(verse 1). Cover Me, Let me touch your face. Run my hands, over every trace. I want to know, who you really are. and why you've come this far. (chorus). Cause you're standing at the door of every heart. Every ordinary. Standing at the door of every heart. Every ordinary man. OH,OH Ordinary man</segment1>
		<segment2>(verse 2). Take my hand, lead me to your place. Lay me down, on the bed you've made. I want to feel, your arms surrounding me. as I fall to my knees</segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). (solo)</segment3>
		<segment4>(bridge). I don't wanna wait, I just wanna taste. The manna melting on my tongue. Feel the water flow, from the fountain. Carrying the work that you've begun, that you've begun, The work that you've begun, OH, OH</segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus)(chorus).     </segment5>
