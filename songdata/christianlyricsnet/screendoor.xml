		<segment1>It's about as useless as. A screen door on a submarine. Faith without works baby. It just ain't happenin'. One is your left hand. One is your right. It'll take two strong arms. To hold on tight. Some folks cut off their nose. Just to spite their face. I think you need some works to show. For your alleged faith</segment1>
		<segment2>Well there's a difference you know. B'tween having faith and playing make believe. One will make you grow. The other one just make you sleep. Talk about it. But I really think you oughtta. Take a leap off of the ship. Before you claim to walk on water. Faith without works is like a song you can't sing. It's about as useless as a screen door on a submarine</segment2>
		<segment3>Faith comes from God. And every word that He breathes. He lets you take it to your heart. So you can give it hands and feet. It's gotta be active if it's gonna be alive. You gotta put it into practice. Otherwise..</segment3>
		<segment4>It's about as useless as a screen door. On a submarine. Faith without works, baby. It just ain't happenin'. One is your right hand, one is your left. It's your light, your guide. Your life and your breath</segment4>
		<segment5>Faith without works is like a song you can't sing. It's about as useless as a screen door. On a submarine    </segment5>
