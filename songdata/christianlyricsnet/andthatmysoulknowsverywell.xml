		<segment1>You make Your face to shine on me. And that my soul knows very well. You lift me up, I'm cleansed and free. And that my soul knows very well</segment1>
		<segment2>When mountains fall, I'll stand. By the power of Your hand. And in Your heart of heart I'll dwell. And that my soul knows very well</segment2>
		<segment3>Joy and strength each day I find. And that my soul knows very well. Forgiveness, hope, I know is mine. And that my soul knows very well     </segment3>
