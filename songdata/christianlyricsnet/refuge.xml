		<segment1>You call comes like the morning breeze. You spread Your wings and cover me. Underneath Your shadow. I will hide away. For there I've found Your shelter. And there I'd like to stay</segment1>
		<segment2>refuge You're my refuge. When the world is shaken. And nothing stands. I will hold on to Your hand. Refuge    </segment2>
