		<segment1>i'm calling out but i haven't heard a sound. i wonder where you are. and are you coming down. you reach for me and you know just why i came. all i only have to do is cry your name. holy spirit consume me. now let your wave of light shine through. somehow now I've called out and i can hear you loud. come my lord and save me. at the speed of sound let me sail out there with you. where i can fly out in the stars. i'll wait for you to take me in. and send me far. holy spirit consume me now. let your wave of light shine through somehow.     </segment1>
