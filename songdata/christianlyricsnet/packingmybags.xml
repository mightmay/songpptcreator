		<segment1>softly spoken heaven angel come and fly these wings. take me straight to heaven i can't take a faster way. i think this all i can bear. i would give up anything to be there. i'm not ashamed of what i am. i'm not scared of dying Jesus helps me play this game. when the bible ain't in no revival i'll be packing my bags i'm ready to go. i scream at the top of my lungs oh father where have your people gone?. i think this is all i can bear i would give up anything to be there.    </segment1>
