		<segment1>stress in your life. it's you've been untrue. there's been nothing new. forever. a look in your eyes. you look twice your age. you've been almost through. forever</segment1>
		<segment2>was this a training brood. they all passed us by. I wish they'd look at me. before I'm the one that cried. have you noticed that we're all getting old?. we're all getting old</segment2>
		<segment3>the look in your eyes. you look half my age. what have you been through. not much ever</segment3>
		<segment4>was this a training brood. they all passed us by. I wish they'd look at me. before I'm the one that cried. have you noticed that we're all getting old?. we're all getting old</segment4>
