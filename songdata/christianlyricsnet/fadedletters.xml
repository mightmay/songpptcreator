		<segment1>I look through photographs and faded letters from you. an empty shoebox on my bed. lingering thoughts of what you said. falling away from me</segment1>
		<segment2>they say that where I've been is not who I am. and where I am does not define where I'm going. someday I'll find this place</segment2>
		<segment3>I've dreamed up things that I just can't let go. [dreamed up things I can't let go.]. [Conform in me your perfect will.]</segment3>
		<segment4>and sometimes I hide, but you always find me. and sometimes I run, but you're always beside me. I feel you beside me, never behind me. I feel you beside me today</segment4>
		<segment5>this is my prayer, Lord that I'll find your will my ife is in your hands draw your plans. use my hands</segment5>
		<segment6>I've dreamed up things that I just can't let go. don't let me be this way - no. I don't want things my way. my delight is in you, my Holy Lord. conform me to your will. Lord, do with me what you will</segment6>
		<segment7>all these photographs and faded letters from you. an empty shoebox on my bed. lingering thoughts of what you said. show me a better me.    </segment7>
