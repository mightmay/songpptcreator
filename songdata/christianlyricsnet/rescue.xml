		<segment1>I've walked through the valley. Been tossed in the storm, yeah. And all of the demons. Were comin for more, yeah yeah. And anywhere I went. I was alone. You came to my rescue. So I can make it home</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: You got me fallin. More in love with you. You got me wrapped up. I can barely even move</segment2>
		<segment3>Even the good days. Can fade into black. Yeah I can only change. It happens too fast, too fast, too fast. I never even got a chance. If I was alone, if i was alone. If there was no rescue. I could never even make it home</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>When no one could find me. When everyone else had already moved on. You came to reach out. You never gave up on me. Even when hope was gone</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
