		<segment1>I should have told her more I love her. I should've spent more time at home. But should haves really aren't important. Since the fact is, now she's gone. I wish I'd listened to my conscience. When it said, &quot;Don't let her go&quot;. And if she's wonderin' how I'm doing. Well, I think she ought to know. That I find myself praying. More than I've ever did before. And now I find my heart is breaking. Each time her memory slams the door. And I find myself crying. And trying to hold on. Cause there ain't nothing short of dying. That's worse than being left alone</segment1>
		<segment2>I thought I'd be just fine without her. I'd be happy, a free man. But the hurting side of lonesome. Is what I didn't understand. And the lessons that I'm learning. Lord, I'm learning awful well. Cause nights I used to spend in heaven. Have been replaced by nights of hell. And I find myself praying. More than I've ever did before. And now I find my heart is breaking. Each time her memory slams the door. And I find myself crying. Oh, and trying to hold on. Cause there ain't nothing short of dying. That's worse than being left alone.     </segment2>
