		<segment1>You make me feel so alive. That I'm tryin' hard. Not to make moves. Choosin' the wrong place and time. Everyone will know. The minute we let it go. I can't hold it anymore. Let's be original </segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. No holes barred. Can you feel it?. Comin' along. Break the Silence. Non-directional. No holes barred. Can you feel it?. Comin' along, it's on. Hit the switch and turn me on </segment2>
		<segment3>You make me feel complicated sometimes. I try to explain the way. You took me turned it all around. Everyone will know. The minute we let it go. I can't take it anymore. Let's be original </segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS </segment4>
		<segment5>Cause I'm crawling my way through. I'm falling into you. I'm turning on things I though I knew. I'm slipping away. Every time I try to be more like you </segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS 2X </segment6>
		<segment7>BRIDGE. Get it on. If ya feel it comin' on. If you're real then come along. If you feel the song, come on. Bring it on, bring it on </segment7>
		<segment8>BRIDGE 3X    </segment8>
