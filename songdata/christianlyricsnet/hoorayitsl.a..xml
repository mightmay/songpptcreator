		<segment1>
You and me we should get out of this town tonight. Cause everywhere I put my foot down. It's just another concrete block waiting for me. And it's a dark cold night. My spirit is freezing to ice in this heat</segment1>
		<segment2>Could you turn around and say. Hooray, it's a beautiful day L.A.. But now is the time. To pack your bags and go. Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.. But I think I'll be gone today</segment2>
		<segment3>I've been traveling at the speed of gasoline. And stopped by the color of electricity. We've been trying for too long. To cover up His fingerprints. From a distant past. And it's a dark cold right now. My spirit is freezing to ice in this heat</segment3>
		<segment4>Could you turn around and say. Hooray, it's a beautiful day L.A.. But now is the time. To pack your bags and go. Hooray it's a beautiful day L.A.. But I think I'll be gone today</segment4>
		<segment5>And it's a damned cold night now. My spirit is freezing to ice in this heat.
