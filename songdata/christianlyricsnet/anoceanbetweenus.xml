		<segment1>How many years have we waited. for a ship that never set sail?. And how many days have we wasted. chasing a love that was not our own?. I sat ashore and watched. as one hopeless wave crashed upon another. while my thoughts ran to the hills. my heart never reached the sea. with only delusions of an endless journey. I am left with an ocean between you and me</segment1>
		<segment2>Is this your salvation?. Is this all you can give?. I will not stand in reflection. of someone else's dream</segment2>
		<segment3>The gate to my heart has been weld shut. with the splendor of my aspirations closed in. how many years have we waited. for a ship that never set sail?. And how many days have we wasted. chasing a love that was not our own?</segment3>
		<segment4>Is this your salvation?. Is this all you can give?. I will not stand in reflection. of someone else's dream    </segment4>
