		<segment1>Even before there was a drop in the ocean. Even before there was a star in the sky. Even before the world was put in motion. You were on Your throne. You were on Your throne</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. You reign. Glory in the highest. You reign. Let creation testify. By Your name. Every knee will bow. And every tongue proclaim. That Jesus reigns</segment2>
		<segment3>Verse 2. Even before Your hand made the heavens. Even before the breath of all mankind. Even before we had to be forgiven. You were on Your throne. You were on Your throne</segment3>
