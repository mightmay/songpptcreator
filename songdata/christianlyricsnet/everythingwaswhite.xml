		<segment1>As I clear my mind enough to see. Decaying pieces of my being that have fallen on me. I find the one clean cut that has given the wrath. Beneath the deep and cleansing fire that is shaping the path. I've had all my life to fall in place. I watch all my past in right decay. And with every step that shames my face. I see all my pieces catch ablaze. . CHORUS: The pain is fading, now you're leaving me alone. I can't stop bleeding, I'm depleting on my own. . I can't bury every form I've seen. The hollow pieces of perfection are embedded in me. And with every step the walls give way. And in the shadow of deceit I can see you fade. I've seen all those dreams we try to hide. And the sound of honesty's reply. But I'm not that man you've seen inside. He was born so pure but then he died. . (CHORUS). . With every word I breathe out. I feel it escaping from my soul. With every thought created. Omission leaving me so cold. . I've seen inside the downward fall. Remember all the filth I saw. I've seen inside the downward fall. Remember everything I saw. . (CHORUS).     </segment1>
