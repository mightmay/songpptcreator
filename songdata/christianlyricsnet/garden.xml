		<segment1>standing over my garden i look down. and disappointment overcomes me. the tears that formed are. now falling from my eyes. and watering the ground around me. lost inside this dissolution. i hear You say my name</segment1>
		<segment2>i hear You calling. i hear You calling to me. i hear You calling</segment2>
		<segment3>faith, like a flower, needs water and room to grow. placed in sunlight, not in shadow. hope that the seed that is. hidden will rise and bloom. from the heart of one forgiven. love runs in the Living Water. i've heard You say my name    </segment3>
