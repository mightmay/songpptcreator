		<segment1>i've never any time to play. i always seems to slip away. but it never really goes by. while i wait here with my lullaby. for our only try</segment1>
		<segment2>sing with your head up. with your eyes closed. not because you love the song. because you love to sing. because you love to sing, oh</segment2>
		<segment3>you saw this frustration on my brow. you noticed i'm distracted now. i'm thinking only of my bill fold. and how I want to face you with. diamonds and gold in my head, in my head</segment3>
		<segment4>sing with your head up. with your eyes closed. not because you love the song. because you love to sing. because you love to sing, oh    </segment4>
