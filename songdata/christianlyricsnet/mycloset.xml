		<segment1>I love you so much, dear God. your praise is on my lips. I failed you, I did wrong and still you give me a chance. That's why I say Jesus &quot;I love you man&quot;. Your majesty, father, friend I put you on a cross and you bleed for me. I shut the door in your face but you kept knocking. You've kept me alive long enouph to relize the truth. So every step I take I'll be with you. You've put my feet upon the rock. You've never let me down. I'm so happy to be at your feet on the ground. I love you so much, God this you now. I will never let the rooster crow. I will fight the good fight for you my friend. Never will I be in sin again. You mean so much you mean everything. I overcome the devil because you are there with me. Father, how I love you in everyway. So father. How can I bless you today. I love you so much I'll will never get bored. As for me and this house we will serve the Lord God. I've beat you in the face. And my soul's forgiven Your glorified    </segment1>
