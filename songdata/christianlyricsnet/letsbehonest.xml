		<segment1>I sing because I don't know what to do. It's taken me a long time, to find that life is passing by</segment1>
		<segment2>I lift my hands, I'm so desperate to feel Him. So let's be honest, without Him life just passes by</segment2>
		<segment3>Slow down, we're slowly dying. But we can live again. Be lifted up in Him</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm dead because I want to live in Jesus. But one day I will rise up. I'll try to show you who He is</segment4>
		<segment5>Slow down, we're slowly dying. But we can live again. Be lifted up in Him</segment5>
		<segment6>His blood flows down to cause my innocence. It comes from innocence, and it carries on to me. And it flows down to cause my innocence. Because He's innocent, He gave himself for me, for me.. </segment6>
		<segment7>Slow down, we're slowly dying. But we can live again. Be lifted up in Him</segment7>
		<segment8>Slow down.. Slow down, we're slowly dying. Slow down.. But we can live again. Be lifted up in Him    </segment8>
