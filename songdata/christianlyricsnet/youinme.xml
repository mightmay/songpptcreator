		<segment1>Up tight, down right. Wound up like a spring. Funny how I worry 'bout what just don't mean a thing. But then that's when. You speak Your truth to me. You say things aren't what they seem. This life's not what it seems. And it changes</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm in less of a hurry. I'm less likely to worry. When in my heart I receive. Thoughts of my eternal destiny. I've given up frustration. Trust You with out hesitation. But my mind just can't conceive. That it must be the You in me Lord</segment2>
		<segment3>I tried till I cried. To bring about some change. But in spite of all the work. My efforts were in vain. I guess for this mess. I'm the one to blame. Cause when I'm trusting You. My life's just not the same. I'm different now</segment3>
		<segment4>No matter what my present situation. I need to give it all to You    </segment4>
