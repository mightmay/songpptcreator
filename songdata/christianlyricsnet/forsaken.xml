		<segment1>I've looked straight into your eyes. And turned my head for the last time. Because I was scared to leave these walls in ruin. Like the fate of those who trust in themselves</segment1>
		<segment2>We are alone and afraid</segment2>
		<segment3>I know you are the one we left behind. Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone. you are the one we left behind. you are the one we left be..</segment3>
		<segment4>I will no longer turn my head. I will never forget you. You are the one we left behind. You are the forsaken</segment4>
		<segment5>We've built our confidence. On broken dreams now left for dead. Yet we've been condemned. To chase these dreams that never end</segment5>
		<segment6>I know you are the one we left behind. Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone. you are the one we left behind. you are the one we left be..</segment6>
		<segment7>I will no longer turn my head. I will never forget you. You are the one we left behind. You are the forsaken</segment7>
		<segment8>I will no longer turn my head. I will never forget you. You are the one we left behind. You are the forsaken</segment8>
		<segment9>Our selfishness consumes us. Until the whole world is not enough. Forgive the day that I erased your name. that I erased your name. For it's the memory of me that will decay</segment9>
		<segment10>I know you are the forsaken. Yet somehow we are the ones who feel alone. I know you are the forsaken. Yet somehow we are the ones who feel alone.     </segment10>
