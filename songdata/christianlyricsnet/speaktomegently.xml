		<segment1>Sadness and rhyme. These are the times. These are the memories. We find a way. Pushing through the day </segment1>
		<segment2>So speak to me gently. Can you just feel the time. Falling from some place new?. Can you just feel the sign?. Love waits for you. Love waits for you </segment2>
		<segment3>I'm searching the stars. In desperate hours. Bound to find meaning. God shows a face. In this desolate place. And tenderness meets me </segment3>
		<segment4>Stories untold. Of redwoods grown old. Reside in the forest. And there you can hear. A whispering tear. That speaks into our loneliness.     </segment4>
