		<segment1>Artist:	Audio Adrenaline. Album:	Some Kind Of Zombie. Song:	New Body</segment1>
		<segment2>Never been accused, or been confused. with a model on a cover page. Never could've been a superstar in the NBA. Can't run that fast, never could. breakdance, can't jump a building in a single bound. Anticipate, can't wait till I hear that sound.</segment2>
		<segment3>The sky splits, I'm moving, I let it freely take me. This must be the moment, God picked. to rearrange me.</segment3>
		<segment4>You and I, want a new body. You and I, want to fly.</segment4>
		<segment5>Crutches left upon the ground, bodyparts lost are found, everybody. gets to walk today. No more tears and we will feel no pain.</segment5>
		<segment6>The sky splits, I'm. moving. I let it freely take me. this must be the moment, God picked to rearrange me.</segment6>
		<segment7>You and I, want a new body. You and I, want to fly. You and I, can get a new body. You and I, will never, never die</segment7>
		<segment8>Never gonna die. I'm gonna fly. Never gonna die. I'm gonna fly</segment8>
		<segment9>You and I, want a new body. You and I, are gonna fly. You and I, can get a new body. You and I will never, never die</segment9>
		<segment10>The sky splits, I'm moving. I let it freely take me. this must be the moment. God chose to rearrange me.    </segment10>
