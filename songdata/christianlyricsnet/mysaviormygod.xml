		<segment1>I am not skilled to understand. What God has willed, what God has planned. I only know at His right hand. Stands one who is my Savior </segment1>
		<segment2>I take Him at His word and deed. Christ died to save me; this I read. And in my heart I find a need. Of Him to be my savior</segment2>
		<segment3>That He would leave His place on high. And come for sinful man to die. You count it strange, so once did I. Before I knew my Savior </segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus (2x's). My Savior loves, My Savior lives. My Savior's always there for me. My God: He was, my God; He is. My God is always gonna be</segment4>
		<segment5>Yes, living, dying, let me bring. My strength, my solace from this spring;. That He who lives to be my King. Once died to be my Savior</segment5>
		<segment6>That He would leave His place on high. And come for sinful man to die. You count it strange, so once did I. Before I knew my Savior</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus (2x's) </segment7>
		<segment8>(Instrumental)</segment8>
		<segment9>Chorus: (2x's)</segment9>
		<segment10>My Savior loves, My Savior lives. My Savior loves, My Savior lives.     </segment10>
