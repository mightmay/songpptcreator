		<segment1>We've been here far too long. And everything's gone wrong</segment1>
		<segment2>Shake it off, shake it off. We can talk this through. Just wait it out, wait it out. Let in something new. Had you been waiting long. To tell us you were gone. You'll be gone for so long</segment2>
		<segment3>We've been here far too long. And everything's gone wrong. Just say goodbye and show some bravery. Just say goodbye, try not to make a scene</segment3>
		<segment4>Just speak your mind. Speak your mind to cut this tension through. Let it out, let it out. Let's hear what's best for you. Had you been waiting long. To tell us you were gone for so long</segment4>
		<segment5>We know, nothing ever stays the same. We know how to deal with change. We know all about it    </segment5>
