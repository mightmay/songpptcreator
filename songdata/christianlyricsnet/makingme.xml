		<segment1>Well the poet is stuck in the mud. And the dreamer is finding his way home from the stars. And the visionary's watching his feet. 'Cause the sentimental fool is numb again</segment1>
		<segment2>Simple hand, simple eye, nothing to write home about. Yet the artist chisels at the stone. Curious, the child tugs the fingers of the bigger. He wants to see the face that is his own. He's not alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord Help me be the one You're making me, yeah. Lord help me see the one You're making me. The one You're making me, the one You're making me</segment3>
		<segment4>Well we push it off and pull Him in. We fist His lips and we kick His shin. We post a sign, turn and throttle away. And barely listen to a single word He has to say. By his eye a tendril fell. He cast a word, but not a spell. It's all tied up it's all done. I was a cancer, but you have made me a son</segment4>
		<segment5>Lord Help me be the one You're making me, yeah. Lord help me see the one You're making me. The one You're making me, the one You're making me</segment5>
		<segment6>I feel the wild whims of the wicked as I wonder whether. Ashes burn twice or these thoughts be put under a fire. To be burned as I have tried to learn. from the whisper of His will. While I am standing still. And the night fell fast, I crashed. and blast my prayers like through a megaphone. Aimed all of my feelings at the ceiling. Cuz I want to know who I am. And if I really have a Home</segment6>
		<segment7>Lord Help me be the one You're making me, yeah. Lord help me see the one You're making me. The one You're making me, the one You're making me    </segment7>
