		<segment1>By the waters of Babylon. Still and deep. The sun rose at midnight. I was not asleep. I saw a man with a javelin. A carriage of steel. His eyes burned like sapphires. Wheels turning in wheels </segment1>
		<segment2>I saw aluminum angels. Arrayed like a choir. Hailstones falling. Rivers of fire. By the waters of Babylon. I sank down in shame. Covered in ashes. I called out your name </segment2>
		<segment3>Oh Jerusalem. City of thrones. The blood of your people. Still darkens the stones. City of sorrows. Spread on a hill. Bride of the prophets. They dream of you still </segment3>
		<segment4>Kings in their armor. Swords in the sky. Storefronts of martyrs. Lined up to die. While in the streets of Jerusalem. Children in pain. Covered in ashes. I called out your name </segment4>
		<segment5>Oh Jerusalem. City of thrones. The blood of your people. Still darkens the stones. City of sorrows. Spread on a hill. Bride of the prophets. They dream of you still </segment5>
		<segment6>Oh Jerusalem. City of thrones. The blood of your people. Still darkens the stones. City of sorrows. Spread on a hill. Bride of the prophets. They dream of you still    </segment6>
