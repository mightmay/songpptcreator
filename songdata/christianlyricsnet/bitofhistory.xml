		<segment1>I've never been able to make you believe in me, You have always been too wrapped up to see, How am I to make you understand?. How am I to make you understand that I can do anything that he could want out of me?. Now I am gonna be the leader he wants me to be, Maybe I should help you understand, Maybe you should let me help you understand, And I know it's our turn, It's time to do this on our own.</segment1>
		<segment2>And we've been saying it all along, And now you're staring in from the outside.</segment2>
		<segment3>There was nothing we could do to convince you to stay, 'Cause you had made up your mind you were walking away, How am I to make you understand?. How am I to make you understand?. We were gonna do whatever we thought it would take, as long as it was a decision he told us to make, Maybe I should help you understand, Maybe you should let me help you understand, And I know it's our turn, It's time to do this on our own.</segment3>
		<segment4>And we've been saying it all along, And now you're staring in from the outside, You thought you we're safe, but you were wrong, And now you're the one being outside.</segment4>
		<segment5>Is it cold out there, where you're all alone?. But you could come back inside if it weren't for your pride, Just let it go, just let it go.</segment5>
		<segment6>And we've been saying you were wrong, We've been saying you were wrong, We've been saying you were wrong, We've been saying you were wrong.</segment6>
		<segment7>And we've been saying it all along, And now you're staring in from the outside, (from outside). You thought you we're safe, but you were wrong, And now you're the one being outside. (outside, oh)    </segment7>
