		<segment1>Oh my security. Wrapped up like knots inside of me. Am I ever coming clean?. I see the sorrow in your eyes. Your smile is a very sad disguise. I cannot play that game tonight</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Dont ya know?. We all have a secret, We have friends, who try to keep them, Im just a skeleton without you now.</segment2>
		<segment3>My own imprisonment, just like the Skelton inside. I know the truth will set me free. Locked in my Secrecy, I cant comfy to me. Show me a cure for my disease.</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus). Dont ya know?. We all have a secret. We have friends who try to keep them. Dont ya know your sins will find you out. Im a man, a man with a problem, I need you around so I can solve them. Im just a skeleton without you now.</segment4>
		<segment5>. Ive been running in circles around my head. To scared to tell you who I am. Like a heartless Skeleton.</segment5>
		<segment6>. Dont ya know?. We all have a secret. We have friends who try to keep them. Dont ya know your sins will find you out. Im a man, a man with a problem, I need you around so I can solve them, Im just a skeleton without you now!!!!. (I want to be no Skeleton!). (I want to be no Skeleton!). (I want to be no Skeleton!). (I want to be no Skeleton!). You now!!!. (I want to be no Skeleton!). (I want to be no Skeleton!). You now!!. (I want to be no Skeleton!). (I want to be no Skeleton!)    </segment6>
