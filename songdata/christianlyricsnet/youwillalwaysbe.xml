		<segment1>Kingdoms rise and kingdoms fall. But You go on and on. Hard times come but You remain. The fortress through the storm </segment1>
		<segment2>You will always be. Never failing King. Just and faithful, always able. You will always be </segment2>
		<segment3>Years will come and days will go. But You will never fade. Things on earth will let me down. But You will never fail </segment3>
		<segment4>My eyes may look away from You. But You will never leave. Times I've turned and run from. You Your love has stayed by me     </segment4>
