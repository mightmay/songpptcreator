		<segment1>Is the face that I see in the mirror. the one I want others to see. Do I show in the way that I walk in my life. The love that You've given to me. My heart's desire is to be like You. In all that I do, all I am</segment1>
		<segment2>Do they see Jesus In Me. Do they recognize Your face. Do I communicate Your love, and Your grace. Do I reflect who You are. In the way I choose to be. Do they see Jesus In Me</segment2>
		<segment3>It's amazing that you'd ever use me. But use me the way You will. Help me to hold out a heart of. compassionate grace. A heart that You're spirit fills. May I show forgiveness and mercy. The same way You've shown it to me</segment3>
		<segment4>Now I want to show all the world who You are. The reason I live and breathe. So You'll be the One that they see. When they see me    </segment4>
