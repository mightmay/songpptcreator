		<segment1>When peace like a river. Attendeth my way. When sorrows like the sea billows roll</segment1>
		<segment2>Whatever my lot. Thou hast taught me to say. It is well. It is well with my soul</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). It is well. With my soul. It is well. It is well with my soul</segment3>
		<segment4>My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!. My sin, not in part but the whole, yeah. Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)</segment5>
		<segment6>And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be saved. The clouds be rolled back as a scroll. The trumphed shall resound. And the Lord shall descend even so. It is well with my soul</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus)    </segment7>
