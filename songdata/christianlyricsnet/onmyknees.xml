		<segment1>There are days, When I feel. The best of me. Is ready to begin. Then they're days, When I feel. I'm letting go, And soaring on the wind. But I've learned in laughter or in pain, How to survive</segment1>
		<segment2>I get on my knees. I get on my knees. there I am before the Love that. Changes me. See, I don't know how, But there's power. when Im on my knees</segment2>
		<segment3>I can be in a crowd, or by myself. or almost anywhere, when I feel, there's a need. to talk with God, he is Emmanuel, when I close my eyes, no darkness there. there's only light</segment3>
		<segment4>When I get on my knees. When I get on my knees. there I am before the Love that changes me. see I don't know how, but there's power. in the blue sky. I don't know how but there's power. and in the midnight. and I don't know how but there's power. when Im on my knees. I get on my knees. I get on my knees. and there I am before the Love that changes me. I don't know how, but there's power. I don't know how but God gives me power. I don't know how but there's power. When I'm on my knees. A la la la. A la la la la la. A la la la. A la la la la la. A la la la. A la la la la la     </segment4>
