		<segment1>Its the way of the world (oh.) </segment1>
		<segment2>Who He is, Who I'am, how we move. It's a wild ride, a frenzy. I could catch my breath to stop and see. What, I feel inside - is this happy?. Whats going on all around me?. I just can't work it out, exactly. It all comes down so abstractly </segment2>
		<segment3>(chorus). It's the way of the world of you and me. It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might. It's the way of the world of you and me. And all I know is I love the way I feel. It's the way of the world Oh.. </segment3>
		<segment4>What does it mean? Scattered, crazy, suddenly. I'm lost in you, I've got to be. Spinning and flashing and dashing. With every turn I'm taking. It's heaven in the making. The moments race right past me. Sometimes i just burst out laughing </segment4>
		<segment5>(chorus). It's the way of the world of you and me. It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might. It's the way of the world of you and me. And all I know is I love the way I feel. It's the way of the world Oh.. </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm thinking to myself. Where did I go?. All I know is that. I'm somewhere else. Lost in a mystery. In another world. There's nowhere else I'd rather be </segment6>
		<segment7>It's the way of the world. It's wish I ever made or ever thought i might. It's the way of the world Oh.. And all I know is I love the way i feel. the way I feel....Oh... Its' the way of the world of you and me. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </segment7>
		<segment8>(chorus). It's the way of the world of you and me. It's every wish I ever made or ever thought I might. It's the way of the world of you and me. And all I know is I love the way I feel. It's the way of the world Oh.. </segment8>
		<segment9>It's the way of the world of you and me    </segment9>
