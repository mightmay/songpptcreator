		<segment1>You didn't have to be so mean to me. I guess now I see how it's gonna be. I'm joining GSF, I've made up my mind. Forget this thing called love, it's a waste of time. Girls ain't no good anymore, anyway!. Not for one second have I understood. Why they do what they do, why they say what they say. Always happens to my friends, it always happens to me. It's taken me 19 years to finally see. She said &quot;Can we just be friends?. It's just not working out.&quot;. Another broken heart that I can do without. Girls ain't no good anymore, anyway!. Not for one second have I understood. Why they do what they do, why they say what they say    </segment1>
