		<segment1>Lord You found me. so lost in a desolate place. now I feel Your love around me. and I wanna serve You all my days. I surrender my spirit and mind Lord to You. my body and soul to Your kingdom. forever I want to be true. Lord to You. Your peace it floods my soul. it's supernatural. Your amazing love is unconditional. and Your joy it overflows. it's supernatural. and Your love for me is unconditional, unconditional. sweet assurance. the mercy of God will endure. no matter what happens here on earth. Lord I trust You. to move in miraculous ways. now I feel Your arms around me. and i want to serve You all my days. and give You praise    </segment1>
