		<segment1>New boy in the neighborhood. Lives down stairs and it's understood. He's there just to take good care of me. Like he's one of the family.</segment1>
		<segment2>Charles in charge of. Our days and our nights. Charles in charge of. Our wrongs and our rights. So I say. I want Charles in charge of me.</segment2>
		<segment3>Charles, I love you, Love you till the end. And I love Buddy, Cause he's your best friend. Let's go hang out, You me and Jesus at your mom's pizza parlor. And maybe you can hook me up. With the girl that's from Baywatch. And on your show.    </segment3>
