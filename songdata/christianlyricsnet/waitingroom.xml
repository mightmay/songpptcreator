		<segment1>Here in this waiting room yearning for You to say go. And though Im convinced that a yes would be best. This time Youre telling me no</segment1>
		<segment2>Its not that I dont have an answer. Its just not the one that Id like. But through this time Lord I must keep in mind. Youre always wiser than I</segment2>
		<segment3>You have a much better purpose. And You have a far greater plan. And You have a bigger perspective. Cause You hold this world in your hands</segment3>
		<segment4>The things that I seek are from You. Like the strong healing touch of your hand. But when You say no help me trust even though. Theres a reason I cant understand</segment4>
		<segment5>When that miracle comes cause Your answer is yes. I will praise you for all of my days. But when Your wisdom declares that a no is best. I will praise You just the same    </segment5>
