		<segment1>One of these days we all stand in judgment for every single word that we have spoken. One of these days we all will stand before the Lord. Give a reason for everything weve done and what weve done is. TRUST IN JESUS - MY GREAT DELIVERER - MY STRONG DEFENDER. The Son of God - I trust in Jesus  blesses redeemer  my Lord forever. The Holy one - the Holy one. What are you going to do, when your time has come, and your life is done?. And theres nothing you can stand on, what will you have to say at the judgment throne. I already know the only thing that I can say I. Theres nothing I can do on my own to find forgiveness. It by His grace alone I trust in Jesus - trust in Jesus    </segment1>
