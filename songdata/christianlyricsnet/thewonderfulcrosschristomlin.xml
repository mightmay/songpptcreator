		<segment1>When I survey the wondrous cross. On which the Prince of Glory died. My richest gain I count but loss. And pour contempt on all my pride</segment1>
		<segment2>See from his head, his hands, his feet. Sorrow and love flow mingled down. Did ever such love and sorrow meet. Or thorns compose so rich a crown</segment2>
		<segment3>O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross. Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live. O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross. All who gather here by grace draw near and bless. Your name</segment3>
