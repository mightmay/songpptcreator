		<segment1>as I recall when my stomach turned. and I was hiding away from myself. away from you. like nothing but something was terribly wrong. and I admit that I was only waiting for the right time (right time). right moment for you to look away. though you never did I pretended for a while. so I could walk where I don't belong </segment1>
		<segment2>I remember every word you said. come back in time come back. and I remember I was too beaten. pitiful so pitiful </segment2>
		<segment3>but I know as they hammered those nails. into your beautiful hands. your eyes they tried to search for mine. but I look away. now your eyes are the only thing that can save me. I'm still afraid of them piercin'. you break into my prison. just pretended for a while. my soul is sad and I walk away </segment3>
		<segment4>I remember every word you said. come back in time come back. and I remember I was too beaten. pitiful so pitiful </segment4>
		<segment5>pitiful. pitiful. pitiful. pitiful. so pitiful </segment5>
		<segment6>and I remember every word you said. but this time I won't look away. and I remember every word you said. and this time I won't look away </segment6>
		<segment7>and I remember every word you said. come back in time come back. and I remember I was so beaten. pitiful so pitiful </segment7>
		<segment8>and I remember every word you said (pitiful). come back in time come back (pitiful). and I remember I was too beaten (pitiful). pitiful so pitiful    </segment8>
