		<segment1>Grey's my favorite color. Black and white has never been my thing. I'll take my drink lukewarm now. Hot and cold is not the thing for me</segment1>
		<segment2>Absolutes are hidden. I've buried my convictions</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. I cannot be blind no more. Numb to what I'm living for. Help me stop this compromise that justifies these lies. I need Your passion in this life</segment3>
		<segment4>I don't want to impose. Who really needs to know what I believe. Cause no one likes rockin' boats. And who would care to see the way I see</segment4>
		<segment5>So give me the fire, yeah. God give me Your fire. And raise this life higher    </segment5>
