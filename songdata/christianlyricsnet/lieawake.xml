		<segment1>I am the wind in the barren land of emptiness and pain. I am the answer to the questions of the lost and dying. Lie awake, the night is swiftly falling. Lie awake, the end is coming, the end is coming soon!. I am the light that illuminates your dark and empty soul. I am the Lamb who has given all and suffered for your sins. I am the lion who in judgement stands and conquers all!. Lie awake, the night is swiftly falling. Lie awake, the end is coming, the end is coming soon!    </segment1>
