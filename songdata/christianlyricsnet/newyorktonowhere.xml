		<segment1>Going nowhere fast, watching cars go past. Why won't the snow melt faster?. This trip is a disaster. 16 hour drive, just played in some dive. New York to nowhere, we're never gonna get there </segment1>
		<segment2>A million miles away from everyone I know. Stuck here night and day with 5 more days to go    </segment2>
