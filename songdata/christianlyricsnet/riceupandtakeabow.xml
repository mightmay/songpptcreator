		<segment1>Crying late nights in your pillow. And you wonder why. Your heart's broken. A small token. Smoke screen for a lie</segment1>
		<segment2>So rise up and take a bow. You say that you've got got good reason now. Rise up and take a bow. Trouper light of pity are on you now</segment2>
		<segment3>So act like a heart-broken fool. Breakin' all the rules. Using your hurt as a license. You say it can't be your fault. For crying tears of salt. That seem to be loosing their savor now. Cause you've broken your vow. And your feelings are more important. You've broken it now just a useless vow. Trampled in the dust by your own choice</segment3>
		<segment4>So rise up and take a bow. You say that you've got got good reason now. Rise up and take a bow. Trouper light of pity are on you now</segment4>
		<segment5>Crying late nights in your pillow. And you wonder why. Your heart's broken. A small token. Smoke screen for a lie</segment5>
		<segment6/>
		<segment7>&quot;So guard yourself in your spirit, and do not break faith with the wife of your youth. 'I hate divorce' says the Lord God of Israel&quot;. Malachi 2:15 &amp; 16 NIV    </segment7>
