		<segment1>It's two 'o clock your time, midnight mine. And I could die to have you here</segment1>
		<segment2>Call you up, I'm far away. Wake you up, but it's ok. You don't mind. I'm not scared to say it now. It's not fair and yet somehow. We're doing fine</segment2>
		<segment3>It's two 'o clock your time, midnight mine. And I could die to have you here</segment3>
		<segment4>Watch the changing leaves again. But I don't remember when. We saw them fall. When the snowflake covers blue. I will come back home to you. And watch them all</segment4>
		<segment5>It's two 'o clock your time, midnight mine. And I could die to have you here</segment5>
		<segment6>Every time you're on my mind. It just seems to unwind</segment6>
		<segment7>It's two 'o clock your time, midnight mine. And I could die to have you here </segment7>
		<segment8>    </segment8>
