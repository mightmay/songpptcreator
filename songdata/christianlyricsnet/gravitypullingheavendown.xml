		<segment1>Whats love without a heart that it can teach. Whats war without a cause. Whats hope without humanity in need. Whats a win without a loss. I know, I know we fight against gravity. But gravitys no enemy. Yes, I know, I know we fight against gravity. But gravity is what we need</segment1>
		<segment2>(Chorus). Its pulling Heaven down, down, down. Its pulling Heaven down, down, down. How could it be the gravity that holds me to the ground. Is pulling Heaven down, down, down</segment2>
		<segment3>Whats free if theres no chains to be found. Whats death without a cost. Whats truth if we keep it out of reach. Whos Christ without a cross. I know, I know we fight against gravity. But gravitys no enemy. No, I know, I know we fight against gravity. But gravity is what we need</segment3>
		<segment4>Gravity found us a Savior. Put Him on Earth so He could save us. No love, no force is greater. Heaven meets Earth, thats the gravity of love</segment4>
		<segment5>Pulling Heaven down so look up theres a change in the wind. A revolution is about to begin, love wins. Yeah, Im talking about a holy visitation. For God to come and visit, this nations patiently waiting. For Him to move like He said He would move. Ready for God to do anything that He wants to. The time is now to pull, if you ask me, Im not afraid of gravity Its pulling Heaven down    </segment5>
