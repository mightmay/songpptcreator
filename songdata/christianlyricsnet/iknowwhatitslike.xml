		<segment1>I know what its like to be mocked and scolded . I know what its like to be made fun of . I know what its like to be from the wrong side of town . I know, oh I know. . I know what its like to be betrayed by your friends . I know what its like to have to run and hide . I know what its like to be like you . To be like you . . So just hold on Im coming soon . To take you home, take you home . Oh its so delightful but between now and then . I have given to you my word . For a promise in truth . Just have faith that Ill lead and guide you to a life of peace . To a life of peace . . I know what its like to have pressure all around me . I know what its like to have anxiety . I know what its like to pray and feel like youre not heard . I know, oh I know . . I know what its like to be beaten and bruised . I know what its like to hang on a cross . I know what its like to die for you . I know, oh I know what its like to be like all of you . Like all of you . . So just hold on Im coming soon . To take you home, take you home . Oh its so delightful but between now and then . I have given to you my word . For a promise in truth . Just have faith that Ill lead and guide you to a life of peace . To a life of peace . . So I give my life to you Lord . In full recognition of your grace . And I thank you for what you went through just to show me how much you love me . Oh Lord you show me how much you love me . Oh Lord you show me how much you love me      </segment1>
