		<segment1>My heart is giving up. All my plans are broken. Your face is all I see. Though my world is falling. As I watch you head into the sun. I never thought it was my one. Chance to say goodbye. I never want to say goodbye</segment1>
		<segment2>Life is sweeter, sweeter. On the other side, on the other side. I will see you, see you. On the other side, on the other side. Ill find the stars to light me through. Ill find a way to get to you. Life is sweeter on the other side of here</segment2>
		<segment3>So far from where you are. But I feel you with me. Your in the place where I belong. Where my life is waiting. As I watch the rising of the sun. I pray that I could have just one. Chance to say goodnight. I never want to say goodbye</segment3>
		<segment4>Life is sweeter, sweeter. On the other side, on the other side. I will see you, see you. On the other side, on the other side. Ill find the stars to light me through. Ill find a way to get to you. Life is sweeter on the other side of here</segment4>
		<segment5>Everyday I get a little bit closer. To reaching you. But I cant wait, till Im with you forever. Everyday I get a little bit closer. To reaching you. But I cant wait till I hold you forever</segment5>
		<segment6>Life is sweeter, sweeter. On the other side, on the other side. I will see you, see you. On the other side, on the other side. Ill find the stars to light me through. Ill find a way to get to you. Life is sweeter on the other side of here. On the other side of here.     </segment6>
