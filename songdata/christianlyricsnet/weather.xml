		<segment1>race through town at the speed of sound. we've got &quot;combat rock&quot; on the radio. wind blowin rain or snowin well just goin. going to the break of dawn. theres something in the weather that keeps us together. something in the weather. we're just hangin around no where bound. we've been lost and found in this boring town.    </segment1>
