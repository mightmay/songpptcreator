		<segment1>I've heard all you're gonna say this time. I guess I've kind of lost my mind. I'll try to decide where to go from here. Someone must have left, turned out the light. My brain isn't working well tonight. Where should I go from here?. I'm gonna try..To do it right..I'm gonna try let's go!. Am I gonna make it through today?. Please help me make it through today. By now all security seems gone. But that's ok it wont be for long. I know I'll find my way, it just might not be today. It seems scary but I'll love it every day. There wont be anything standing in my way. Where do I go from here?. I'm gonna try..To do it right..I'm gonna try..let's go!. I'm gonna make it through today?. With your help I'll make it through today. I know I'll make it through today. I'm gonna make it through today. Looking at the whole picture now, can be nerve wracking at times. Just take it all one day at a time. Sometimes I'll sit and think to much. But it never gets me anywhere. Results come from action. So you've got to get out of your seat. You've got to go and try. You've got to go and try. I'm gonna try..To do it right..I'm gonna try..let's go!. I'm gonna make it through today?. With your help I'll make it through today. I know I'll make it through today.
