		<segment1>You are justice for every oppression. You're forgiveness for every confession. You are beauty, goodness, blessing. You are love</segment1>
		<segment2>You are healing for every sickness. You are power in every weakness. You are mighty, holy, faithful, You are love</segment2>
		<segment3>O God of the Heavens. You descended from your throne. Gave Your Son for our ransom. And by this all men will know that You are love.</segment3>
		<segment4>We were thirsty, you gave us water. We were orphans, now you are our Father. We were desperate, hungry, seeking. You are love</segment4>
		<segment5>[Bridge:]. Everlasting, Never ending. All consuming, You are love    </segment5>
