		<segment1>If you see a change in me don't wonder. There's someone in my life, a peace I can't describe. For I've been reborn. If you see a change in me don't wonder. I found a whole new life. A hope that I can't hide. For I've been reborn </segment1>
		<segment2>Have you ever felt. A longing, a searching within your soul for something more. But you don't know what for. There's One who will reach across the distance. From the heavens to the earth. Because He loves you. He loves you </segment2>
		<segment3>If you see a change in me don't wonder. There's someone in my life, a peace I can't describe. For I've been reborn. If you see a change in me don't wonder. I found a whole new life. A hope that I can't hide. For I've been reborn </segment3>
		<segment4>If you see a change in me (X4) </segment4>
		<segment5>Have you ever felt. That something's missing within your soul. You want something more. But you don't know what for. There is only One you need. But you've got to believe that he loves you. Enough to give His life </segment5>
		<segment6>. If you see a change in me don't wonder. There's someone in my life, a peace I can't describe. For I've been reborn. If you see a change in me don't wonder. I found a whole new life. A hope that I can't hide. For I've been reborn.     </segment6>
