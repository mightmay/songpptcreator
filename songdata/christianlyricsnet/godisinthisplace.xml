		<segment1>Chorus. I need to say. That God is in this place. And God is right by your side. You need to know. That anywhere you go. Just by faith His love will abide</segment1>
		<segment2>The moment could be. Here and now. When you need. Someone to be there. I'm telling you He's reaching out. With love beyond compare. And He knows your soul. And He knows your heart. Knows everything you are</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus)</segment3>
		<segment4>Everyone stumbles (Everybody stumbles). Gets lost along the way. But His mercy comes raining down. With His amazing grace. 'Cause all that you need. Is just to believe. He's waiting to set you free</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus)    </segment5>
