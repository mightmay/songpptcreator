		<segment1>LED LIKE A LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER. In silence and shame, There on Your back You carried a world. Of violence and pain. Bleeding, dying, bleeding, dying.</segment1>
		<segment2>You're alive, You're alive, You have risen, Alleluia!. And the power and the glory is given, Alleluia, Jesus, to You.</segment2>
		<segment3>At break of dawn, poor Mary, Still weeping she came, When through her grief she heard Yourvoice. Now speaking her name. Mary, Master, Mary, Master!</segment3>
		<segment4>At the right hand of the Father. Now seated on high. You have begun Your eternal reign. Of justice and joy. Glory, glory, glory, glory.</segment4>
