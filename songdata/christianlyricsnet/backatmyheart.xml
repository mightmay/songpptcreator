		<segment1>Strong on the outside. But coming apart at the seams. That's me. Tragically always together. But bruised underneath. That's me. I stand just to stumble. I trip on my pride. Why do I always try to hide</segment1>
		<segment2>Meanwhile back at my heart. I'm desperate for all that You are. See through me and take me apart. Meanwhile back at my soul. Mend me, please make me whole. You know just where to start. Back at my heart, back at my heart</segment2>
		<segment3>Patiently waiting to pick up. The pieces of me. That's You. Healer of hearts. When the world leaves it broken in two. That's You. Maker of heaven. The sky and the sea. When You stretched your arms. You reached for me</segment3>
		<segment4>Meanwhile back at my heart. I'm desperate for all that You are. Undo me and take me apart. Meanwhile back at my soul. Mend me, please make me whole. You know just where to start</segment4>
		<segment5>Back at my heart. Back at my fear. Back at my brokenness. Lord meet me here. I am exposed. And I'm not afraid anymore</segment5>
		<segment6>Meanwhile back at my heart. I'm desperate for all that You are. Undo me and take me apart. Meanwhile back at my soul. Mend me, please make me whole. You know just where to start     </segment6>
