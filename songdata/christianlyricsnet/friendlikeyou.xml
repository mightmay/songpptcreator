		<segment1>I woke up this morning. And looked out my window. I could see the sun shining down on me. It reminded me of You. And of all that You do. And of all the love that You've shown to me </segment1>
		<segment2>Your mercy oh Lord is new every morning. Your wisdom is waiting for me to ask. Though I might stumble. Though I lose my step now. Your grace is gonna cover what I lack </segment2>
		<segment3>Thank You Lord. Oh thank You Lord. I am so thankful for a friend like You </segment3>
		<segment4>Jesus Your love is better than life to me. Your goodness is always by my side. And why you love me is hard for me to see. But I love you Lord cause You've been so good to me </segment4>
		<segment5>Though I may never be a scholar with a fancy degree. One thing I know for sure is that I love You. And You love me Lord    </segment5>
