		<segment1>I've taken every word you say to me with of grain of salt. And it's not just your fault anymore. If you would have thought back way before it all went bad. You might have taken to heart the things we had</segment1>
		<segment2>That's enough from me for a little while. Not that you could see through a sorry smile. And in case you can't tell you've broken this shell of me</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm taking every word you say to me with of grain of salt. Because it's not just my fault anymore. If you would have known me way before it all went bad. You might have taken to thought the things we had</segment3>
		<segment4>That's enough from me for a little while. Not that you could see through a sorry smile. And in case you can't tell you've broken this shell of me</segment4>
		<segment5>If I had a shred of compassion for your aching head, you might feel older. Holding you so dear like angel in the stratosphere could be my only hope    </segment5>
