		<segment1>I'm an outkast. But don't count me out. Underground dwellaz, roaming beneath the cellars. Failed us with this system, ain't living how they tell us. Hideaway place, it's safe, they raise a nation of hate, erase a man for his faith. They feed us lies, dress up my King in false disguise. Behind those eyes, soul of a savior I recognize. No compromise, while the whole world becomes corrupt. Tonight we break the surface for lives, we coming up</segment1>
		<segment2>Brother take my hand. Let's separate ourselves. Leave behind this place. Don't ever look back</segment2>
		<segment3>Disgraced man, survivors of the wasteland, looking for a home of his own. No place to run, no place to hide. It's time for you to stand on your own. Militia, coalition, not of this world. Resistance, we the alliance. We freedom fighters, its honor we defend. We follow truth and never your trends</segment3>
		<segment4>Brother take my hand. Let's separate ourselves. Leave behind this place. Don't ever look back</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm an outkast. But don't count me out</segment5>
		<segment6>Brace yourself like a man.     </segment6>
