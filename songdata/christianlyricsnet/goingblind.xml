		<segment1>She's on a beach in Maui her breasts are half uncovered. I try to stop myself from staring at her butt. I'm drawn like Dagwood to sleep. The lawn may need mowing but still I can't prevent my thoughts. From becoming obscene so I justify, she's only a page in a magazine. She's not real, she doesn't feel. Eyes pierce her scraps of cloth. Her value is lost</segment1>
		<segment2>Crown of all creation, bane of jealous angels. She's nothing more to me than food for a fantasy. And though I know it's a shame, I won't turn away. My thoughts are so casually lead astray. And I know it's not right it feels so unclean. but she's just a page in a magazine. She's not real, she doesn't feel. Eyes pierce her scraps of cloth. Her value is lost. 49er, gold prospector. Her body is my claim. As she assumes some cheesy pose, imagination see's no close. And I don't even know her name. Her body breaks my minds leash like Gus broke his chain    </segment2>
