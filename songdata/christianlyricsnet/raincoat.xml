		<segment1>I'm looking for a friend to hold the door. It's cold outside when I. don't know where to find. A sheltered place secluded from the race. Of this old life. And as I walked out in the. down pour with no raincoat. I was soaked down to the bone from head to toe. Without my raincoat, anywhere I may go. I still get wet somehow. I found that friend, He's with me till the end. He's promised me that he won't forsake His own. And when a promise never ends. It can only mean one thing it's from above. Now I walk out in the down. poor with my raincoat. And after all is said and. done, He's still the One. With my raincoat, anywhere. I may go I know I'm all right    </segment1>
