		<segment1>I lie down, I sleep. When I wake, sustain me. Outkast blast through deception, the tension, your mind collapse. Relapse, the stress of matter, when I shatter like glass. The never seen, the never heard style we bring forth. Can't ignore, the four, ripp'n straight when I take your title. Self, X it out like homicidal. It's vital, to make my flesh be suicidal. We tribal, sing with the Saints, let our spirits fly. Hold down the strong with the power Jah has given I. Break back the chains, release the squeeze off my veins. Empty box, hollow rocks, I knock you out your frame. Shallow grave marks the date, Oh' Babylon the great. Evil virus, be like Cyrus, trample down your gates. We're the ones, the chosen sons. Come out of dark into light, rather fight than run. We came to die for the reasons you put us down. Don't know when, could have then, what's the time, the time is now</segment1>
		<segment2>I lie down, I sleep. When I wake, sustain me</segment2>
		<segment3>Ready, attack, bout' to break you down fast like collision. Religion, take you from vision to flashback. In an instant, calculate precise precision. It's vivid, turn your intimidation to timid. I'm in it, count down to self-destruction. That's word to my mother when you suffer the repercussions. Clear the path, it's the wrath coming through. You ain't got what it takes to make me break. Because I'm harder than you. I'm harder than you. You ain't got what it takes.     </segment3>
