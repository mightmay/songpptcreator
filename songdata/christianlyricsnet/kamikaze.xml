		<segment1>Maybe I can get you in. Spend my time on you again. Leave our tickets, at the door. We're not paying anymore. (Chorus). When it's time to go. I'll meet you in the parking lot. We'll escape, like a Kamikaze. But it's late, and you're tired. but we're safe beneath the summer sky. You and me, we're Kamikaze</segment1>
		<segment2>Just to live is what you want. But the change is what I need. And I'm not wasting another life. We can find somewhere to hide</segment2>
		<segment3>(Chorus). When it's time to go. I'll meet you in the parking lot. We'll escape, like a Kamikaze. But it's late, and you're tired. but we're safe beneath the summer sky. You and me, we're Kamikaze</segment3>
		<segment4>Call me up when you're alone. We can find somewhere to go. We can pick it up again. And we'll see the morning in</segment4>
		<segment5>(Chorus). When it's time to go. I'll meet you in the parking lot. We'll escape, like a Kamikaze. But it's late, and you're tired. but we're safe beneath the summer sky. You and me, we're Kamikaze    </segment5>
