		<segment1>In this place Saw her face. He was more than happier. Made for Him It's a sin. That she was not faithful</segment1>
		<segment2>She couldn't be. Foolishly More unfaithful if she tried. He did not care. Wanted her Despite lies and wandering eyes. He deserves the very best. But he loves her none the less</segment2>
		<segment3>She's forgotten her first love (Maybe one day she'll return). He's forgotten that she ever went away and broke his heart</segment3>
		<segment4>Lavished on Silver, gold, and anything she needed. Wasted thoughts Broken hearts. Love was not acknowledged</segment4>
		<segment5>God only knows. That He has shown her. More love than she deserves. There will come a time. When she will find. That he's not there To give her love. And He'll be gone away From her forever.     </segment5>
