		<segment1>Ive finally realized that all my dreams lost. Were lost because of me. But tonight, I am changing the way things used to be. And all these memories will be erased </segment1>
		<segment2>Breaking away. From everything thats hopeless. The road ahead looks wonderful. Breaking away. From everything thats hopeless. The road ahead looks wonderful today </segment2>
		<segment3>Another day of life. One more chance to live for more than me. Im reaching out to take the hand of Someone I cant see. And all these memories will be erased </segment3>
		<segment4>Tonight will be the night. No more waiting, Ive spent life waiting. Take this heart of mine. No more waiting, I give myself to You.     </segment4>
