		<segment1>She's been told so many differnt things. She just don't know what she believes. It all makes sense at the time. But don't forget that we are blind. When the obvious is real. She still ignores the way she feels. You can run jump sit or stand around. But not for long unless you've found. Jesus Christ, God, Son and Sacrifice. Believe in him, he'll open up your eyes.     </segment1>
