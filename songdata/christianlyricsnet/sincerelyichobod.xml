		<segment1>We once drew. Some lines in black. And right now it's about time. We took them back. So bored of losing ground to the heresy. In our hearts.. </segment1>
		<segment2>With a steady steady hand hand hammer hammer blade blade through your sweaty sweaty skin skin skin. Please don't stay. We're well past asking. This time we'll make it clear. Our point is made. You're no longer welcome here. (But we) wish you well.. With a steady steady hand hand hammer hammer blade blade through your sweaty sweaty skin skin skin </segment2>
		<segment3>Off with your head. We'll take it all back and then some. Never again.. Off with your head. We'll cut out all that's a hindrance. Bleed the old man </segment3>
		<segment4>And just in case you want to protest. Your eviction, imminent. With a rolling head. On the dirty pavement. And just in case you want to contest. Your destruction evident. The decision, permanent. We'll send you out so you'll know that you will find a bright shiny new home on the other side. (Never again. Never again will you) </segment4>
		<segment5>You're no longer welcome here. (But we) Wish you well.. </segment5>
		<segment6>With a steady steady hand hand hammer hammer blade blade through your sweaty sweaty skin skin skin. I know who I am in the depths of. Spirit and truth. I've seen the face of redemption. And He isn't you. I'm through indulging the tastes of. My cruelest nature. So I think this blade better suits you.. </segment6>
		<segment7>Since we're the ones. Who occupy this temple. We'll be the ones. Who'll show you out.     </segment7>
