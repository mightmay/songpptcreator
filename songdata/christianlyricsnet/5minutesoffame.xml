		<segment1>It was a common story, yeah who cares that I changed?. Why are people freaking out?. Maybe I gave in more than I should, maybe I sold out. But the truth was I was really getting nowhere until I woke up and found. That morals can't take you up to the top your standards pull you down</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. Was it worth it what I gave away. For five minutes of fame. Minutes over no one knows my name. I always said the thing that meant the most to me was my very integrity. Who would have thought I'd ever trade it all for popularity. 'Cause the truth is though I've made it to the top I'm anything but satisfied. I gave up the only thing that mattered for this empty life</segment2>
		<segment3>This time I'm saying no. This world will know what I believe in. I've lost enough to know. That life's too short to waste it. Or my minute of fame    </segment3>
