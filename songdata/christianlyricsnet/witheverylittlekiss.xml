		<segment1>Well I still remember the first time I felt the power of your kiss. It his my like a bolt of lightning. I said, I never will recover from this. And like the words from the mouth of a prophet. I have lived to see those words come true. Just look at me now, Im still reeling</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: With every little kiss Im reminded. How wonderful it is to be in love with you. With every little look. With every little touch. With every little kiss</segment2>
		<segment3>Like a moth being drawn to a candle. This is something that I cant resist. I guess you could say Im addicted. Cause I keep coming back again and again. And after all of the storms that weve weathered. All the seasons of change weve been through. Somehow the flame keeps getting brighter</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Bridge: You still amaze me. With each little kiss. You still amaze me. With each little kiss. You still amaze me. With each little kiss</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus.     </segment6>
