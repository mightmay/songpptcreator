		<segment1>There's nothing like being torn apart. By what holds you together. Should have built my house in something solid. Standing in the center of a glass table. But can't see through until it breaks. I lose my breath, and now I ask, now I ask</segment1>
		<segment2>Have you ever breathed for me?. Filled my lungs when I could not. Captured breath and rescued me. Did I call it normalcy, normalcy. Breathe for me</segment2>
		<segment3>Follow me in lost despair. Strings of song in minor key. Our philosophical truth in which we trust. Failed behind the wheel of your automobile. Knocked me in the chest voided of my breath. Can I breathe, can I breathe?.     </segment3>
