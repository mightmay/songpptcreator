		<segment1>Sitting in a traffic jam 11:52 p.m. Just a few miles south of Cincinnati, Ohio. I take my pen and start to write. The thoughts that fill my head tonight. Nothing terribly profound. Just these simple words. That keep my heart anchored down. That keep my restless heart anchored down </segment1>
		<segment2>I do, I do, I do, I do believe. I know, I know, I know, I know it's true, yeah. I do, I do, I do, I do believe. Lord, I believe in You. I believe in You </segment2>
		<segment3>Now these can be confusing times. The skeptics posing as the wise. It's hard to see the light. Through all the shadows of the doubt. But You keep saying all the while. It takes the vision of a child. Looking through the eyes of faith to see reality. So once again I will say. I believe You're the life. You're the truth, You're the way </segment3>
		<segment4>I do, I do, I do, I do believe. I know, I know, I know, I know it's true, yeah. I do, I do, I do, I do believe. Lord, I believe in You. I believe in You </segment4>
		<segment5>If this faith in You is blind. It's not to anything that's true. 'Cause Your love opens up my eyes. To see that everything I need. Is found when I believe in You, yeah</segment5>
		<segment6>I do, I do, I do, I do believe. I know, I know, I know, I know it's true, yeah. I do, I do, I do, I do believe. Lord, I believe in You. I believe in You </segment6>
