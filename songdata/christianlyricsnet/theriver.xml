		<segment1>These dry lips, they search for comfort. Will I settle for a quick rain or search for the source?. In the rain, life is beautiful.. I guess. I know there's more, I long for something deeper. </segment1>
		<segment2>Take me to.. </segment2>
		<segment3>How deep and broad is this communion. Channel of amazing depth. </segment3>
		<segment4>Water pulling under me. IÂ’m not moving, You move me. I'm ready for this current now. Take me to the river    </segment4>
