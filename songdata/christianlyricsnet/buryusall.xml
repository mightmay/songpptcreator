		<segment1>I see them coming. With shrouds to bury us all. Before we were born they shaped our lives. Leading us into an unmarked grave. In moments life could end. So I will speak while I can</segment1>
		<segment2>This is my chance. My time to stand</segment2>
		<segment3>We may fail alone but that is better. Than dying with them only to be forgotten. I for one would rather suffer now. Than leave this life without passion</segment3>
		<segment4>This is our chance. Our time to stand    </segment4>
