		<segment1>The air is so clear, the sky is so blue, I know what you mean, I feel lucky too. I found a dollar, it's like a dream. I love this place, my Slurpee is so Green.</segment1>
		<segment2>So much easier to think that we did this all ourselves, so much easier to let our hearts do what they've felt. To throw our chips up in the air, and let the praise fall where it may. I feel, I feel lucky. </segment2>
		<segment3>It's a well know fact, our hearts are black. A maze full of mice, a game of cosmic, dice, a neverending quiz, is all you think this is. A gaping black hole, all the glory that you stole. (There's no such thing as luck.)    </segment3>
