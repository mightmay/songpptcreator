		<segment1>It seems like everytime we're here. I look right back at you. As your eyes perk up and you say. Boy, don't you come unglued. I'll be so kind to bust it up. On the floor. I'll make a change. So that you want me more. So that you want me more</segment1>
		<segment2>Is this really my idea?. I had no clue. That all of this was relly happening. My thoughts remain. Lying on the floor. It's not my fault. I'm such and awful mess and more</segment2>
		<segment3>Now we're here at breakneck speeds</segment3>
		<segment4>Oh just to make me feel. Less aware of all the times. The times I made you. It's stronger than. You really want it to. And make a face that said. You know just what to do. You know just what to do</segment4>
		<segment5>Is this really my idea?. I had no clue. That all of this was really happening. My thoughts remain. Lying on the floor. It's not my fault. I'm such an awful mess and more. More..</segment5>
		<segment6>It's true I failed. But your love covers me. It's true I failed</segment6>
		<segment7>Is this really my idea?. I had no clue. That all of this was really happening. My thoughts remain. Lying on the floor. It's not my fault. I'm such an awful mess and more..    </segment7>
