		<segment1>before i plead my case. before we start again. do you know your place?. do you understand who started this?. have you thought this through?. are you prepared and sure of you?. did you think that i care too?. from your gentle heart so pure and true </segment1>
		<segment2>my sympathies. for you mean nothing. your words mean nothing. cause it means nothing </segment2>
		<segment3>it's got nothing to do with me. it's got nothing to do with me. i feel it so violently. it's got nothing to do with me </segment3>
		<segment4>so before i plead my case. before we start again. do you know your place?. do you understand who started this?. have you thought this through?. and who is it you answer to. do you think i still care too?. i'm afraid this one's on you.     </segment4>
