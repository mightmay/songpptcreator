		<segment1>Enthroned and exalted. I rejoice that you've befriende me. To the ends of the earth you've bestowed your blessings. I bow my head to you in reverence. Forever I will delight in your protection. You surround me in your favor with a shield. How majestic is your name. Merciful and righteous oh Most High. Lift me from the gates of hell. I'm undeserving yet you still bless me. To inherit eternity with you. Ensured salvation, I praise you in your greatness     </segment1>
