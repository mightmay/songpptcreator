		<segment1>What have you been doing lately?. Your life could use improving greatly. I just wanted to know what's going on, but everything that goes is going wrong. What have you been doing lately?. Your life could use improving greatly. I just wanted to know what's going on, but everything that goes is going wrong. When I saw Justin he said he was just in visiting on spring break. I said &quot;What a surprise. You're one of those guys I haven't seen since 1998.&quot;. We talked for a while, and I tried to smile as he told me about his college life. He parties Fridays through Thursdays (but not for birthdays). He's acquired a taste for Miller Lite. Pardon me while I throw up. I guess some people never grow up. What happened to the salvation you claimed?. It breaks my heart to see how much you've changed. It breaks my heart to see how much you've changed. Adn then there's Vanessa. Her life got so messed up. She just can't get along. Her emotions they can't cope, 'cause she's lost all hope. She can't see right from wrong. Rationality left her (or shrunk with her sweater). She's a fanatic. She's over the edge. She needs Lemon Pledge to clear those cobwebs from her attic.    </segment1>
