		<segment1>death and life are in the power of. the tongue, it's little and boasts great things, it's a fire, a word of evil. you can bless or curse men. destroy or rebuild, words shot like arrows to kill, tongues taught to sepak lies, critic, deceit. abundance of the heart, speaks the mouth. there is a time to speak or keep silent. speak as a child or a grown up. every man be ready to hear. and slow to speak, I say you. that every word that men shall speak. will give account in the day of judgement. for your words you will be condemned.    </segment1>
