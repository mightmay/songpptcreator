		<segment1>You got me feeling like I do. You know you're not me. But you're feeling like me too. And I know you were going to be mine. But I took a little too much time</segment1>
		<segment2>Do do do do do do</segment2>
		<segment3>I watch you giving life to someone new. But you see me holding out for something too. And I keep selling wishes to the sky. But they never seem to get that high</segment3>
		<segment4>Do do do do do do</segment4>
		<segment5>When i'm seeing black sheep. In wolves clothing. I see it's a lie. I know it's a lie</segment5>
		<segment6>Help me 'cause i'm tired of living numb. But you leave me keeping face with everyone. And I could let you know that I was wrong. I'm still waiting for the perfect time</segment6>
