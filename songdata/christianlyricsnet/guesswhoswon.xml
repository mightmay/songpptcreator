		<segment1>That's it that's the last straw. You've tried so many times that I have to declare war. I'm sick of your foolish attack, devil. So step back I'm on a one way track, devil. To take back all the things that you've stolen. No withholdin I'm rollin and with the scriptures unfolding. That your time is near. and wit the power of God I'm gonna persevere. So go ahead and try to turn up the heat. 'Cause with my sword drawn you're gonna feel defeat. The seat occupied to the right of my God. Is the reason why I've got my feet shod. The Word of life in the form of three. Is given to me as artillery to sue. To abuse and bruise you. leave you standing in a daze wondering who's who. You chose to be defeated or to be disarmed. Anyway you want it we're gonna bring you harm. In this battle only strong survive I now who's with me. And who's by my side. He's the tower of strength and the pillar. To a hardened heart He's the tiller. No scrilla can entice me to stay off your tail. I'm gonna keep fighting til God prevails. Cause the alarm has been rung. Praise to God has been sung. The victory dance has been done. The battle's over and GUESS WHO'S WON    </segment1>
