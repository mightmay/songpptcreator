		<segment1>From Underneath I wanted you. To see the first thing I ever poured my heart into. You'll never know the pain that I've been through. I'm not so sure you'll ever know. And so I'll make you understand the words that built my life. Were not from you, but from my father's hand</segment1>
		<segment2>Do you remember that cold day in December. Leaving everything you knew behind. I may never know how it feels to stand beside you. Or take your hand when I need some direction. And I may never know what it's like to see you smile back at me. Or know you'd be proud of me</segment2>
		<segment3>From underneath I promise to erase the past. And let my heart forgive the former you. Replace the dark of old and start brand new. I never thought I'd see the day. I walk toward the end of life and turn the other way. I'm reaching out o take my Father's hand    </segment3>
