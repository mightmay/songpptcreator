		<segment1>You're running faster than before, but you're not trying. High school drama doesn't leave it just changes faces. I couldn't ask for anything more even though I'm asking you. I couldn't ask for anything more even though I'm asking you. What do you think?. I thing you should say something. Silence will never tell. Tell me when I've said too much. Don't be afraid. I think you are strong enough to make it. Don't let what others say make you question your beliefs. You couldn't ask for anything more. You've got all that you need. You couldn't ask for anything more. You've got all that you need. Listen to what you say. Don't try to say you're sorry. Sorry won't change a thing. Stick to your convictions. What do you thing?. I think you should say something. Silence will never tell. Tell me when I've said too much. Don't be afraid. I think you are strong enough to make it. Don't let what others say make you question your beliefs.</segment1>
