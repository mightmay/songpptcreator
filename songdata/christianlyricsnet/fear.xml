		<segment1>The cradle of civilisation sparks my fascination. Truth ignites our generation to change what's been programmed. Inside the mind. Don't you turn a blind a. Change what's been programmed inside. Don't you turn a blind eye. Listen to me when i tell you. Feel the passion in my breath. Stay on top if they let you. Cause the change is permanent. Change is permanent. Rudiments ofinterpersonal communication. Truth will uproot and bring war's devastation to light. Don't you turn a blind eye. Change whats been programmed inside. Staying silent is a crime. [CHORUS]. Change starts in your mind. Leave the past behind. Forget everything you know. Make a change..let go. Change starts in your mind. Leafe the past behind. Forget everything you know. Make a change..let go. Let go..let go.. let go. [CHORUS]    </segment1>
