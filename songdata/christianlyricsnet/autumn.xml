		<segment1>red leaves blow in the wind. leaving home and everything it's known behind. barren branches wave goodbye. as the red leaves slowly die. every flower stares and watches. as the wind takes me away. before the sun shone upon me. now the wind takes me away. red leaves falling. through the branches. making their way to the ground. blowing by the flowers sleeping. no one knows the leaves are leaving    </segment1>
