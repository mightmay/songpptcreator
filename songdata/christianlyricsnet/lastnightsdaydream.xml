		<segment1>From my sleep tonight. I woke to a frightening sight. All the best of me. Held up to Your perfect light. I reached for Your hand by moonlight. Could anyone ever match Your love. Of Your mercy's touch, Your kindness</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. While the world is asleep now. I'm wrapped up in wonder. Of all I could never dream. That night is a treasure. I want to remember. I want to forever be. In last night's daydream</segment2>
		<segment3>So steeped in Your presence. Like pinches, it woke me from a dream. Now I see the paint run. On the water-color kingdom. And I want to believe again. Just like the first time. When from my eyes. You took the scales that blinded. Here am I for Your sending. Could anyone ever match Your love. Of Your mercy's touch, Your kindness</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>When I come to the end of me. I'm relying on someone other. Come to the end of me. I'll be living for someone stronger</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus</segment6>
		<segment7>The world is still sleeping. I want to remember    </segment7>
