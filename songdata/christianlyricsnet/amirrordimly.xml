		<segment1>to be out from under. to be yours again. tearing this asunder. talking now and then. to understand just what they see. this seeming meaningless story</segment1>
		<segment2>remember me. through a mirror dimly. distance slowly deadens. only pieces of a looking glass remain</segment2>
		<segment3>ashes are left, no more than dust. where they see beauty I see rust</segment3>
		<segment4>say I will see you again    </segment4>
