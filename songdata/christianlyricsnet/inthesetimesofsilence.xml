		<segment1>What else is there. After the slipping away. When everything is silent. And nothing is around, alone. Looking deep inside. Hearing the echo of my soul. No one can know. In there times of silence. These times of separation. I find there is a void that rises up. A peace that brings my tears. A comfort that no one else can offer. So why do people turn away. Why they look elsewhere. And base there self on opinions. When the truth is so evident. That this God of Love is so constant. When every thing is gone. Destruction and storms. My Jesus stands to help.     </segment1>
