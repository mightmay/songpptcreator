		<segment1>Okay, so Im gonna say it. Im not afraid to say it. The clocks on my wall keep ticking, the moments that I keep missing. Okay, so I must confess that. Ive settled for so much less than. What You designed, Im not taking my life one day at a time</segment1>
		<segment2>Cause life is short and quickly passing by. Father, will You help me make the most of what is mine. With eyes open wide. Im taking You in. Making the time mean all that it can. I dont need a sign. I just need to begin, need to begin like this. With every second of every minute. Im livin in it and thats how I. Say it. Oh yeah, Im gonna say it, oh yeah, yeah. Thats how I say it. Oh yeah Im gonna say it, oh, oh </segment2>
		<segment3>I got so much to discover. A hand I could lend another. A word that could bring some healing. Is there any better feeling?. Hold up, gotta see the beauty. Hold up, gotta let it move me. I wanna be, with You here in the now. Im done missing out </segment3>
		<segment4>Let me fall in Your arms. Resting here in Your arms, I found. A peace like I have never known, like I have never known. Counting every star. Nothings ever too far. With You here. I see it all so clear.     </segment4>
