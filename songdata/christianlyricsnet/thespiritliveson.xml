		<segment1>Oh I watched it all fall down. I saw your face in the crowd. I saw the tears flowing from your eyes. I saw the fire in the sky. And we had no reason why. I asked will we ever be the same. You said to me</segment1>
		<segment2>The spirit lives on, Long after life, long after death. Has crumbled to the ground. The spirit lives on, Long after life, long after death. They will always be around. Because the spirit lives on</segment2>
		<segment3>I heard about the cross. How they thought all was lost. And how your friends trembled in their fear. And I heard about the nails. And the crown upon your head. And I know they thought you'd never rise again. But I can hear you say</segment3>
		<segment4>I will live on. Long after life, long after death. Has crumbled to the ground. I will live on. Long after life, long after death. I will always be around. Oh I will live on    </segment4>
