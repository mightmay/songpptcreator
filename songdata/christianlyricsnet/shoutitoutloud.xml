Do you need to be reminded (need to be reminded). It doesn't matter what you do or say. Just forget the things that you've been told. We can't do it any other way. Everybody's got to rock and roll, whoo, oh, oh</segment1>
		<segment2>Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud. Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud</segment2>

		<segment4>Don't let 'em tell you that there's too much noise. They're too old to really understand. You'll still get rowdy with the girls and boys. 'Cause it's time for you to take a stand, yeah, yeah</segment4>
		<segment5>Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud. Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud</segment5>

Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud. Oh yeah. Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud. Hear it gettin' louder. Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud. And everybody shout it now. Shout it, shout it, shout it out loud    </segment6>
