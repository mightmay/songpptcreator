		<segment1>[Chorus- X2]. Dawg the truth a travel. When we spit get a grip like boots and gravel. We bout to take it to the streets and scream from the roof tops. From the hood, to the burbs, to the booth, to the boondocks</segment1>
		<segment2>[Verse One - Flame and Thi'sl]. Flame: A yo. The I, I see our generation is fallen. Sick like Mardi Gras and we don't live in New Orleans. Real like '95 when bloods and crips was bangin'. When my homie said &quot;Flame forget school I'm slangin'&quot;</segment2>
		<segment3>Thi'sl: They skip school they bangin. Roc choppin' and slangin', posted up they hangin'. Till he hit wit a banga</segment3>
		<segment4>Flame: Now he's covered in blood but not the blood of Christ. His ice is bloody and not even his diamonds shine</segment4>
		<segment5>Thi'sl: His soul is lifted, the sad part he wasn't gifted. With the gift of life through Christ we're given</segment5>
		<segment6>Flame: STOP! Better yet go straight to the cross. The cross of Christ who came just to quicken the lost listen</segment6>
		<segment7>Thi'sl: The word says He's the judge of the quick and the dead. The healing hands that restores us we sick in the head</segment7>
		<segment8>Flame: Bless the one that bled, when our hearts were hard. He called us forth, and visit our spiritual grave yard Father</segment8>
		<segment9>[Chorus- X2]. Dawg the truth a travel. When we spit get a grip like boots and gravel. We bout to take it to the streets and scream from the roof tops. From the hood, to the burbs, to the booth, to the boondocks</segment9>
		<segment10>[Verse Two - Flame]. We're the Christians that witness out on the front line. And if we losin' our breath its not from runnin' from one time. It's from grindin' shinin' and spitin' bars of truth. Exhaustin' our whole heart to school yards of youth. Feel like I'm fastin' cuz dirty I ain't ate in a while. We been preachin' while heathens are fakin' a smile. They not happy knowin' your daddy is locked up. He snorted so much coke his nose is stopped up. Ya mommy got knocked up, ya homie got chopped up. Yet he still poppin' them rocs and you throwin' ya block up. We spit Jesus dirty for more reasons than one. Cuz time is leakin' even more of a reason to run. Call me Flame cuz my temperature's 209. I feel the fire preachin' Jesus before we run outta time. It's one Christ one hope one life for real. And since we all gotta die hope I die in the field</segment10>
		<segment11>[Chorus- X2]. Dawg the truth a travel. When we spit get a grip like boots and gravel. We bout to take it to the streets and scream from the roof tops. From the hood, to the burbs, to the booth, to the boondocks</segment11>
		<segment12>[Verse Three - Thi'sl]. No doubt fam where I stand with the team. I'm a runnin' back the head coach Christ the King. John 1 shows us how Christ esteems. We champions now through Him despite the ring. Like Aragon He comin' back like &quot;Return of the King&quot;. Like Sam I'm walkin' with Flame to carry the ring. Opposin' squad hate to come through and bury your dreams. But like John man my eyes have seen some scarier things. But we take it to the streets because they need the truth. Break bread and fellowship and go and feed the truth. Drop seeds and intercede that they heed the truth. Edify and strengthen them so they don't leave the truth. Flame fam I'd bleed for you- but that goes without sayin'. Cause I know Christ He breathes through you. No doubt what we came to do, what we about to do. Hit the roof tops and shout the truth</segment12>
		<segment13>[Chorus- X2]. Dawg the truth a travel. When we spit get a grip like boots and gravel. We bout to take it to the streets and scream from the roof tops. From the hood, to the burbs, to the booth, to the boondocks.     </segment13>
