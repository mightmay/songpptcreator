		<segment1>Verse 1:Well we're Finally Over the Mountain, Now were walking in the valley belowIts been a long road we've been going, and it seems we've got a long way to goYou know I tried but I can't make it on my ownAnd in this life a friend can help it feel like homeChorus:Sometimes love doesn't say the words that make you feel goodSometimes love takes you to the end of all you thought you couldAnd this love is the catalyst that causes the changeSometimes love loves you too much to leave you the sameVerse 2: Well we've gotten over the questions,  that had seemed to stand in our wayStill we don't know all of the answers, but somehow it's okYou know I tried when times are tough to turn around,But in this life a friend knows when to stand their ground    </segment1>
