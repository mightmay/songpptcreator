		<segment1>I can see a change in me. Since you came into my heart. I can find a peace inside. Since you came into my heart</segment1>
		<segment2>I can feel this heart of mine. Falling for my King. I can feel this love of Yours. All around</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. Falling down like rain. Your love is falling on my face. Falling down like rain. Your love is here. Your love is near</segment3>
		<segment4>Love is here in place of fear. Since You came into my heart. Gone is doubt, now faith abounds. Since You came into my heart.     </segment4>
