		<segment1>Something's very wrong here. Your heart has frozen over. And something's very strange here. You've lost all desire</segment1>
		<segment2>The comfort we create to prove we're something. But we're starving. Screaming in the night cause you want answers. From the one. And there is hope again</segment2>
		<segment3>Don't give up you're not thinking. Don't give up just keep seeking (Oh yeah). And I, I am for you. And I, I will love you. And I, I am for you. And I, I will save you</segment3>
		<segment4>Come and take my face or forever I will walk alone. And all the same mistakes. Cause I know you, I deny you. Days go by and choices still remain forever. Right and wrong is black and white. The illusions of this world. And there is hope again</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't give up, you're not thinking. Don't give up, just keep seeking (Oh yeah). And I, I am for you. And I, I will love you. And I, I am for you. And I, I will save you</segment5>
		<segment6>I send my self to you. Yes always and always. I send my love to you[x2]</segment6>
		<segment7>. And I, I am for you. And I, I will love you. And I, I am for you. And I, I will save you</segment7>
		<segment8>You found today, found today, you found today, with your life today</segment8>
		<segment9>    </segment9>
