		<segment1>Dripping wet with practiced sincerity, Cute slogans for tangible mysteries. You reduce your god (pruned to profit your ego). to a tv commercial, &quot;Buy what I sell! (advertise, advertise!)&quot; you scream, &quot;Purchase my lifestyle!&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>I once held the key, but now I have nothing. You are so naive. I'm sorry for leading you along. I'm just a man, I'm just a man. I'm just a man!</segment2>
		<segment3>Wake me up and wipe the cliche from my eyes. It's killing me when all I see is hypocrisy and lies. I know that my faults bring me down, it's a constant battle. That's why I have to be honest with you now.. I'm not your saint, I'm not your savior</segment3>
		<segment4>I once held the key, but now I have nothing. You are so naive. I'm sorry for leading you along. I'm just a man, I'm just a man. I'm just a man!</segment4>
		<segment5>I once held the key to everything you ever dreamed of. Now I have nothing. I'm sorry for leading you along. I'm just a man, I'm just a man. I'm just a man!</segment5>
		<segment6>Just a man, Just a man!    </segment6>
