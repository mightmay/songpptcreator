		<segment1>Take 5 minutes and think about what you just said, write it down, read through it, play it over in your head. Did you even bother to think before you spoke. ignorant words from uneducated minds &quot; you fools. We will not be stopped!</segment1>
		<segment2>Your second face will never hide the true way that you feel. don't tell me where I belong and don't talk to me about what. I believe.</segment2>
		<segment3>I was here long before you were and I'll be here when you leave. Do what you will, say what you want, but we are never going anywhere.</segment3>
		<segment4>Since when did you become the authority on who has a place in hardcore. You draw the line where you see fit, only accepting what you believe. The mouths of a hypocrite have. received their reward in full. I'll stay true to what I believe and in the end we'll see that you were wrong. we will not be stopped!    </segment4>
