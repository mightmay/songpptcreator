		<segment1>Perched upon the lap of hope and northern slopes. Nestled in the wooded oak, a dream unfolds</segment1>
		<segment2>Come and see. The confectionary. Very merry. The confectionary</segment2>
		<segment3>The continued hum of notes and needle pokes. Garland with a hint of snow 'round the windows</segment3>
		<segment4>Come and see. The confectionary. Very merry. The confectionary</segment4>
		<segment5>You stir all the sweetened pots and watch the clocks. The time has come to close the shop that time forgot..     </segment5>
