		<segment1>We've waited so long. I never was that strong. Keep looking back on. Reading it right or wrong. Welcome me back home. I never walked alone. Help me to move on. We've come too far to turn back now</segment1>
		<segment2>I know. We've come to far to turn back now. I know</segment2>
		<segment3>All rise, all rise. All rise, all rise. All rise, all rise. All rise, all rise. All rise, all rise. All rise, all rise</segment3>
		<segment4>Make it a part of who we are. So much left worth living for (love is coming). Make it a part of you and me. So much left for us to see (love is coming). Make it a part of every turn. So much left for us to learn (love is coming). Make it a part until the end. So much left to learn again (love is coming)    </segment4>
