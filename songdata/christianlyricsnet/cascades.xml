		<segment1>The flashlights came out. The sound of the move. The wet of the ground. You're starting to lose. You took every breath. You've traced all my steps. Just start in the streets. And end what is left</segment1>
		<segment2>I know that this is gonna leave you now. I know that this is gonna take you down. I know that this is gonna take you out</segment2>
		<segment3>And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know. And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know</segment3>
		<segment4>The house that I know. The flags they will blow. The races are where. The current will go. The threats I obey. The summer that fades. It starts in the streets. And ends in my veins</segment4>
		<segment5>I know that this is gonna leave you now. I know that this is gonna take you down. I know that this is gonna take you out</segment5>
		<segment6>And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know. And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know</segment6>
		<segment7>Losing all control. Losing all control. This time you'll find. Losing all control. Losing all control. You fall behind</segment7>
		<segment8>I know that this is gonna leave you now. I know that this is gonna take you down. I know that this is gonna take you out. And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know. And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know. And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know. And I am everywhere. Everywhere. I am all you need to know    </segment8>
