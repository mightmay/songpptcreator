		<segment1>Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be</segment1>
		<segment2>Waging the battle for the appreciation you'll never win. Behold the army that will harken with open souls. A tiny voice of pester softer than a drop of a pin. And so naive thinking you were. The source you told. I was composing the beginning before you had begun. Where did you sharpen such a tongue. For the sound you spill. I want the honor for the favor that I've already won. Without the ignorant deduction. That you reveal</segment2>
		<segment3>Give me the pain of something real. No empty notion, I want to see the pressure rising. Give in a way that I can feel. When you disagree with me I want to see your eyes burn</segment3>
		<segment4>Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be</segment4>
		<segment5>You wrote the words you couldn't. Stomach manifesting with breath. I read the thoughts you never. Questions would show me your face. If confrontation were to wake and. Rear it's ugly head. I get the feeling you'd be wanting it all erased. This simple gossip is your only definition of life. And what a vacant purpose taking it to your grave. There is no threat of loss in. Hearing the slant you cry. Oh what a fool to think you fell. On the mass you crave</segment5>
		<segment6>Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be</segment6>
		<segment7>Awaken from the delusion of validity. Awaken into the truth of how it used to be. Wake up</segment7>
		<segment8>Fall into the flood of your awakening. Drown. You're a trace of what I used to be</segment8>
		<segment9>Awaken    </segment9>
