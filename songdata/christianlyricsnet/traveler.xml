		<segment1>Neon lights flickering. Outside the cafe. Ice on the windshield. Stars in a black sea. On a winter road. Flurries of snow. I'm ready to go </segment1>
		<segment2>Past farmhouse and pasture. Our voices together. Rise to the drumming. Of big-rigs and trailers. Long hours to daylight. A rumbling bus. Our bed and our board </segment2>
		<segment3>Heavenly Father. Remember the traveler. Bring us safely home. Heavenly Father. Remember the traveler. Bring us safely home. Safely home </segment3>
		<segment4>In the towns off this highway. The people are kind. They welcome us in. I sing in their church halls. Old hymns and prayer songs. With lifted hearts. We rejoice in the Lord </segment4>
		<segment5>Heavenly Father. Remember the traveler. Bring us safely home. Heavenly Father. Remember the traveler. Bring us safely home. Safely home </segment5>
		<segment6>I long for my family. And friends to remind me. Of where I have been. And where I am going. And where I come from </segment6>
		<segment7>Heavenly Father. Remember the traveler. Bring us safely home. Heavenly Father. Remember the traveler. Bring us safely home. Safely home    </segment7>
