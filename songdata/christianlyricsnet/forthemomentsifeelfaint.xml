		<segment1>Am I at the point of no improvement?. What of the death I still dwell in?. I try to excel, but I feel no movement. Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. Never underestimate my Jesus. You're telling me that there's no hope. I'm telling you your wrong.</segment2>
		<segment3>Never underestimate my Jesus. When the world around you crumbles. He will be strong, He will be strong</segment3>
		<segment4>I throw up my hands. &quot;Oh, the impossibilities&quot;. Frustrated and tired. Where do I go from here?. Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly. Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear</segment4>
		<segment5>[Chorus]</segment5>
		<segment6>I think I can't, I think I can't. But I think you can, I think you can. I think I can't, I think I can't. But I think you can, I think you can. Gather my insufficiencies and. place them in your hands, place them in your hands, place them in your hands    </segment6>
