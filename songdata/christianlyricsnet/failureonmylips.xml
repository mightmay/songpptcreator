		<segment1>Under an eclipse of ever-rising feeling. Moving faster through my veins. And bleeding out the sun. That's bleeding down our necks. And burning my eyes. If this is a crutch for the weak. Then I am the least of these. So cut off my arms and break my legs. So I don't feel this anymore. Choking on all of the feeling. That I'm swallowing in. Tasting the failure on my lips. That I've lead in. And this is my last chance for survival. A last ditch effort to cure my ache. We're so vain aren't we?. We're so proud and empty. We're left leaning on our only intrigue. The lies that I've told won't bury us whole. They won't find us time. This is the end of the story that I can forget. This goes far beyond our loyalties. And we feign as a shield. That's teeming with guilt and resonance. But we held our heads so high. We have not yet defeated failure    </segment1>
