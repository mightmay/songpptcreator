		<segment1>I'm the man with all I've ever wanted. all the toys and playing games. I am the one who pours your coffee, corner booth each Saturday. I am your daughter's favorite teacher. I am the leader of the band. I sit behind you in the bleachers. I am every man</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm the coach of every winning team and still a loser in my mind. I am the soldier in the airport facing giants one more time. I am the woman shamed and haunted by the cry of unborn life. I'm every broken man, nervous child, lonely wife</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: Is there hope for every man. A solid place where we can stand. In this dry and weary land. Is there hope for every man. Is there love that never dies. Is there peace in troubled times. Someone help me understand. Is there hope for every man</segment3>
		<segment4>Seems there's just so many roads to travel, It's hard to tell where they will lead. My life is scarred and my dreams unraveled. Now I'm scared to take the leap. If I could find someone to follow. Who know my pain and feels the weight. The uncertainty of my tomorrow, The guilt and pain of yesterday</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS: (reprise). There is hope for every man. A solid place where we can stand. In this dry and weary land. There is hope for every man. There is Love that never dies. There is peace in troubled times. Will we help them understand?. Jesus is hope for every man    </segment5>
