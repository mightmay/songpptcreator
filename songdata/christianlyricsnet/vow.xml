		<segment1>Another year has come and gone. Nothing's changed. I wasted another year. Doing the same old things. I want to break out of this. Turn my life around. I'm going to make a vow. To repent and turn to You </segment1>
		<segment2>I'm crying out to You now. As I make my New Year's vow. I'll tell You I love You. And I'll honor You somehow. Hear my promise to You in this New Year's vow. I give You all of me. You'll be all of my life. And I'll never think twice. To do all that You have for me. In my New Year's vow </segment2>
		<segment3>Lord I'll do my best to do all that I say. I'm not perfect but I know it's okay. If I stumble You won't condemn my shame. I'm going to make a vow to repent and turn to You </segment3>
		<segment4>I'm crying out to You now. As I make my New Year's vow. I'll tell You I love You. And I'll honor You somehow. Hear my promise to You in this New Year's vow. I give You all of me. You'll be all of my life. And I'll never think twice. To do all that You have for me. In my New Year's vow </segment4>
		<segment5>It's a new year this year is different. From the other ones </segment5>
		<segment6>I'm crying out to you now. As I make my New Year's vow. I'll tell You I love You. And I'll honor You somehow. Hear my promise to You in this New Year's vow. I give you all of me. You'll be all of my life. And I'll never think twice. To do all that You have for me. In my New Year's vow    </segment6>
