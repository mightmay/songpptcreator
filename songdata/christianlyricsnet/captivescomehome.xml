		<segment1>Now your lost but found. This sinking sand has closed you in. And brought you down. A struggle that's beyond yourself. Don't you know you gotta. Get up get up and find a way back home. So hold on tight let's go. And leave behind false sense of hope. Where creeping shadows call your name. As I'm waiting for the world to end. I'm clinging on to oxygen. Pulling captives by the hand. Come home. Come home. Come home</segment1>
		<segment2>Words come and go..but how will your actions unfold. Your character will be shown when lights go down. Now creeping shadows call your name. Possession is their claim now. Turn it around turn it around. As I'm waiting for the world to end. I'm clinging onto oxygen. Pulling captives by the hand. Come home. Come home. The world is falling faster falling. So take this step and leave to bring you home from the other side </segment2>
		<segment3>There's hope inside the box you close. That only opens when your life explodes. On the other side. Come home. Explodes on the other side. Come home     </segment3>
