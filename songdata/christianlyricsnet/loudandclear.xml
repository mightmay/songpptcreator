		<segment1>I have seen you in this place ever since I was a little boy. Reaching out from every corner of this room. It's so good to see your face, once again from a child's eyes. I can see You Father Your coming over me</segment1>
		<segment2>Like the nature of a child. Lord you let me walk in to the wild. But I can hear you call me back to you. Your coming in loud and clear</segment2>
		<segment3>As I turn my face to you I can see that everything is true. When I come back home I know I'll find you here. Too many years I've done without till I found someone to. sing about. Makes me wonder what I've been doing all this time</segment3>
		<segment4>Like the nature of a child. Lord you let me walk in to the wild. But I can hear you call me back to you. Your coming in loud and clear</segment4>
		<segment5>Lord You bring me to my knees. Just when I thought that I already knew you. I couldn't hold you to anyone. I take the hand that made my hand. You opened up my eyes. I didn't know you till I knew your son</segment5>
		<segment6>Like the nature of a child. Lord you let me walk in to the wild. But I can hear you call me back to you. Your coming in loud and clear    </segment6>
