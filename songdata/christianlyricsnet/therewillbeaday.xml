		<segment1>I try to hold on to this world with everything I have . But I feel the weight of what it brings, and the hurt that tries to grab . The many trials that seem to never end, His word declares this truth, . that we will enter in this rest with wonders anew . . But I hold on to this hope and the promise that He brings . That there will be a place with no more suffering . . [Chorus] . There Will Be A Day with no more tears, no more pain, and no more fears . There will be a day when the burdens of this place, will be no more, we'll see Jesus face to face . But until that day, we'll hold on to you always . . I know the journey seems so long . You feel you're walking on your own . But there has never been a step . Where you've walked out all alone . . [Chorus] . . Troubled soul don't lose your heart . Cause joy and peace he brings . And the beauty that's in store . Outweighs the hurt of life's sting . . I can't wait until that day where the very one I've lived for always will wipe away the sorrow that I've faced . To touch the scars that rescued me from a life of shame and misery this is why this is why I sing      </segment1>
