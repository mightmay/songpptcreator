		<segment1>We all separate ourselves. We all turn off. Not in this world, Because today we are a disaster. So we meditate. Through our prayers.</segment1>
		<segment2>Some days we fight ourselves, Some days we love our minds.</segment2>
		<segment3>But there is grace. There to have us. So I'm gone away. I'm with my father</segment3>
		<segment4>Some days we fight ourselves, Some days we turn off. Not in this world, Cause today we are a disaster.    </segment4>
