		<segment1>There's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said. I'm just repeating myself repeating someone else. Equally incapable of uttering a single new thought. Yet you are ever worthy of adoration. So how can I for a moment cease to lift my heart in praise?. Your name is glory. My song is victory. And I will keep on singing. There is no oppostion. No thing can stand in your way. Make my life your own    </segment1>
