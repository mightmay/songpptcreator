		<segment1>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul. And forget not all his benefits. Praise the Lord, oh, my soul. Forget not who forgives your sings. Praise the Lord, oh, my soul.</segment1>
		<segment2>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul. Who heals all your diseases. Praise the Lord, oh, my soul. Who redeems your life from the pit, and crowns you with love and compassion; who satisfies with good things, so your youth is renewed like the eagle's. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul. Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord, oh, my soul. (repeat)    </segment2>
