		<segment1>Dawn my skin. Thinking of memories. In my yesterdays dream</segment1>
		<segment2>And the truth was in. Watching as children pass. Over birds of the sin</segment2>
		<segment3>And the Son will rise. Like a morning star overhead. Bring on the days. In the year of the Dead</segment3>
		<segment4>Judge me true. Thinking of all these white. And the kings of youth</segment4>
		<segment5>With their nights so bright. Cutting through darkest of hour. And the main glass filled</segment5>
		<segment6>And the Son will rise. Like a morning star overhead. Bring on the days. In the year of the dead</segment6>
		<segment7>And the Son will rise. Shining just and still overhead. Washing away. In the year of the dead</segment7>
		<segment8>Open and remember me. You want to open to be free. You want to open remember. You want to open to be free. You've got to get up, get up, go remember me. You've got to get up, get up, go to be free. You've got to get up, get up, go remember me. You've got to get up, get up, go to be free.     </segment8>
