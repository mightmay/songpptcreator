		<segment1>Tell yourself its over now. Try to kill a broken vow. If only you could find the strength to kill the memories. These empty pages never turn. You lit the flame and let them burn. You tried to bury me so deep but what lies beneath. Will your hope die alone. Will you fade on your own. Can you just turn away and let me go</segment1>
		<segment2>Lie to me if you can feel. That this love was never real. Walk away if you can learn to love again. Lie to me, if you can leave. Ill still be here when you see. Youre not alone, you dont have to run again. And leave me in denial</segment2>
		<segment3>All your secrets crawl inside. You keep them safe, you let them hide. You feel them drinking in your pain. To kill the memories. So close your eyes and let it hurt. The voice inside begins to stir. Are you reminded of all you used to be. Can you just turn away and let me go</segment3>
		<segment4>Lie to me if you can feel. That this love was never real. Walk away if you can learn to love again. Lie to me, if you can leave. Ill still be here when you see. Youre not alone, you dont have to run again. And leave me in denial</segment4>
		<segment5>All the pain you fed. It starts to grow inside. It lives again and you cant let it die. so you believe youll never find. A reason to love again</segment5>
		<segment6>Lie to me if you can feel. That this love was never real. Walk away if you can learn to love again. Lie to me, if you can leave. Ill still be here when you see. Youre not alone, you dont have to run again. And leave me in denial    </segment6>
