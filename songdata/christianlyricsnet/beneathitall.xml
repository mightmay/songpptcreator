		<segment1>Beneath it all, this world bridges a hate. It will take us all down, down to ruin. I am being pushed all this way. A welcomed self-seeking livelihood, is a doom for all. Everything must recede, everything. We rip our hands through anything. And then we make it please ourselves. It these ways I can't change. Not even one step on my own, on my own.. Break the chains that hold. I've been kept so long. Break the chains, keep so long. Can someone help me through this mess, The lies and the ties that bind. Do not be deceived. This will fade away. Can someone bring me to, bring me to the feet?. The feet of Jesus    </segment1>
