		<segment1>Lift up your face! Lift up your face!. Salvation is calling, salvation is calling. Lift up your face! Lift up your face!. Salvation is calling, salvation is calling (your name)</segment1>
		<segment2>You have fallen so far now, you dont even know how, you are going to survive. But just over the horizon, a new light is shining, breaking through the darkest night. LOVE IS COMING AND ITS CALLING OUT YOUR NAME. You feel like your life is fading - youre tired of waiting - for your moment to arrive. But tomorrow will bring - a song that you can sing  and your hope is gonna rise. LOVE IS COMING AND ITS CALLING OUT YOUR NAME. Do you hear Him calling - can you hear Him calling - Hes calling out your name. Hes calling out your name  just over the horizon  a new light is shining. SALVATION IS ON ITS WAY    </segment2>
