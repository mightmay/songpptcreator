		<segment1>Im at the end of my rope and. and I cant take it no more. I think Im losing control. I am about to let go </segment1>
		<segment2>. Im lost at the end of my rope. and Im burning Im yearning Im hurting for hope. Im needing this burden to go. but Im searching for purpose Im searching to know. its knocks me down to the floor. till Im pounding the ground and Im down in my hole. its got me down till I go. till I cry out to you I cant take it no more. you are the one that I hold. you are the one in my soul. you are the one that I know. that will come when I call and I fall and I fold lets go cmon! </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus </segment3>
		<segment4>so you said to let go. let go of everything I had hold. let go till its all in control. let go till its gone up in smoke. crush me mold me make me. stretch me fold me change me. until I aint just the same me. you the only one my safety. your are the one gonna saved me. and I dont wanna ever live safely. destroy my world and take me. past the end of my rope break me </segment4>
		<segment5>. Bridge: crush me mold me make me. stretch me fold me change me. (the end the end of my rope). crush me mold me make me. stretch me fold me change me. (the end the end of my rope)    </segment5>
