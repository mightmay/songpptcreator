		<segment1>Give me a couple minutes maybe one or two. to tell you about the time I'm spendin' with my crew. Travelin' down the road on the way to the show. Fraff backseat scribin' writing words that'll flow. Bradley bringing beats, Kalel boomin' the bass. I'm a vessel of the spirit singin' in this place. We're battle soldiers caught in spritual warfare. fightin' for the souls of the lost in this dark nightmare. Eternal flames and the gnashing of teeth, man. the thought of anyone living there we just can't stand </segment1>
		<segment2>Are you believing, loving, living. receiving his love, his giving </segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>We got this question for you to ask yourself over again. Are you gonna live in sin or are you gonna live for him?. We're gonna let you know, we're gonna show you how. If you want to live for him you have to do it right now </segment4>
		<segment5>You see it's written in stone that thou shalt not steal. That's why we're coming out of our speakers. givin' you somethin' real, I feel good. and at the same time when we praise God. we make the crowd jump up, we make your head bob </segment5>
		<segment6>I know you think you're ok. but you've never ever felt this way. I know you think you're alright. but you take him inside in spite. I know you think you're alone. but you're not, so here we go    </segment6>
