		<segment1>Chorus. He's calling you, He's calling you. Tell me what are you going to do. Your time has come for a life brand new. He is call.ing you, He is calling.. you</segment1>
		<segment2>There's a voice deep inside. You hear it and you cannot hide. Seems like after all you've tried. You never satisfied</segment2>
		<segment3>You softly heard Him call and say. Promised that you'd change someday. Even if you run away, you still can't deny. Something's going on and its real. Somehow deep inside you can feel</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>Remember when you said before. That you needed something more. Now it's time to realize, He's knocking at your door. Things that you used to do. Somehow don't appeal to you. Why would you deny that you. Don't want them anymore. Listen to your heart and to your soul. And don't be afraid anymore     </segment5>
