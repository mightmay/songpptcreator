		<segment1>Its the song of the redeemed. Rising from the African plain. Its the song of the forgiven. Drowning out the Amazon rain. The song of Asian believers. Filled with Gods holy fire. Its every tribe, every tongue, every nation. A love song born of a grateful choir</segment1>
		<segment2>Its all Gods children singing. Glory, glory, hallelujah. He reigns, He reigns. Its all Gods children singing. Glory, glory, hallelujah. He reigns, He reigns</segment2>
		<segment3>Let it rise about the four winds. Caught up in the heavenly sound. Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals. To the faithful gathered underground. Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation. Some were meant to persist. Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples. None rings truer than this</segment3>
		<segment4>And all the powers of darkness. Tremble at what theyve just heard. Cause all the powers of darkness. Cant drown out a single word</segment4>
		<segment5>When all Gods children sing out. Glory, glory, hallelujah. He reigns, He reigns. All Gods people singing. Glory, glory, hallelujah. He reigns, He reigns    </segment5>
