		<segment1>Three months hope. Hospital bed. Fighting hard. For every breath. The doctor says. There's not much chance. Mom breaks down once again</segment1>
		<segment2>And I don't know how I'm supposed. To see you standing here. Somewhere in this mother's tears. She cries because her nightmare's coming true. Maybe my faith's not that strong. Jesus tell me that I'm wrong. But there's so much pain in this room. And I don't see you</segment2>
		<segment3>Fifteen years. Man and wife. All it took. was just one night. To break those vows. And change their lives. Now they're wondering if this is goodbye</segment3>
		<segment4>And I don't know how I'm supposed. To see you standing here. Somewhere in these lovers' tears. Two broken hearts that don't know what to do. Maybe my faith's not that strong. Jesus tell me that I'm wrong. But there's so much pain in this room. And I don't see You</segment4>
		<segment5>Sometimes I wanna turn my back. And shake my fist and run so fast. From everything I ever have believed. But on the darkest days I won't let go. It will still be well within my soul. Even when the answers don't come easily</segment5>
		<segment6>'Cause You said You'd never leave</segment6>
		<segment7>So I know You're standing here. You've been crying these same tears. You've been here all along. So give me strength to just hold on. Until I see you</segment7>
		<segment8>Until I see you. Until I see you. Until I see you    </segment8>
