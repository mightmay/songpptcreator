		<segment1>Tears wash the blood off of my face. Why did it have to be this way. I've taken the last beating from you. This I promise you</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm waiting for the sun to rise. And make the darkness go away. The time has come to say goodbye. And God will help me find a way. Just to let go of the fear</segment2>
		<segment3>I can't deny these thoughts of hate. The poison adding to my shame. Forgiveness can't take scars away. But I forgive you anyway</segment3>
		<segment4>I'm waiting for the sun to rise. And make the darkness go away. The time has come to say goodbye. And God will help me find a way. Just to let go of the fear</segment4>
		<segment5>I had enough. I took too much. But this I swear I will pray for you. I had enough. I took too much. But this I swear I will pray for you</segment5>
		<segment6>. I'm waiting for the sun to rise. And make the darkness go away. The time has come to say goodbye. And God will help me find a way</segment6>
		<segment7>I'm waiting for the sun to rise. And make the darkness go away. The time has come to say goodbye. And God will help me find my way. As I let go of the fear</segment7>
