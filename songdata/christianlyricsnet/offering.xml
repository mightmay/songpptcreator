		<segment1>Magnificent Holy Father. I stand in awe of all I see. Of all the things You have created. But still You choose to think of me</segment1>
		<segment2>Who am I that You should suffer. Your very life to set me free. The only thing that I can give You. Is the life You gave to me</segment2>
		<segment3>This is my offering, dear Lord. This is my offering to You, God. And I will give You my life. For it's all I have to give. Because You gave Your life for me</segment3>
		<segment4>I stand before You at this altar. So many have given You more. I may not have much I can offer. Yet what I have is truly Yours</segment4>
		<segment5>This is my offering    </segment5>
