		<segment1>I am yours; you are mine. Believe in you, friend of mine. You're not fading in my eyes. Could you stay? Could you stay? </segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus:]. We must hold onto our faith in each other. We must let go of our pain, yeah I say. We must hold onto our faith in each other. Gotta still believe in each other. </segment2>
		<segment3>Time is short to live the life. Don't give up, friend of mine. Strength to rise one more time. Could you stand? Could you stand? </segment3>
		<segment4>[CHORUS] </segment4>
		<segment5>It's okay to feel weak. It's okay to fall down. It's okay to lose sight. But we gotta believe and stand together. </segment5>
		<segment6>[CHORUS (repeat)] </segment6>
		<segment7>    </segment7>
