		<segment1>You used to talk about how you wanted to believe. Sometimes you let it out, sometimes you kept it all from me. I never meant to get in the way</segment1>
		<segment2>Every time I breathe I tow a fine line. What's become of me? A sorry forced rhyme. I always wanted to show you how. I only troubled you with my doubt</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't stand to face the sun. The leaves are in the gutter and the clouds are rolling in. I won't lean on anyone. I never learned to fake it so I never could fool you with the honest truth</segment3>
		<segment4>Every time I breathe I tow a fine line. What's become of me? A sorry forced rhyme. I always wanted to show you how. I only troubled you with my doubt. All The tragedy that could have been worse. walking in my sleep until my feet hurt. I always wanted to show you how. I only troubled you with my doubt</segment4>
		<segment5>I guess the means is always hard when. the end is something that you'll never get. this book could end a little different but it'll end with me    </segment5>
