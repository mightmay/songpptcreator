		<segment1>He is fierce and He is tender. He's our judge and our defender. And He calls us to surrender. For He loves us to the core. He is frightening and resplendent. He is present and transcendent. He's enmeshed and independent. And He cannot love us more</segment1>
		<segment2>So He calls our names. And we fear Him for His goodness. For we know He won't be tamed. So He calls our names. And we wonder if we answer. Will we ever be the same</segment2>
		<segment3>He's a comfort and a terror. A destroyer and repairer. He's more terrible and fairer. Than our mortal tongues can say. He is hidden and revealing. He's appalling and appealing. He's our wounding and our healing. And He will not turn away</segment3>
		<segment4>Holy Lamb of God. And He cannot love us more. Holy Lamb of God</segment4>
		<segment5>He is wild, He is wonder. He is whispering and He is thunder. He is over, He is under. And He suffered for our gain. He's a comfort and a danger. He's a father and a stranger. He's enthroned and in a manger. And He says we're worth His pain    </segment5>
