		<segment1>The pathway is broken. And The signs are unclear. And I don't know the reason why You brought me here. But just because You love me the way that You do. I'm gonna walk through the valley. If You want me to</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: CauseI'm not who I was. When I took my first step. And I'm clinging to the promise You're not through with me yet. so if all of these trials bring me closer to you. Then I will go through the fire. If You want me to</segment2>
		<segment3>It may not be the way I would have chosen. When you lead me through a world that's not my home. But You never said it would be easy. You only said I'd never go alone</segment3>
