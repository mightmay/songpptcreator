		<segment1>Through this mirrored image feeling. Was my head so oddly reeling. Not aware of floor or ceiling. Kneeling and crying out. All the past I'd spent denying. Watching others lose in trying. The time I wasted spent in crying. Where could truth be found?. Joy could not be found in money. Don't put your faith in somebody. Not in attempts to be funny. Life seems incomplete. Why doubt the life He offers. When all the world is not enough?. Who knows if we've got time. We cannot wait 'till it's too late. Searching for someone else to blame. Hoping I won't go insane. Selfish pride my only gain. Faking sanity. The charade said I was fine. Knowing riches would be mine. I chose to face the cross the sign. I gave my future up. Joy could not be found in money. Don't put your faith in somebody. Not in attempts to be funny. Life seems incomplete. Why doubt the life He offers. When all the world is not enough?. Who knows if we've got time. We cannot wait 'till it's too late    </segment1>
