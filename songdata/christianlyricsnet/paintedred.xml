		<segment1>If I could not hold a pen. I would write of you on my heart instead. You have bought me with your blood. And I am painted red by your love</segment1>
		<segment2>Ooh </segment2>
		<segment3>If I could not say a word. My life would speak of love I dont deserve. Hope means holding on to you. Grace means youre holding me too</segment3>
		<segment4>Ooh .     </segment4>
