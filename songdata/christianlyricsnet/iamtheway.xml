		<segment1>You've got a secret no one knows. Locked away where no one goes. Deep inside your heart. It's tearing you apart</segment1>
		<segment2>You hide the pain in all you do. But still the shackles binding you. Are heavier than stone. But you are not alone</segment2>
		<segment3>PRE-CHORUS: When you're down. Look around. And you'll see.. I am with you</segment3>
		<segment4>Look to me. And you'll see. I will be.. there to guide you</segment4>
		<segment5>Take my hand. And I can. Lead you on.. for you know that</segment5>
		<segment6>CHORUS: I am the answer. I am the way. I am the promise. I have called your name</segment6>
		<segment7>So you want a brand new start. Asking Me into your heart. Down on bended knee. For the world to see</segment7>
		<segment8>And the chains around your heart. Fall away and break apart. Suddenly you see. The truth has set you free</segment8>
		<segment9>PRE-CHORUS</segment9>
		<segment10>CHORUS</segment10>
		<segment11>Surrounded by darkness you stumbled along. Knowing the road that you traveled was long. But I'm here beside you..yes, here all along. The one that will carry you on..</segment11>
		<segment12>PRE-CHORUS</segment12>
		<segment13>CHORUS</segment13>
		<segment14>Oh when you are down. You think no ones around. But I'll be with you both night and day</segment14>
		<segment15>I know the good times. I'll see you through bad times. Oh you know that I'm here to stay</segment15>
		<segment16>CHORUS</segment16>
		<segment17>When you're down. Look around. And you'll see I am with you    </segment17>
