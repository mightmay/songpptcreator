		<segment1>How could it be that I've fallen this far?. Asleep to the truth, yet awake in the dark. I fell for the trick, how ungrateful. I've become in Your eyes. Am I so foolish to chase and demand, things of this earth that were made by Your hand. Drawn in deceit by exchanging. Your truth for a lie.</segment1>
		<segment2>Satisfy my soul. And drown my heart in Yours. 'Til I find that all of me desires You.</segment2>
		<segment3>When I consider the moon and the stars. Excuse have I none, to describe who You are. And still I exalt the created. Oh Lover of mine, bring sight to my eyes.</segment3>
		<segment4>Satisfy my soul. And drown my heart in Yours. 'Til I find that all of me desires You.</segment4>
		<segment5>Beautiful, Wonderful, Colorful, Maker. What if we could only see You, the Creator. (repeat)</segment5>
		<segment6>Satisfy my soul. And drown my heart in Yours. 'Til I find that all of me desires You.     </segment6>
