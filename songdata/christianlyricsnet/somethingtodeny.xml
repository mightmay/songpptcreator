		<segment1>If I'm here and You're here. Would You tell me something, would You tell me something?. If they all can blame You. Does it mean that You are really there?. Do You make mistakes and never care?</segment1>
		<segment2>They want something to deny. They want something to deny. If You're not here. What's the light inside of me?. If You're not here. How can they deny You?</segment2>
		<segment3>They're racing to the bottom. When they look at You through human eyes. They trade Your wisdom for their lies. We all need forgiveness. Will they put away the argument how is it they can't commit?</segment3>
		<segment4>They want something to deny. They want something to deny. If You're not here. What's the light inside of me?. If You're not here. How can they deny You?</segment4>
		<segment5>If You're not here. What's the light inside of me?. If You're not here. How can they deny You?</segment5>
		<segment6>And I guess I speak for myself when I bow down to You. And for everything the world trades its' soul. I've hated from the start. And it won't be long until You come and show them who You are. And there will be no more time, time for something to deny. Yeah, I just want to know</segment6>
		<segment7>If You're not here. What's the light inside of me?. If You're not here. How can they deny You?</segment7>
		<segment8>If You're not here.. If You're not here.. If You're not here..    </segment8>
