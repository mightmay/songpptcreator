		<segment1>when its over we all wanna be. among the victims an refugees. we make a case for sympathy. when mercy is what we need</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus. I will not forget what youve done. Took the blame when i was the guilty one. Covered me</segment2>
		<segment3>Now the sun has come and the weight is gone away. if the mountains fall into the sea. be my savior rescue me. when justice becomes my enemy. Its hard to swallow how much we need</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>bridge: let me hide inside your skin. where Ill never be condemned</segment5>
		<segment6>Chorus    </segment6>
