		<segment1>Why am I in love with a girl who treats me oh so badly?. Why am I in love with a girl who made me feel so sadly?. I can't get over you. Don't know what I should do. You leave me feelin' down, then you come back around. Why am I in love with a girl who treats me oh so badly?. Why am I in love with a girl who made me feel so sadly?. I thought I was over you I still don't have a clue. Why you came back this way and you got me up today. Why am I in love with a girl who treats me oh so badly?. Why am I in love with a girl who made me feel so sadly?. I guess I never learn I don't wanna learn. Guess I never learn I don't wanna learn. Why am I in love with a girl who treats me oh so badly?. Why am I in love with a girl who made me feel so sadly?. I don't know why. Don't know why. Why?</segment1>
