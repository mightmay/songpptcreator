		<segment1>My outstretched arms for you. My outstretched heart bleeds for you. A cry rang out, &quot;Crucify the Lord&quot;. and a cry saved my life, &quot;It is finished&quot;. This is Jesus Christ who came to die for you. now sins ripped apart He died for you. I'm free and I love it, I'll fight for this. I thank you God. You're so great. (He was so torn for you. He died though He did not have to and this pain was for you). He was ripped and torn, spit on. and mocked because you were you. Then He died and rose again just for you to. All the pain within is because you sin for yourself. And Christ is the only one that will bring you through. He died for you. Thank you    </segment1>
