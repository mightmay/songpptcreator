		<segment4>The months went by it was their wedding day. A church on a hill wedding bells rang away. She looked like a princess. All dressed up in pearls. It was her proudest day</segment4>

		<segment9>'Cause you're the only girl I'll ever love. And I'd do anything not to give you up. If I could only stop the world. When you're standing by my side. See I'm having the time of my life. Yes, I'm having the time of my life    </segment9>
