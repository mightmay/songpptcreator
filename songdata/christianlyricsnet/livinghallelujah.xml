		<segment1>Who am I?. That You came to earth for me. To die on a tree?. Who are you?. Son of man, Son of God. Yes, I believe it's true. More than words I bring to You. May all I say and may all I do be</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS. Hallelujah, hallelujah. May everything about me be. Hallelujah to my King. Hallelujah, hallelujah. May everything about me be hallelujah</segment2>
		<segment3>All of me. I surrender completely. Take control. I want all of You. So I'm letting go</segment3>
		<segment4>I am healed and I'm forgiven. I am free because I'm living</segment4>
		<segment5>CHORUS</segment5>
		<segment6>It's all so clear, it's all so clear. I was born to worship</segment6>
		<segment7>Hallelujah, hallelujah. May everything about me be hallelujah.     </segment7>
