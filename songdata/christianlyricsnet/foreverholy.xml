		<segment3>God, You hold when all is breaking. You restore the tired and aching. I guess it's just hard to believe. The Love You've poured out on me. I guess I'm just starting to see. How You're working in me, whoa Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>This is what makes my head spin. You're forever Holy. God of all creation. Pour Your life into me. This is so overwhelming. You're forever Holy. God of my Salvation. Clothe me in Your Glory</segment4>
