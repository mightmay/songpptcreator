		<segment1>Daisy, give yourself away. Lookup at the rain. The beautiful display. Of power and surrender. Giving us today. And she gives herself away</segment1>
		<segment2>Rain, another rainy day. Comes up from the ocean. Give herself away. She comes down easy. On rich and dead the same. And she gives herself away</segment2>
		<segment3>Let it go. Daisy, Let it go. Open up your fist. This fallen world. Doesn't hold your interest. It doesn't hold your soul. Daisy, let it go</segment3>
		<segment4>Pain, give yourself a name. Call yourself contrition. Avarice of blame. Giving isn't easy. Neither is the rain. When she gives herself away</segment4>
		<segment5>Daisy, why another day?. Why another sunrise. Who will take the blame. For all redemptive motion. And every rainy day. When he gives himself away</segment5>
		<segment6>Let it go. Daisy, let it go. Open up your fist. This fallen world. It doesn't hold your interest. It doesn't hold your soul. Daisy, let it go</segment6>
		<segment7>Let it go. Let it go. Let it go. And you let it go, go. Let it go. Let it go. Let it go, go. Let it go. Let it go    </segment7>
