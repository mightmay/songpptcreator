		<segment1>A heavy heart I bring. For I am tired Lord. Awaken my lost love for You. Take this heart of stone. And warm this bitter cold. Awaken my lost love for You</segment1>
		<segment2>Let your children fall down and worship. Fall down and know You. For You are holy. Let Your children rise up before You. Rise and adore You. For You are holy. You are holy</segment2>
		<segment3>Remind us who we are. When we have wandered far. Awaken our lost love You. And like the morning star. You chase away the dark. There is no shadow here with You. With You, Lord</segment3>
		<segment4>Let Your children fall down and worship. Fall down and know You. For You are holy. Let Your children rise up before You. Rise and adore You. For You are holy</segment4>
		<segment5>Just a glimpse of You is all we ever needed. Just a touch from You is all we ever needed. Just a glimpse of You is all we ever needed. ItÂ’s all that we are needing now</segment5>
		<segment6>Let Your children fall down and worship. Fall down and know You. For You are holy. Let Your children rise up before You. Rise and adore You. For You are holy</segment6>
