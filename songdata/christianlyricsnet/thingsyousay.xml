		<segment1>It's so hard, believe in things, that you can't see yourself, see yourself. Behind the seen, lies more then you can understand yourself, stand yourself. They tell you what you want to hear, but when they're done, will you still live in fear?. Everything you said to me put me on my knees. I can't believe a thing you say, I can't believe a thing you say. You're told that selfishness will guide your path. What will you do when that dosen't last?. Now I know that you're the only one, but do they know that you're the only one. It's so hard to, believe in things that you can't see.    </segment1>
