		<segment1>I've met a lotta friends, Been a lotta places, Hung out in Hollywood, With all the perfect faces, Girls with dark tans, Surfboards, the right bands, Sometimes I felt like I could, Hold the whole world in my hands.. </segment1>
		<segment2>Till I met You, There were these things that made my day, But You changed my views, And I realized that there is more to life, Than a Chevrolet. </segment2>
		<segment3>And You say there's something different now, About the way I hold my head, and I am, Ready for it now, To line 'em up and knock them down. </segment3>
		<segment4>(chorus). Come along now. Grab a hand I'll show you how. We can all get out of here. Well soon it'll all be gettin' clear. Take me, break me, you never gonna shake me, There's a lot about me you don't know so don't doubt me.. I was sent to let the world know, Wind me up and let me go, Told ya I would never be truly artificial, Won't just back down sittin' in the background. Never play your enemy you'll never see the end of me </segment4>
		<segment5>It's ok, if you need some time, need some time to think, and it's alright, I won't walk the line, until I see you blink (x2) </segment5>
		<segment6>(chorus)    </segment6>
