		<segment1>If I go to the dark, You illuminate. all the shadows that aren't there. Running away is just a poor metaphor. because I'm never quite as far as I think </segment1>
		<segment2>Danger, the way that she moves in your brain. without a face. Patient You wait, even though I was wrong. it's not the same </segment2>
		<segment3>Looking weak never had more appeal. Bend the knee, stop this heart for a while. Counting on the grace You give </segment3>
		<segment4>Just when I think that I'm alone I think about You more. And the words You said are always ringing in my ears.     </segment4>
