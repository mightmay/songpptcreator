		<segment1>erse 1. There is a time to live, There is a time to die. There is a time to laugh, There is a time to cry.</segment1>
		<segment2>Verse 2. There is a time to dance, A time for joy's embrace, And in all seasons, God. we humbly seek Your face.</segment2>
		<segment3>Pre-Chorus. This is our offering to You, This is our offering.</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus. Everything I am is for Your glory, Everything, I am for You, Lord. Everything I am is for Your glory, Everything, I am for You, Lord.</segment4>
		<segment5>Verse 2. There is a time to sow, There is a time to reap. A time for victory, A time to claim defeat. A time to be renewed, A time to be reborn. In all seasons, God. we bow before Your throne.</segment5>
		<segment6>Bridge. The earth stands still without You. We could only move because You made us to. The world is nothing without You. We could only love you because You made us to.    </segment6>
