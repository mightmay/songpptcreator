		<segment1>In the morning deep calls to deep. In the morning, you quietly speak. In the morning, you find those who seek, In the morning.</segment1>
		<segment2>In the morning, I bring my request. In the morning, each care is confessed. In the morning, you quiet unrest. In the morning.</segment2>
		<segment3>In the morning, I listen and wait. In the morning, faith anticipates. In the morning, you make my way straight, In the morning.</segment3>
		<segment4>Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In the morning, deep calls to deep. In the morning you quietly speak. In the morning you find those who seek, in the morning, in the morning.    </segment4>
