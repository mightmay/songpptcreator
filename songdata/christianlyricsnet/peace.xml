		<segment1>Peace like a river flows within me. Love like a waterfall pours on me. I'll never be alone, can't you see. Peace like a river flows on.. Hope is a fire burning in my soul. Life is eternal with you Lord. Who could ever ask for more. Peace Like a river flows on..</segment1>
		<segment2>..on, think of all I could have missed. ..oh, I just can't get over this</segment2>
		<segment3>Faith is a light shining down on me. Mercy is a wind blowing over me. The grace of God has set me free. Peace like a river flows on..    </segment3>
