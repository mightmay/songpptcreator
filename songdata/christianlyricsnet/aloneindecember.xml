		<segment1>you always amazed me. but thats the past. i kept silent and it rained for days. my inside were drenched. but i guess that's the part of growing up. i never wanted to learn. and i grew into the man. that you never knew. but i wouldn't be this way. if it wasn't for you. 100 thank you's. it this is love. fairy tales never came true. judies are black in full bloom. and i died in the womb. take it back, all that's gone. it's all still there like you left it. december stayed the same. nothing ever changed but you. every dream civered in dents. love can't fly tonight. couples will rest, i'll be sleepless. so cry yourself to sleep. this is about broken hearts. this is about me. bending again for nothing. i'd run to you but pain awaits. i'm coming home. but i'll be late. no deeper than imagination can be. sight with nothing to see. what's faith if i can't believe. it's everything. a cure, but i make it a disease. God take me because i hate me    </segment1>
