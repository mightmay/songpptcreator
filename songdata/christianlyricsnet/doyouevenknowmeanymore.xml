		<segment1>It's cold tonight, I heard her say. She was staring out the window as I came home late. She tried to smile, But looked away. Oh but I could see the tears were running down her face. She said You go to work, You pay the bills, I stay at home, And I make the meals.</segment1>
		<segment2>But you don't even know who I am anymore, You're a million miles away, Though I see you every day. And I've been waiting right here, Over all these years. And sometimes I get so lonely, I need to know you love me, But do you even know me anymore?</segment2>
		<segment3>I turned around, To see my son. Well I remember his first birthday. Now he's 21. I missed his life, I missed it all, Oh to him I was a man just living down the hall. He said I learned to live, Without you Dad, But I'd give it all. Just to have you back.</segment3>
		<segment4>But you don't even know who I am anymore. I used to wait at all my games, But still you never came, And I've been waiting right here, Over all these years. For the time you said you'd owe me, I wanted you to show me, But do you even know me anymore?</segment4>
		<segment5>I've watched my days, Turn into years, And now I'm wondering how I wound up here. I dreamed my dreams, I made my plans, But all I've built here is an empty man.</segment5>
		<segment6>And I don't even know who I am anymore. God I'm praying through the tears, Let me make up all these years. Oh have I waited too long?. Can I start again?. To be the man You've wanted of me. I'm begging You to show me, But do You even know me anymore?    </segment6>
