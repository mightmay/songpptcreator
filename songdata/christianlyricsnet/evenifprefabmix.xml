		<segment1>Stranded in the middle of a hurricane. I've got an umbrella but nowhere to stay. Do I give up now or do I face the cold. I better get some boldness. Looking to the left I see it coming. I'm alone and I'm scared and it's heading my way. Do I run. Do I hide. Do I dare close my eyes. Do I face the fear inside </segment1>
		<segment2>Time after time. Lord I'll keep running back to You. Keep running back to You. I, I realize this time that I'll be fine </segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus]. Even if the stars fell like rain. Even if tomorrow never came. Even if the world I know should crumble. Nothing's gonna stand in my way. Even if the sun left the sky. And even if these tears never dry. Even if the mountains fall and tumble. If what's left of me is taken I will not be shaken </segment3>
		<segment4>Landed in the middle of the desert. And I'm wondering why what keeps me alive. When the water I drink and the air that I breathe is dry </segment4>
		<segment5>Time after time. Lord I'll keep running back to You. Keep running back to You. I, I realize this time that I'll be fine </segment5>
		<segment6>[Chorus] </segment6>
		<segment7>Even in the darkest night. I know I'll be alright. The world is bound to change. But You always stay the same </segment7>
		<segment8>You give me joy. You give me hope. You give me love that doesn't change </segment8>
		<segment9>[Chorus x2]    </segment9>
