		<segment1>Get up, get off the floor. I wish that I could show you the hope that overwhelms me. That left me so in love with a hope that is broke. If youd just take my hand, I swear I know the truth about The Absolute.</segment1>
		<segment2>I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying: &quot;Rejoice, the ones who trust in You.&quot;. The skies open up, prepare yourself. Scream it to the masses, our hope is here, our hope has come, tell everyone. Lead me to a life of positivity. Bring my mind to where it longs to be. This place is not my home, this bodys not my own.. not my own.</segment2>
		<segment3>The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down. The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down. The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down. The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down. The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down. The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down. The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down. The Absolute is coming, The Absolute is coming down.    </segment3>
