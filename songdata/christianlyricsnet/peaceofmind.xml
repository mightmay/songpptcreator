		<segment1>I wake up. A new day has come. It seems so hard to get out of bed. Sometimes I question. 'What is it for' it gets hard to find meaning in the routine. I've tried so hard to do it on my own. Sometimes I feel like giving up. But I've got to try. Why don't I try?. Try to find the meaning of this life. I know that god has his reasons. Peace of mind it comes and goes all the time. When will I learn to trust?. Concentration has left me now. I can't see your face everyday. Abstruse thoughts they tear me apart. I must see your face everyday. All the time I look into your eyes and then turn away on my own. Will I find the plans you have for my life?. This life just seems too short. Concentration has left me now. I can't see your face everyday. Abstruse thoughts they tear me apart. I must see your face everyday. Make my life yours.     </segment1>
