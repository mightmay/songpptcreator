		<segment1>Who is this God of heaven. The wind and the waves obey him. Oceans of fear overtaken by Love. Who is this God eternal. Naming the stars in the Galaxy. Wide open skies overwhelm me with Love</segment1>
		<segment2>[Chorus]. You are a great God your love is so good. You send the broken heart rejoicing. You are a great God your love is so strong. You tore the vial conquered hell and you reign. You are the king of glory. With fire in your eyes your coming. Into the sky were ready for you</segment2>
		<segment3>[Repeat Chorus (2x)]</segment3>
		<segment4>I will give you glory I will bring you praise. I will shout your victory for all of my days. I will give you glory I will bring you praise</segment4>
		<segment5>I will Give you all I am for all of my days    </segment5>
