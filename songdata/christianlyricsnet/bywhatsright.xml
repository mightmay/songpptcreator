		<segment1>My country tis of thee, as a child I was proud. Now I am much older, my opinion's changed by leaps and bounds. Save the environment is what you say and lab animals die everyday. How about the unborn in the womb that's robbed of it's life before it's born?. So don't tell me this is the home of the brave. Tax dollars kill kids everyday. Immorality does have a price. The price is death to an unborn child. By what right, do you take the things you take?. By what right, do you do what you do?. By what right, do you kill and steal?. My country tis of thee, no longer will I bow. My faith lies in god above, not in your government. Stole my right to pray in school and gave the right to kill a child. Taught morality is unnecessary. What happened to, In god we trust?. this country is stolen property based on lies and waste. So send your soldiers off to die. What happened to, In god we trust?    </segment1>
