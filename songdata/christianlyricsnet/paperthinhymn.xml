		<segment1>When your only friends are hotel rooms. Hands are distant lullabies. If I could turn around I would tonight</segment1>
		<segment2>These roads never seemed so long. Since your paperheart start beating leaving me suddenly alone. Will daybreak ever come?</segment2>
		<segment3>Who's gonna call on sunday morning?. Who's gonna drive you home?. I just want one more chance. To put my arms in fragile hands</segment3>
		<segment4>I thought you said forever. Over and over. A sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion</segment4>
		<segment5>These thoughts run through my head. Over and over. Complaints of violins become my only friends</segment5>
		<segment6>August evenings. Bring solemn warnings. To remember to kiss the ones you love goodnight</segment6>
		<segment7>You never know what temporal days may bring. So laugh, love, live free and sing. When life is in dischord. Praise ye the lord</segment7>
		<segment8>Who's gonna call on sunday morning?. Who's gonna drive you home?. I just want one more chance. To put my arms in fragile hands</segment8>
		<segment9>I thought you said forever. Over and over. The sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion</segment9>
		<segment10>These thoughts run through my head. Over and over. Complaints of violins become my only friends</segment10>
		<segment11>I thought you said forever. over and over. The sleepless night becomes bitter oblivion</segment11>
		<segment12>These thoughts run through my head. over and over. Complaints of violins become my only friends</segment12>
		<segment13>I thought you said forever. over and over. These thoughts run through my head    </segment13>
