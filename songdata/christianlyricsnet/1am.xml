		<segment1>It's one in the morning but I can not sleep. I'm thinking about you. If you were here I know you'd make that face. The one that makes me laugh. Which one is that?. So I'll sing this little song for you. and hope that you know I'm thinking of you now. So I'll sing this little song for you alone. Alone in my room. It's one in the morning but I can not sleep. Lying here worried sick. God I hope she's alright now, I can't imagine what I'd do. So I'm gonna say this little prayer for you. and hope that you know I'm praying for you now. So I'll say this little prayer for you alone. Alone in my room.    </segment1>
