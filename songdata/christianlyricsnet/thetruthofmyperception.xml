		<segment1>While shutters enclose, The boundaries of my heart, I hold my breath, Till the steady beating is shut out.</segment1>
		<segment2>In silence I wait for what is real, For I know the truth of my perceptions, Nothing in life matters more, more than you, Matters more, more than you</segment2>
		<segment3>When first feelings fade, I will still be here.</segment3>
		<segment4>I hold my breath, Till the steady beating is shut out, beating is, For I know the truth of my perceptions, Nothing in life matters more, more than you, Matters more, more than you.</segment4>
		<segment5>When first feelings fade, I will still be here.    </segment5>
