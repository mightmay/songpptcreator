		<segment1>Here I am longing, I can't stop this longing. For more of You in me. Lost in this moment, This beautiful moment. This prayer I sing to You. I'm crying out to You. To change the way I think, To steal away my pride. And make me new.</segment1>
		<segment2>Saturate my life, Fill every part of me with You. Drown me in Your love, Let me lose myself in You.</segment2>
		<segment3>Here I am longing, I can't stop this longing. For more of You in me. Lost in this moment, This beautiful moment. This prayer I sing to You. I gladly come to You, I want no place to hide. I'm pouring out my heart. To give You room.</segment3>
		<segment4>Saturate my life, Fill every part of me with You. Drown me in Your love, Let me lose myself in You.</segment4>
		<segment5>Saturate my life, Fill every part of me with You. Drown me in Your love, Let me lose myself in You.     </segment5>
