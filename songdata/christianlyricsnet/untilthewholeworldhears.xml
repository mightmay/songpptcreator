		<segment1>Lord I want to feel your heart. and see the world through your eyes. I want to be your hands and feet. I want to live a life that leads</segment1>
		<segment2>chorus. ready yourselves. ready yourselves. Let us shine the light of Jesus in the darkest night. ready yourselves. ready yourselves. May the powers of darkness tremble as our praises rise. Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out. Lifting up Your name for all to hear the sound. Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out. as the day draws near. we'll sing until the whole world hears</segment2>
		<segment3>Lord let your sleeping giant arise. Catch the demons by surprise. Holy nation sanctified. Let this be our battle cry</segment3>
		<segment4>chorus</segment4>
		<segment5>we'll sing until the whole world hears. we'll sing until the whole world hears</segment5>
		<segment6>Want to be your hands and feet. Want to be a life that leads. To see you set the captive free. Until the whole world hears. and I pray that they will see more of you and less of me. Lord I want my life to be the song You sing. Until the whole world hears Lord we are calling out. Lifting your name up for all to hear the sound. Like voices in the wilderness we're crying out. as the day draws near. we'll sing until the whole world hears. we'll sing until the whole world hears. we'll sing until the whole world hears. we'll sing until the whole world hears. we'll sing until the whole world hears. we'll sing until the whole world hears</segment6>
