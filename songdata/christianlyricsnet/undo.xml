		<segment1>Ive been here before. Now, here I am again. Standing at the door. Praying Youll let me back in</segment1>
		<segment2>To label me. A prodigal would be. Only scratching the surface. Of who Ive been known to be</segment2>
		<segment3>Turn me around, pick me up. Undo what Ive become. Bring me back to the place. Of forgiveness and grace. I need You, I need Your help. I cant do this myself. Youre the only one. Who can undo what Ive become</segment3>

Youre the only one who can undo. You are the only one who can undo. Youre the only one who can undo. What Ive become    </segment8>
