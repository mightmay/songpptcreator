		<segment1>Smell the despair in the air tonight. Filling up your lungs as you cry for help!. It's like guns in the middle of streets. Pointing at your head, I don't care to speak. Won't you understand my apathy, my insanity!. . Watching you die! watching you die!. Your blood is on me! I'm. Watching you die! Watching you die. Your blood is on me! I'm watching you die!. . Watch as your life fades away.. Your pain is masked by your decay. It's like acid dripping in, I see it burn but don't wipe the skin. It's not my fault once again..but there's blood on my hands!</segment1>
		<segment2>Watching you die! watching you die!. Your blood is on me! I'm. Watching you die! watching you die. Your blood is on me! I'm watching you die!</segment2>
		<segment3>I see the faces in my head, I hear the screams from the walking dead. Do you know about true regret. To know you lived your life for self. To think of all the chances I let go. ..I let go.. ..I let go.</segment3>
		<segment4>Watching you die, watching you die.. I'm Watching you die, watching you die. Your blood is on me!. Watching you die, watching you die.. Your blood is on me!. I'm watching you die, watching you die!. Your blood is on me!. I'm watching you die, watching you die. Your blood is on me.. watching you die, watching you die. Your blood is on me.. I'm watching you die!</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm watching you die!!    </segment5>
