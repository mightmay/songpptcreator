		<segment1>Were leaving you a message on your telephone. Everybodys wondering what youre doing home. Yeah, were starting and youre missing the party. Can you hear it playing your favorite song. Everybodys singing but somethings wrong. Cause youre missing, cause youre missing. Hey, hey, are you listening, hey, hey, are you listening</segment1>
		<segment2>Its no good to be alone. Its no good to be out there on your own. Its no good for you anymore than it is for me. Its no good, no good for you to be alone. Alone, alone, alone, no good to be alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Its been a little while, youve been outta the scene. Spending all your time chasing down a dream. Takes a lifetime, takes a lifetime. Its a short life, its a short life. You know it doesnt matter how high you climb. If no ones there to share the ride when you get there. Whos gonna be there</segment3>
		<segment4>Nobodys suppose to be an island. Stuck out in the middle of the ocean on your own. Im not giving up until I find you. Give me an S.O.S., Ill bring you home. Its no good for you to be alone    </segment4>
