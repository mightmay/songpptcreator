		<segment1>Staring at this empty canvas, Waiting for the next stroke of my life. It seems to go by so fast. Another day I've wasted wondering, How it all ends up instead of resting, That it's all in Your hands. My only piece is waiting before You. My praise to You, Drowning noise around me.</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I wish I could slow down time, I wish I could wait here at your feet. 'Cause with you is the only place that I wanna be. I know I should take it all in stride. I know you are there with every reach. 'Cause with you is the only place that I wanna be.</segment2>
		<segment3>On my own I always fade out fast, On the run my every step will last. I'm resting in your words that never fail. Your searching every part of me. I need to stop so I could hear You speak. I long for you so here I am so thirsty. My only piece is waiting before You. My praise to You, Drowning the noise around me.</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>It's where I wanna be, The greatness of your presence always leaving me here speechless. I've given up on making this life my home. In the fullness of your glory is beyond my comprehension. There's no greater joy then being with you my King.    </segment5>
