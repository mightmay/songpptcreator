		<segment1>An image flashed across my TV screen. Another broken heart comes into view. I saw the pain, and I turned my back. Why can't I do the things I want to?. I am willing yet I'm so afraid. You give me strength. When I say</segment1>
		<segment2>{chorus}: I wanna be Your hands. I wanna be Your feet. I'll go where You send me. I'll go where You send me. I'll be Your hands. I'll be Your feet. I'll go where You send me. I'll go where You send me. And I try, yeah I try. To touch the world like You touched my life. An I'll find my way. To be Your hands</segment2>
		<segment3>I've abandoned every selfish thought. I've surrender everything I've got. You can have everything I am. And perfect everything I'm not. I am willing, I'm not afraid. You give me strength. When I say..</segment3>
		<segment4>This is the last time. I turn my back on You. From now on I'll go out. Send me where You want me to. I finally have a mission. I promise I'll complete. I don't need excuses. When I am Your hands and feet. I am Your hands and feet     </segment4>
