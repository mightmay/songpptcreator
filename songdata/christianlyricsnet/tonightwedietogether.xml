		<segment1>I see words in front of me, yet I can't understand. Why I keep coming back and losing my self respect. I wait to find myself in this. The hardest part of being here is wanting more and more of you and praying I could resit. </segment1>
		<segment2>Tears roll down an empty smile. Tonight we die together. A picture-perfect memory. For you to regret forever. </segment2>
		<segment3>We live for dreams that take forever, but I can say that. Never did we want it more. Take my actions not as habits. Those which are not justified. Lead me to the one who cares. Show me how to feel alive. </segment3>
		<segment4>Tears roll down an empty smile. Tonight we die together. A picture-perfect memory. For you to regret forever. </segment4>
		<segment5>This void won't break the spirits will. The death of this will be my victory, Oh God. </segment5>
		<segment6>Tears roll down an empty smile. Tonight we die together. A picture-perfect memory. For you to regret forever    </segment6>
