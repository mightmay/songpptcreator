		<segment1>Cant believe youre here now. Tiny dream come true. The answer to a prayer now. Im so in love with you. Couldnt wait to meet you. Hope you like your name. I get the funny feeling. Life will never be the same</segment1>
		<segment2>Safe and sound. Youre here with me now. Like I hoped youd be. Safe and sound. Youre here with me now. And thats all Ill ever need</segment2>
		<segment3>The worlds a scary place here. But baby its alright. Ill make sure the coast is clear. So you can just sleep tight. But if youre afraid of monsters. Like everybody is. Ill be right beside you. Closer than a kiss</segment3>
		<segment4>Safe and sound. Im here with you now. And you will always be. Safe and sound. Im here with you now. And thats all youll ever need</segment4>
		<segment5>Someday Im gonna teach you. The reason why we pray. So that heavens love may reach you. Every single day. So, baby close your eyes now. And say a prayer with me. Lord, I lay me down to sleep now. But I know I will be </segment5>
		<segment6>Safe and sound. Youre here with us now. And we will always be. Safe and sound Youre here with us now. And thats all well ever, all well ever need. Youre all well ever need    </segment6>
