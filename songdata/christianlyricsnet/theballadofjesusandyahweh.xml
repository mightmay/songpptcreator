		<segment1>Standin' there, they knock at your doorstep. Tryin' to make you part of their plan. They hand you a tract, say they wanna come back. You know, they said that Jesus just was a man. Christ is more than a teacher. I know He's God -- can't you see. The way that I know is: . Theres lots of proof when I read. Titus 2:13 says that Jesus. Is our God and savior so great. Peter and Paul say the same thing by the way. You can check Second Peter 1:1 today. CHORUS . From there it's to the letter to Hebrews. Talkin' how God's Son is unique. In Hebrews 1 verse 8 the Father truly does say. He says His only Son is God, yes indeed. CHORUS. Isaiah chapter 43, Jehovah says, There isnt a God or savior except for me. Thats why the Christ said, obey or you're dead. You must believe I am to save your souls .. Think!. Maybe I should check the beginning. Reading John 1:1 for a snag. &quot;And the Word was God.&quot; It's just as I thought. It's lookin' like it's truly a fact. CHORUS. Lots of other things you can show them. If they stage a counterattack. Remember to pray, then you really can say. &quot;I'd like to have the both of you back!&quot;. CHORUS    </segment1>
