		<segment1>Chorus: In the wilderness. In the wilderness. He calls his sons and daughters. To the wilderness. And he gives grace sufficient. to survive any test. And that's the painful purpose of the wilderness</segment1>
		<segment2>In the wilderness we wander. In the wilderness we weep. The wasteland of our wanting. Where the darkness seems so deep. We search for the beginning, for an exodus to hold. We find that those who follow him, must often walk alone</segment2>
		<segment3>Chorus</segment3>
		<segment4>In the wilderness we're wandering. for a way to understand. In the wilderness there's not a way. for the way to become a man. and become the exodus, the way to holy ground. But wandering in the wilderness is the best way to be found</segment4>
		<segment5>Chorus</segment5>
		<segment6>Groaning and growing amidst the desert days. the windy winter wilderness can blow the self away</segment6>
		<segment7>Chorus</segment7>
		<segment8>And that's the painful promise of the wilderness    </segment8>
