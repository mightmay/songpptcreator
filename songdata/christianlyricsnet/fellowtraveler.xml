		<segment1>You can't change who I am. Or the way that i think. I won't change how you live. Or the words that you speak. But neither of us is a stranger to joy or pain. No matter how we're different. We're very much the same</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: Fellow traveler let me take you to a place where Ive found rest. Fellow seeker let me show you where I've found true happiness. Fellow beggar I have good news, I know where there is bread. (I'll show you where there's bread)</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't know where you've come from. Or where you've been along your way. But I can tell you what I've lived through. And how I made it here today. Let me share with you the story of hope I've come to know. A love that's always for me. And a peace that frees my soul</segment3>
		<segment4>Chorus:</segment4>
		<segment5>So if you are hungry come to the table with me. And you won't go hungry ever again     </segment5>
