		<segment1>So many voices calling out to me. To sell me something, tell me what I need. But they don't know about the treasure. I've found. A gift from heaven I can't live without</segment1>
		<segment2>It's a kingdom and it's hidden deep inside. I will be living for much more than meets. The eye</segment2>
		<segment3>[Chorus:]. 'Cause I need the deeper life. Where the love of God runs far and wide. I need the deeper life. I will give him all my heart and mind. I won't be swept away by every changing tide. I believe in the deeper life</segment3>
		<segment4>I've got my telephone, got my radio. I got a lotta places I can go. But where I wanna be is off the deep end. My Jesus meets me when I dive right in</segment4>
		<segment5>Don't wanna slip slide on the surface of. This life. My soul will search until this thirst is satisfied</segment5>
		<segment6>[Repeat Chorus]    </segment6>
