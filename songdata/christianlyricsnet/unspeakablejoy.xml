		<segment1>When I wake up in the morning. Gets me out of bed. It keeps me running, skipping, jumping. Like a little kid</segment1>
		<segment2>You know sometimes I can hardly keep it inside. It overtakes me, overwhelms me. And I'm more alive</segment2>
		<segment3>I did not get it from any woman or man. And it's okay if they don't always understand. It's very easy to get caught in circumstance. It's even easier to break out in a dance</segment3>
		<segment4>Joy, unspeakable joy. 'Cause they did not give it. They can not take it away. Joy, unspeakable joy. In my heart and I can't let them steal my joy</segment4>
		<segment5>People ask me why this supernatural high. Seeing only sun when there's a cloudy sky. I know some trouble tries to surround me. But I've been given something greater deep inside of me</segment5>
		<segment6>I did not get it from any woman or man. And it's okay if they don't always understand. It's very easy to get caught in circumstance. I't even easier to break out in a dance</segment6>
		<segment7>Joy like peace passing all understanding. Been set free, chose freely the branding. Standing front and center with the mic in my grip. Staring at the world with a smile on my lips, flip'd the script. And changed my perspective from the world I dwell in to introspective. Greater is He that's in me, gotta be. Joy in the extreme, more than words can mean. Joy like a fountain some a' ya'll can't feel. Joy keeps me shoutin' somethin' ya'll can't steal. Sunshine or rain I retain my poise. Debris on the mic makin' joyful noise.     </segment7>
