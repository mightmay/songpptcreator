		<segment1>. In misery I can see, the bodies surrounding me. We slowly sterilize the treasures that we came to set free. Bolts in the the sky are the coming of death. The children scream as their families (are). Put to rest by the bullets spray</segment1>
		<segment2>I look around and I find. That there's no reason for this. How would pride give an offer that we can't resist *. Its not our job to protect. The world is suffocating. An instigator, is concentrating</segment2>
		<segment3>Where is the honor in the killing of an innocent son. I am a patriot alone with a helmet and gun. Its all inside, murder, without regard or regret. I am the slayer of the people whom I never have met</segment3>
		<segment4>I look around and I find. That there's no reason for this. How would pride give an offer that we can't resist *. Its not our job to protect. The world is suffocating. And instigator, is operating</segment4>
		<segment5>Now we lose control, I want to go it again. I cannot forget the bloody mess that I made. Its not my job to correct, I wonder has this claimed me. The instigator, is violating</segment5>
		<segment6>(we're all). Fear will take us all to the unknown. Forced to process all my thoughts blindly. My words will fall on deaf ears again. (no the won't accept it). Secrecy will keep me sworn to death</segment6>
		<segment7>I try, pretend, I can't forget. I close my eyes, I die inside. These scars, they stay. Don't go away. We killed the worst of the best. And we let God sort the rest. I try, pretend, I will forget. I close my eyes, I die inside. These scars, they stay. Don't go away. The instigator. Was made an enemy of me of me today.      </segment7>
