		<segment1>My eyes would say. That weve seen better days. And they cry. Its hard to stay. When I could run away. And close my eyes. But when theres no tomorrow. Youre telling me its alright. And when I feel sorrow. Youre telling me its alright. Theres so much to take. Feels like my heart could break. At any time. So invade this place. With Your lovely grace. So divine    </segment1>
