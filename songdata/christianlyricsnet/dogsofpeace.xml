		<segment1>Out on the mountain. The Shepherd is watching. Those running from all reason. We can help them see Him</segment1>
		<segment2>We can do our part. To change the hearts. Of everyone who's. Out there running. Storms are coming. Out there on your own. You call the Spirit. Angels hear it. The dogs of peace will guide you home</segment2>
		<segment3>We're merely servants. Bowed before the Master. Humbled that He'd choose us. We're amazed that He could use us</segment3>
		<segment4>To do our part. In changing hearts. Of everyone who's. Out there running. Storms are coming. Out there on your own. You call the Spirit. Angels hear it. The dogs of peace will guide you home</segment4>
		<segment5>We can do our parts. In changing hearts. Of everyone who's. Out there running. On your own. You call the Spirit. Angels hear it. The dogs of peace will guide you home.     </segment5>
