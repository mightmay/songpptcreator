		<segment1>Come a little closer, let's see if your legs still move, You can't live a full life, standing just outside the truth. Come and see what it's like, to have your weights removed, Come in and change your sinful heart, and it will be made new.</segment1>
		<segment2>Be made new.</segment2>
		<segment3>You didn't earn my love, no, no, no, no you never could, You didn't earn my love. You didn't earn my love, no, no, no, no you never could, You didn't earn my love.</segment3>
		<segment4>You may know already, that the healing comes duly, But this doesn't come for free, this is just the beginning. You got to let the roots grow deep, and stop worrying about the leaves, End of season they will be made new.</segment4>
		<segment5>Be made new.</segment5>
		<segment6>You didn't earn my love, no, no, no, no you never could, You didn't earn my love. You didn't earn my love, no, no, no, no you never could, You didn't earn my love.</segment6>
		<segment7>Live a life worthy of the calm in your head, Felt inside, you may not know the way but I, I do, but I do, When you choose, when you choose. I'll be ready for you.</segment7>
		<segment8>You didn't earn my love, no, no, no, (no you never could),</segment8>
		<segment9>You didn't earn my love. no, no, no, no you never could, You didn't earn my love, You didn't earn my love, no, no, You didn't earn my love.    </segment9>
