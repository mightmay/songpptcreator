		<segment1>If these old walls, If these old walls could speak. Of the things that they remember well, Stories and faces dearly held, A couple in love. Livin' week to week, Rooms full of laughter, If these walls could speak.</segment1>
		<segment2>If these old halls, If hallowed halls could talk, These would have a tale to tell. Of sun goin' down and dinner bell, And children playing at hide and seek. &gt;from floor to rafter, If these halls could speak.</segment2>
		<segment3>They would tell you that I'm sorry. For bein' cold and blind and weak. They would tell you that it's only. That I have a stubborn strreak, If these walls could speak. If these old fashioned window panes were eyes, I guess they would have seen it all--. Each little tear and sigh and footfall, And every dream that we came to seek. Or followed after, If these walls could speak.</segment3>
		<segment4>They would tell you that I owe you. More than I could ever pay. Here's someone who really loves you;. Don't ever go away. That's what these walls would say.</segment4>
		<segment5>They would tell you that I owe you. More than I could ever pay. Here's someone who really loves you;. Don't ever go away. That's what these walls would say.</segment5>
		<segment6>That's what these walls would say.</segment6>
		<segment7>That's what these walls would say.    </segment7>
