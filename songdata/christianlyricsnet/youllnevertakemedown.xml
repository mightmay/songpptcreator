		<segment1>You aint never gonna take me down. (so you see I ain't gonna break). Your never gonna take me down. (you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]</segment1>
		<segment2>They wanna see me gone they wanna see me crawl. They wanna shut me up untill I cant speak at all. They wont let me up they wanna see me fall. But it aint nothing cuz I done seen it all. Sometimes I feel like I cant breathe at all. I lie awake at night I cant sleep at all. I got no strength to fight I cant shake it off. But that's the time in my life when I hear you call. You say hold tight you say hold on. You say it's alright you say stand strong. Cuz my whole life I got a plan and all. So I don't worry about a single thing that happens y'all. Say what you want you can talk on. I'm a get on up and I'm a walk on. Now I ain't giving up until I'm long gone. So why don't you step it up bring it on y'all </segment2>
		<segment3>You aint never gonna take me down. (so you see I ain't gonna break). Your never gonna take me down. (you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]</segment3>
		<segment4>MTV said I was just a hater. Magazines said I was an imitator. The industry said nobody's gonna take ya. Record labels was like peace out see you later. I didn't need them man I just got. Someone to depend on when it gets hot. So VH1 you can talk all you wanna talk. Keep ya hip-hop and keep ya lip locked. I aint gonna listen now to them talk. I aint switching up and I aint gonna stop. I aint giving up and I aint gonna drop. Even when I just get stuck up in ruff spot. I aint got much but what I just got. You see it's more than I need when I just drop. To my knees and I can see that he shows up. You cant break me down that's some real talk </segment4>
		<segment5>You aint never gonna take me down. (so you see I ain't gonna break). Your never gonna take me down. (you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X]</segment5>
		<segment6>So what you gonna do when it falls apart. Who is the one man that you call upon. When everything that you know keeps going wrong. Plus you feel like you can't keep going on. See I know dukes your barely holding on. They wanna break you down but keep rolling on. They wanna take you down but don't let em y'all. They can't hold you now God's in control. Don't slow it down just walk it off. It aint easy I know sometimes its really hard. Please believe me I know you see I'm battle scarred. With my knees to the floor that how I battle on. Say what you want you can babble on. This I know what I got so I travel on. Don't ever stop that's why I wrote the song. So ready or not now bring the chorus on </segment6>
		<segment7>You aint never gonna take me down. (so you see I ain't gonna break). Your never gonna take me down. (you can't stop what you can't stop) [2X].     </segment7>
