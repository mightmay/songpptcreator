		<segment1>I've grown so tired of running circles around myself in search of something new. Only when I stood still I could see you were there. and you were waiting for me to fall in love with you</segment1>
		<segment2>Now I swear just on principle. With you near I feel like I'm invincible</segment2>
		<segment3>All that I've wanted is standing in front of me. All that I'll need that's for sure. You came to my bed when I was sick and you brought your cure</segment3>
		<segment4>Once I was frail. Now I have been repaired in all the lovely things you do. You do them so well. Come my dear. Let me hold you and soak in the love that we've made 'cause it's right on queue</segment4>
		<segment5>I rest in our citadel. At our best our love is so incredible</segment5>
		<segment6>All that I've wanted is standing in front of me. All that I'll need that's for sure. You came into my room when I was sick and you brought me the cure</segment6>
		<segment7>I was under the weather. But now I've pulled it together. So let me do what it takes to take care of you</segment7>
		<segment8>All that I've wanted is standing in front of me. All that I'll need that's for sure. You came into my room when I was sick and you made me yours</segment8>
		<segment9>All you could need and expect it will come from me. No one will ever love you more. You're in my world for good and our love will always be the cure    </segment9>
