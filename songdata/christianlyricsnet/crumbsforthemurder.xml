		<segment1>Take this breath in my chest. I crave death and nothing less. Slit my throat 'cuz I'm better off dead. My life has been wasted.</segment1>
		<segment2>Keep me around as if I had a purpose. I'm speaking out and proving that your wrong. The sweetest sound is when your voice is distant. I'm wanting out if that means taking you on.</segment2>
		<segment3>I've seen your breath written on these pages. You have bled for animals in cages. Was I given straw to build this house?. Tell me why the hell did my walls all fall down?</segment3>
		<segment4>Keep me around as if I had a purpose. I'm speaking out and proving that your wrong. The sweetest sound is when your voice is distant. I'm wanting out if that means taking you on, and now I'm taking off your crown.</segment4>
		<segment5>Take these hands and turn them into weapons. Change these plans and make them into your's. Take this man and turn his sight from demons. All I am is wanting you more.</segment5>
		<segment6>Now I see what's been hidden inside of me. I'll never question you again    </segment6>
