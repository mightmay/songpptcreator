		<segment1>This is the last of all the last times [x2]. My dear, no more [x3]. Where's the comfort?, where's the end? </segment1>
		<segment2>This is the last time. This is the last goodbye. You say that you're not sure. But I think you feel the same. Over and over we try to work this out. All this time all I wanted was you. All I want is you</segment2>
