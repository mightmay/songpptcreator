		<segment1>I'm lost at the end of my rope. And I'm burning, I'm yearning. I'm hurting for hope</segment1>
		<segment2>I'm needing this burden to go. But I'm searching for. Purpose, I'm searching to know</segment2>
		<segment3>It knocks me down to the floor. Till I'm pounding the ground. And I'm down in my hole</segment3>
		<segment4>It's got me down till I go. Till I cry out to you I. Can't take it no more</segment4>
		<segment5>You are the one that I hold. You are the one in my soul. You are the one that I know. That will come when I call. And I fall and I fold let's go. Cmon</segment5>
		<segment6>I'm at the end of my rope and. I can't take it no more. I think I'm losing control. I am about to let go</segment6>
		<segment7>I amÂ….</segment7>
		<segment8>So you said to let go. Let everything I had hold. Let go till its all in control. Let go till its gone up in smoke</segment8>
		<segment9>Crush me mold me make me. Stretch me fold me change me. Until I ain't just the same me. You the only one my safety. You are the one gonna saved me. And I don't wanna ever live safely. Destroy my world and take me. Past the end of my rope break me    </segment9>
