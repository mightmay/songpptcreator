		<segment1>You walk into your beautiful house. You stuff a steak in your beautiful mouth. You drive around in your big beautiful car. You blow your money on your beautiful hair. You think you're better cause you got more than me. You lose it all then who would you be. You're just a punk in a Mercedes Benz. You drive around to impress your friends. Taking me for a ride, Your bellies phat and you're ready for slaughter. You're bowing down to the all mighty dollar. Taking me for a ride..    </segment1>
