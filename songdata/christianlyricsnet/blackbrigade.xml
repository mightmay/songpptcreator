		<segment1>Prepare in urgency to race. Casting off the weight that burdens me. I cannot dare to force the pace. Marathon for life the road I face</segment1>
		<segment2>Committed. determined. My gaze is set on finishing</segment2>
		<segment3>Im straining to extend the lead. As every evil chases me. One day, one hour, every step</segment3>
		<segment4>I know. I know. I fix. my eyes. Ahead</segment4>
		<segment5>Straining on to run without remorse. Casting off mistakes that came before. In my mind I see a hallowed door. Open arm embrace, Im reaching for..</segment5>
		<segment6>Just like a breeze is passing me. My stammers, a distant memory. We cannot afford a glance to see. Whats gaining or what is history</segment6>
		<segment7>unyielding. unflinching. my gaze is set on finishing    </segment7>
