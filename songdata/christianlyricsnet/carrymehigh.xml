		<segment1>They laugh 'cause they see. I live for more than me. They point their fingers. Push me nearer to the flame. They say &quot;We serve no one. We just live to please ourselves&quot;. All men serve something..</segment1>
		<segment2>CHORUS: Father, carry me high, lift me to the sky. Let me be where You are. Hold me, ever so closely, let me know Your mercy. Let me be where You are</segment2>
		<segment3>They can laugh, but let them see. You are the hope in me. They can point their fingers. Push me nearer to the flame. God, You can save me from the fire. I'm Yours, even if You don't. Whatever comes, I take this vow. I will never bow..</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS</segment4>
		<segment5>I will never bow..</segment5>
		<segment6>Until you find something. Worth dying for. You're not really living. I will never bow</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS(2x)</segment7>
		<segment8>Father, carry me high, lift me to the sky. Let me be where You are. Father, carry me high, lift me to the sky. Let me be where You are</segment8>
		<segment9>I want to be where You are. I will never bow    </segment9>
