		<segment1>Spent too many hours holding up walls. standing in corners and clenching my jaw. watching you watching the ones that I wanted to be.</segment1>
		<segment2>Blaming this all on the moment. blaming this all on my views. blaming the mood of the music. blaming it all on you. All on you and me.</segment2>
		<segment3>Just because you said what you wanted. doesn't make it right. Just because the moment was heated. doesn't mean that I wanted to fight. And even though I saw your anger. even though I saw your face. the words that you cited were chosen. not fate, not spoken in haste.</segment3>
		<segment4>Well just for the moment, just one more time. just one more second and we'll be just fine. this could be just, just in case it's the last time. This could be the last time.</segment4>
		<segment5>Just until sundown, just one more day. I could hold you. Just until sundown, just one more day. I would hold you without you pushing me away.</segment5>
		<segment6>All on you and me.    </segment6>
