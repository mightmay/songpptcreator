		<segment1>Who am I that You would pay me mind?. Who am I that You would take the time to find me?. Who am I that You'd reach out your hand?. Lord what am I but just a sinful sinking man?. I didn't even know who God was, until He told me He's my Dad</segment1>
		<segment2>And it's just because He loved me. And He'd rather die than live without me. He loved me and He'd rather go through hell. Than go to Heaven without me. And I love Him and I'll stay with Him until the end of time. One thing I know-God gave His life for mine. He will always be, will always be. He will always be there!</segment2>
		<segment3>Who am I that You would know my name?. Who am I that You'd help me win this losing game?. Who am I that You'd stay all day by my side?. God I fail but at least you know I tried. I didn't even know who He was, Then God told me I'm His son!</segment3>
		<segment4>I count on God, I love Him best. He helps me through my trials and tests. He'll always be there when I call. Always catch me when I fall</segment4>
		<segment5>He will always be there!    </segment5>
