		<segment1>As you went to sleep tonight. Another notch in the headboard of life. Action, reaction, condition, decision, the easiest way to put an ending to your strife. Consequence burned conscience. delivered and signed for by a life. manufactured, destroyed. Scarred from death, memories left, cause and effect, unchangeable, emotional, regrettable, eternal case for life. Case for life, a self centered way out. Unwanted responsibility. Holocaust, and we're desensitized. No other decision has claimed so many lives. And I take this stand against your fight. to be called a fanatic and weak for being pro-life. For being crazy for wanting to save a life of a friend. or a wife that could be..my friend, my friend. and not just a piece of human waste that to you. was just a mistake. And I'm insane?    </segment1>
