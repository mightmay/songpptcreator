		<segment1>I saw you. And you saw me. And I didn't even know your name. Just one look. That was all it took. And I knew I'd never be the same. If walkin' on air compares to what I feel. Then how can I keep it sealed when..</segment1>
		<segment2>Chorus: I wanna tell the world. If the smile on my face. Hasn't given me away already. I wanna tell the world. There ain't no way to hide it. Your love has got me flyin' high. Since the day</segment2>
		<segment3>That you looked my way. I knew we were meant to be together. Now I thank the lord. For a love like yours. 'cause I know it's gonna last forever. It's hard to believe my dreams have all come true. And I'm so inlove with you that..</segment3>
		<segment4>(Chorus)</segment4>
		<segment5>I just want the world to know. Love has got me good to go. [i wanna tell the world, I wanna tell the world]. I have got to get it out. She is all I think about. [i wanna tell the world, I wanna tell the world]. It's something' that I need to say. Love has overtaken me</segment5>
