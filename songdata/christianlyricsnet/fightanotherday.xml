		<segment1>Its an uphill climb. But its all you know. So you spin your wheels. And dig your heels and down you go </segment1>
		<segment2>So predictable. But its not your fault. How can you expect to do your best. When youre scared to fall</segment2>
		<segment3>Cause the pain is real. But you will survive. Thats how you know youre alive</segment3>
		<segment4>Cause its Okay Now, Hey Now. You can let go. Thats when you. Find out, Find out. Everybody knows. That there just. Aint no, Aint no. Easier way out. I know it might not look that way. But Youre gonna live to fight another day</segment4>
		<segment5>Theres a place I know. Outside of town. Lets get out of here. Where all our fears dont hang around</segment5>
		<segment6>Heres another chance. Take it while you can. Cause it sure wont last. Moves so fast. And its gone again</segment6>
		<segment7>Pre-Chorus</segment7>
		<segment8>Chorus</segment8>
		<segment9>You wonder what you are made. Im telling you now. Youre gonna make somehow. What are you so afraid of.     </segment9>
