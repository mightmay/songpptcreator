		<segment1>You promised me. That Youd never leave. Or let me go. You promised me. That Youd love me through. The highs and lows</segment1>
		<segment2>You promised me. You wont give me more. Than I can bear. You promised me. That when I cry out. That Youd be there</segment2>
		<segment3>The shadowlands are what I know. So Im hanging on to Your every word. The shadowlands surround me now. But You walk with me through the cloud. Into the sun. Into the sun</segment3>
		<segment4>You promised me. If I sow in tears. Ill reap in joy. You promised me. That You will breathe life. Into my soul</segment4>
		<segment5>I know its true. All that You say. I believe in You. And I am standing on. The promises Youve made</segment5>
		<segment6>You promised me and I believe.     </segment6>
