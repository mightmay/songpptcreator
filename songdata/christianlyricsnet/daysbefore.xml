		<segment1>One became two and grew with you. Joy was in the air. The colours and the light were beautiful. We loved life and weren't scared</segment1>
		<segment2>You knew all we needed. &amp; You were all we needed then. Why'd we do it?. Turned our backs, no way back to  </segment2>
		<segment3>The days, days, days before it all went wrong. Days, days, days before, days before it all went wrong</segment3>
		<segment4>No heavy hearts, no criminals. No car pollution in the air. No need for sorrow,  no cause for pain. No regrets &amp; no more shame in   </segment4>
		<segment5>The days, days, days before it all went wrong. Days, days, days before, days before it all went wrong</segment5>
		<segment6>Oh when you gonna call. When you gonna come back. When you gonna make it. Changing everything &quot; every little thing. To the days before</segment6>
		<segment7>I know we lost it. We lost it all when we lost you. But I'm still waiting, and I'm. Holding on, holding on to</segment7>
		<segment8>The days, days, days before it all went wrong. Days, days, days before, days before it all went wrong</segment8>
		<segment9>Oh when you gonna call. Oh when you gonna come back. When you gonna make it. Changing everything &quot; every little thing. Yeah everybody's waiting. Everybody's watching. Ready once again, ready to return. To the days before</segment9>
