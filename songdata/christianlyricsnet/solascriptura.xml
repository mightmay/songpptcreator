		<segment1>Verse 1: Lately man its been some problems the scriptures have been under attack and thats crazy/ see Gods word is the final authority Im sorry theres no way you can sway cant persuade me/ the holy scriptures is the only sufficient certain and infallible rule for the Christian/ nothing can be added at all so you can keep your revelation and religious traditions/ the-op-nyoo-stos (theopneustus) its God breathed/ 2 Timothy 3:16/ because the scriptures are the only example of God breathed revelation in possession of the church/ they form the only infallible rule of faith for and which we base the church/ lets talk about inspiration/ Gods the author no mistaken man</segment1>
