		<segment1>You was a baby like I was once. You was cryin' in the early mornin'. You was born in a stable Lord. Reid Memorial is where I was born. They wrapped You in swaddling clothes. Me they dressed in baby blue</segment1>
		<segment2>I was twelve years old in the meeting house. Listening to the old men pray. And I was tryin' hard to figure out. What it was that they was tryin' to say. There You were in the temple. They said You weren't old enough. To know the things You knew</segment2>
		<segment3>Well, did You grow up hungry?. Did You grow up fast?. Did the little girls giggle when You walked past?. Did You wonder what it was. That made them laugh?</segment3>
		<segment4>CHORUS. Did they tell You stories. 'bout the saints of old?. Stories about their faith?. They say stories like that make a boy grow bold. Stories like that make a man walk straight</segment4>
		<segment5>You was a boy like I was once. But was You a boy like me. Well, I grew up around Indiana. You grew up around Galilee. And if I ever really do grow up. Lord I want to grow up and be just like You</segment5>
		<segment6>Did You wrestle with a dog and lick his nose?. Did You play beneath the spray. Of a water hose?. Did You ever make angels in the winter snow?</segment6>
		<segment7>CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>Did You ever get scared. Playing hide and seek?. Did You try not to cry. When You scraped Your knee?. Did You ever skip a rock across a quiet creek?</segment8>
		<segment9>CHORUS</segment9>
		<segment10>And I really may just grow up. And be like You someday    </segment10>
