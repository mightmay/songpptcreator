		<segment1>Can't find the time to clear my mind from all the stuff that's creeped inside. Untie the knots that clutter up the clarity of thought. Don't fight the things that you've been taught all your life. It's not what it seems that it's worth. It's always getting worse. Don't fight the things that you've been taught all your life. It's not what it seems that it's worth. It's always getting worse. Can't find the time to clear my mind from all the stuff that's creeped inside. Untie the knots that clutter up the clarity of thought. This sun is out and I'm on the floor and one more step, I'm out the door. I guess I should have stayed inside and given you the time.</segment1>
		<segment2>Don't fight the things that you've been taught all your life. It's not what it's worth. It's always getting worse.</segment2>
		<segment3>No one really wanted to see you. You know what I always wanted to be like you. I really do. If I could open up my eyes, I'd turn and run inside. ..I'd turn and run inside.</segment3>
