		<segment1>Well Brian and me well, We both agree that, That penny loafers are absurd, 'Cause I dont know why on earth, You would take yout two cents worth, And stick them in your girly shoes, And Dave replied well after all, Why not at least use quarters, So then you can make a phone call,</segment1>
		<segment2>Its finally time, time for our victory lap, Assemble the B, just one left turn, The matchbox tires spin out on the welcome mat, And the firemen are tired men, who cant put out the rug burn, And they say,</segment2>
		<segment3>Cut your hair short, then walk through an airport, So that you can dream of destinations. Cut your hair short, then walk through an airport, Cut your hair short, then walk through an airport, While all the while you're singing good vibrations,</segment3>
		<segment4>You're singing good vibrations. You're singing, good, good, good, good, vibrations. You're singing, good, good, good, good, vibrations. You're singing, good, good, good, good, we both agree. You're singing, good, good, good, good, mmm hmm hmm hmm.     </segment4>
