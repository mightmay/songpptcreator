		<segment1>Your faithfullness endures always. Where mountains fall and reason fails. And You calm the raging seas. And You calm the storms in me, again</segment1>
		<segment2>All I know is I find rest in You. All I know is I find rest in You</segment2>
		<segment3>My heart will praise throughout the night. Where singing seems a sacrifice. Your grace is all I need. Your grace is all I need    </segment3>
