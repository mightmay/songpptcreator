		<segment1>All I see inside is a longing for something that's outside. This understanding of the sun breaking open. And it shines over me, shines over me</segment1>
		<segment2>I can see the order in the way. That the oceans rise and roll out again. I can see the order in the way. That the flowers die to bloom again</segment2>
		<segment3>And I know that there is Something out there. Watching everything. I know there's Something out there. Even if I can't see. I know that there is Someone out there. Watching over me. I know there's Someone out there</segment3>
		<segment4>Silence in this night. A million ballads to something far from sight. With an unspoken name. And my reflection, image from some other time. Some other time</segment4>
		<segment5>Even though I can't see. The fingerprints are everywhere.     </segment5>
