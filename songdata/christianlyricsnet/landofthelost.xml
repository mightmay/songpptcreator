		<segment1>He lives out there somewhere. Beyond the land of the lost. I hate me when I find. That I laugh the most</segment1>
		<segment2>With no cares out in his chair. Just watching it all go by. He dances on occasion. On the roadside</segment2>
		<segment3>Why do people say. I think that he is strange and crazy, maybe. Someone's gotta give. And show him how to live today</segment3>
		<segment4>I can be the one.</segment4>
		<segment5>Here she comes, she's another one. With tangled hair, in need of love. She tries to hide her face. From everyone in every place</segment5>
		<segment6>Why do people say. I think that she is strange and crazy, maybe. Someone's gotta give and show her how to live. Today</segment6>
		<segment7>I can be the one..     </segment7>
