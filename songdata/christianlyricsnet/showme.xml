		<segment1>You could plant me like a tree beside a river. You could tangle me in soil and let my roots run wild. And I would blossom like a flower in the desert. But for now just let me cry</segment1>
		<segment2>You could raise me like a banner in a battle. Put victory like a fire behind my shining eyes. And I would drift like falling snow over the embers. But for now just let me lie</segment2>
		<segment3>Bind up these broken bones. Mercy bend and breathe me back to life. But not before You show me how to die</segment3>
		<segment4>Set me like a star before the morning. Like a song that steals the darkness from a world asleep. And I'll illuminate the path You've laid before me. But for now just let me be</segment4>
		<segment5>Bind up these broken bones. Mercy bend and breathe me back to life. But not before You show me how to die. Oh, not before You show me how to die</segment5>
		<segment6>So let me go like a leaf upon the water. Let me brave the wild currents flowing to the sea. And I will disappear into a deeper beauty. But for now just stay with me. God, for now just stay with me    </segment6>
