		<segment1>Behind the eyes of my compassion lies a suffering soul. And in my blood a bitter darkness slowly taking it's toll. I feel the death of our connection and the fading of light. Between the shards of sudden panic from choking on my life. . I see the scars of your addiction and the feeling you hide. A blackened heart from all the hatred you will never rewind. Within the depths of your depression hear you pleading for help. Your just a shell of vacant ruin, a portrait of myself. . I can't breathe alone. You can guide me home. . CHORUS: I am the face of your affliction. Feeding new life through the cracks in your skull. . Beneath the skin of your aggression is a thickening fear. A swelling plague from every devastating voice that you hear. You feel the throes of contradiction in the world that you left. Another day in your delusion, the never-ending death. . I can't breathe alone. You can guide me home. I can feel you here. You can draw me near. . CHORUS: I am the face of your afflication. Feeding new life through the cracks in your skull. I am the pain of your conviction. Stabbing you right through the back of your soul. . This is life, this is love. . (CHORUS). . I can feel you here. You can draw me near.    </segment1>
