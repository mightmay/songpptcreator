		<segment1>When the lights go up and the game is on. Are you ready for me?  Cause I'm ready for you. When the bell rings out and the fight is on. Are you ready for me? Cause I'm ready for you</segment1>
		<segment2>It's time for us to start throwing down. Take a look and see who's standing now</segment2>
		<segment3>Didn't even know that you and I were cross. Until a sneak attack from the weak side. Unaware that we were in a fight. I guess that's part of the problem, but guess what</segment3>
		<segment4>Say what you want to say about me. Throw up what you want to throw up at me. But when you mess with those that are around me. That's when you and I will have a problem</segment4>
		<segment5>I'm not afraid of loving my enemies. Turning the other cheek. Blessing those that would curse me. I honestly want peace with you. But when you come against my country. When you come against my family. You try to destroy my people. I can't just stand by. There's no way that I can stand by. This time, I will not stand by. I am coming, and if I come, then pain is coming with me. I'm coming, and pain will be with me.     </segment5>
