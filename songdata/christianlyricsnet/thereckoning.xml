		<segment1>Ride. I'm an outlaw taking chances when there's nothing left to gain. I get caught seeking answers that only cause me pain. Can't let my eyes get branded, so I can find my way. I'll ride like a runaway bandit, cause I found that I'm to blame</segment1>
		<segment2>Time keeps changing, but the story's the same. Why do we all keep looking for somebody to blame?. The score needs settled, but this isn't a game. So win, lose, or die. We ride. This is the reckoning</segment2>
		<segment3>I'm a renegade livin'on the edge, and you're the one who lives afraid. I keep on turning the pages, you keep on running away. I'm a young gun shootin' to payback, here comes the ricochet. I see Wanted: dead or alive. On the page, I see my face</segment3>
		<segment4>What good is the cure without the disease?.     </segment4>
