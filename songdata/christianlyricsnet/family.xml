		<segment1>vs1. Hes on the run from a bad break. His soles are worn down to the skin. Hes got the scars of a heartache. So you can see everywhere hes been</segment1>
		<segment2>And where he was he was the only one. So he went looking for his mothers son</segment2>
		<segment3>ch. And with my family around me now. It takes me to a new place. When my family surrounds me now. You see it on my face</segment3>
		<segment4>vs2. But his own people didnt know him. They couldnt take the bad with the good. Theres just so much he couldnt show them. It left him sneaking round the neighborhood</segment4>
		<segment5>He just wanted to be known and loved. And sometimes flesh and blood is not enough</segment5>
		<segment6>bridge. Whos my sister, whos my brother. Whos my father, who is my mother. Those who I cannot sell anything. Those who cannot buy my love</segment6>
