		<segment1>I cannot live without You, my Lord. I	cannot	live	without You. Left to myself I know not where to turn. I cannot live without You. Without Your touch in my life. Without Your voice in my ear. Without Your songs in my heart. Lord, I cannot live. I cannot live without You. I cannot live without You. Tied to the earth by this veil of flesh. struggling to remember all You teach me. Tethered to Your heart by the blood. You shed trusting that Your Love will never leave me.. Without Your touch in my life. Without Your voice in my ear. Without Your songs in my heart. Lord, I cannot live. I	cannot	live	without You. I	cannot	live	without You    </segment1>
