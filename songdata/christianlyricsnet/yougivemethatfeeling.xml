		<segment1>How many words are there to say?. But I still can't find a way. To tell you how you've captured me. And turned it all around. I want to write it down. I need to say it out loud. This force inside is driving me. And I can't hold it in. I know You're the only one. Who could help me finally open up. You created something new in me</segment1>
		<segment2>You give me that feeling. A power I can believe in. The world around me disappears. (I know I'm completely changed). You give me that feeling. I could smash straight through the ceiling. Fly until I reach the sun. (The ties that bind me come undone). You give me that feeling</segment2>
		<segment3>Your light, it shines so bright. It makes the day seem like the night. You chase away the shadows. And illuminate my path. I know You're the only one. Who could help me finally open up. You created something new in me</segment3>
		<segment4>I always thought if someone knew the real me. They would turn away. But now I've found Your love completes me. And I'll never be the same    </segment4>
