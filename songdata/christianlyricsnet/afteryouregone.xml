		<segment1>I could not lie. Skin untouched growing thicker for every step unwalked. And I don't know if it's the cold intention-slide. Taking me down</segment1>
		<segment2>But what if You'd sing me alive. I'm ready to give up the fight. Cause I'm just a stone. Right after You're gone</segment2>
		<segment3>I could not lie. Even though dead skin like stone makes me ugly. It still pounds inside and it's red. And it's slipping through the grey cracks. And I know You know</segment3>
		<segment4>But what if You'd sing me alive. I'm ready to give up the fight. Cause I'm just a stone. Right after You're gone</segment4>
		<segment5>The first thing that meets the eye. When I crossover into the light. I want it to be You. Right after I'm gone    </segment5>
