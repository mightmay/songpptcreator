		<segment1>It's not my problem anymore. You see it never really was. So you can stop caring as you call it. And I'll be fine right here </segment1>
		<segment2>You see that I can play a pretty convincing role. So I don't need you. I don't think I need you </segment2>
		<segment3>But you see through my forever lies. And you are not believing. And I see in your forever eyes. That you are forever healing </segment3>
		<segment4>You can't hear what I'm not saying. And I can hold out long enough. Treading water, I keep from sinking. Cause I'm not one for reaching </segment4>
		<segment5>You see that I can play a pretty convincing role. So I don't need you. I don't think I need you </segment5>
		<segment6>But you see through my forever lies. And you are not believing. And I see in your forever eyes. That you are forever healing </segment6>
		<segment7>Deny myself, deny my heart. Deny your hand, deny your hand. Oh but you offered me eternity, but why should I buy that </segment7>
		<segment8>You see that I can play a pretty convincing role. So I don't need you. I don't think I need you    </segment8>
