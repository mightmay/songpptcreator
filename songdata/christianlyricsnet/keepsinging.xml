		<segment1>Another rainy day. I can't recall having sunshine on my face. All I feel is pain. All I wanna do is walk out of this place. But when I am stuck and I can't move. When I don't know what I should do. When I wonder if I'll ever make it through</segment1>
		<segment2>I gotta keep singing. I gotta keep praising Your name. Your the one that's keeping my heart beating. I gotta keep singing. I gotta keep praising Your name. That's the only way that I'll find healing</segment2>
		<segment3>Can I climb up in Your lap. I don't wanna leave. Jesus sing over me. I gotta keep singing</segment3>
		<segment4>Can I climb up in Your lap. I don't wanna leave. Jesus sing over me. I gotta keep singing</segment4>
		<segment5>Oh You're everything I need. And I gotta keep singing    </segment5>
