		<segment1>&quot;Young people. Welcome to the.. heaven.. .. and ministry tonight. Won't you please turn in your hymnals to page 333. Sister Mildred, we're gonna play free at last. Free at last, thank God almighty&quot;</segment1>
		<segment2>Free at last, free at last. I thank God I'm free at last. Free at last, free at last. I thank God I'm free at last</segment2>
		<segment3>&quot;Clap your hands&quot;</segment3>
		<segment4>Free, free, I'm free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free at last. Free, free, I'm free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free</segment4>
		<segment5>Cause I'm free, free at last. And I'm free, from my past, and I'm free. Free from sin, and I'm free. And I ain't going back again</segment5>
		<segment6>Shackles had me down but He gave me a new sound. So reclaim my name from the lost and found. Ya see, something's got me jumpin'. And I think it's the way. That He can take a hard man. And turn him into soft clay. Out of the darkness, the Father has sparked this. The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass. If you're seriously curious about my past. Well I once was lost but I'm free at last!</segment6>
		<segment7>Free, free, I'm free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free at last. Free, free, I'm free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free</segment7>
		<segment8>Cause I'm free, free at last. And I'm free, from my past, and I'm free. Free from sin, and I'm free. And I ain't going back again</segment8>
		<segment9>Oppression was in session and my life was the term. But when I heard about the Word I was willing to learn. About a flavor I could savor and a brighter tomorrow. Cause this could never be endeavored by a wish on a star. The Father first receives us, the Truth then frees us. Forgiven, now I'm living like a man full of Jesus. It was hell until I fell upon my knees and prayed. But now the yoke that I was totin' has been taken away</segment9>
		<segment10>Free, free, I'm free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free at last. Free, free, I'm free at last. Thank God Almighty I'm free</segment10>
		<segment11>Cause I'm free, free at last, free. From my past, free from sin, and I'm free. And down on my knees when my life passed me by. And I ain't, no I ain't going back again</segment11>
		<segment12>F R to the E E. L A to the S T. Out of the darkness, the Father has sparked this. The spirit's alive while the flesh is a carcass. If you're seriously curious about my past. Well I was once lost but I'm free at last</segment12>
		<segment13>I'm here to tell you what he did for me and. I'm here to tell you that he set me free and. I know that He can do the same for you, too. He did it, I'm wit it, so come and get it. Be free at last!</segment13>

		<segment15>Cause I'm free, free at last. And I'm free, from my past, and I'm free. Free from sin, and I'm free. And I ain't going back again</segment15>
		<segment16>When all of God's children: black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics. Will be able to join hands and. Sing in the words of the old negro spiritual..</segment16>
