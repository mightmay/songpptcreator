		<segment1>So what if you don't like me?. Underneath our skin we still bleed. I can deal with your sarcasm. It takes more than that to put me under your thumb. You think I'll follow you down. I'm not as dumb as you think. You think I'll follow you down. You'll never see me break. You must think that you are better. Just accept that we are all the same. What do I do to make you hate me?. It doesn't matter, I'll turn the other cheek. I'm not as dumb as you think. I won't make the same mistakes you have. Feeble minded, black hearted. Your widened mouth and simple ideals.    </segment1>
