		<segment1>O for grace to trust. O for strength to love. O to cast my cares down at your feet. O for feet to dance. O for a heart to romance. O for lungs to lift your name so high</segment1>
		<segment2>My hands go up, giving you glory. I just can't get enough. You are so worthy, Lord. I'll keep pouring it out for you. My cup is overflowing. With your perfect love. You're all I'm longing for. I'll keep pouring it out for you</segment2>
		<segment3>O for faith to rise. O my soul come alive. O my God You are all I need. O for feet to dance. O for a heart to romance. O for lungs to lift your name so high</segment3>
		<segment4>My heart and flesh they cry out holy. Jesus be my one and only joy    </segment4>
