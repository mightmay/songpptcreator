		<segment1>If I gain the world, do I have any more to give than all of me. When my all is nothing more than this. We're all the same, and in my Father's eyes He sees. Our every we bring to him. CHORUS. What have I got to lose. What have I got to give. When am I gonna choose. How I'm gonna live. When am I going to see. Without you I'm nothing. You're everything. And if I give more of me than I have to give. You're so much more, much more in me than I'm on my own. So make me pure, make me sure that all I have, all I give is all for You. I give You all of me(3x)    </segment1>
