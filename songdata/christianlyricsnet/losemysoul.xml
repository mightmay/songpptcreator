		<segment1>Father God, I am clay in your hands. Help me to stay that way through all life's demands. 'Cause they chip and they nag and they pull at me. And every little thing I make up my mind to be</segment1>
		<segment2>Like I'm gonna be a daddy whose in the mix. And I'm gonna be a husband who stays legit. And I pray that I'm an artist who rises above the road that is wide and filled with self love. Everything that I see draws me. Though its only in You that I can truly see that its a feast for the eyes - a low blow to purpose. And I'm a little kid at a three ring circus</segment2>
		<segment3>I don't want to gain the whole world and lose my soul. Don't wanna walk away let me hear the people say. I don't want to gain the whole world and lose my soul. Don't wanna walk away let me hear the people say</segment3>
		<segment4>The paparazzi flashes and that they think that it's you. But they don't know that who you are is not what you do. True, we get it twisted when we peak at the charts. Yo before we part from the start where's your heart?. You're a pimp, hustler?. Tell me what's your title. America has no more stars now we call them idols. You sit idle. While we teach prosperity. The first thing to prosper should be inside of me. We're free .. Not because of 22's the a range. But Christ came in range we said yes now we changed. Not the same even though I made a fall. Since I got that call no more Saul now I'm Paul</segment4>
		<segment5>How do I sense the tide that's rising?. De-sensitizing me from living in light of eternity. How do I sense the tide that's rising?. It's hypnotizing me from living in light of eternity.     </segment5>
