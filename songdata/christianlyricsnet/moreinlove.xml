		<segment1>Every day, every day I will live for. For the One who has come as my Savior. Living loud, here and now. I will shout Your fame. Evermore, evermore Ill adore You. Thankful for every door that I break through. In the trials and the smiles. I will give You praise</segment1>
		<segment2>You mean more than every breath and. You free me with every step and. . .</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS. You heal my broken heart and. Thats why I keep on falling more in love. More in love. You take me where You are and. Thats why I keep on falling more in love. So much more in love with You</segment3>
		<segment4>Bridge. You are the sun light. You are the falling rain. You are the mountains. You always stay the same. Stay the same</segment4>
