		<segment1>Be still, there is a healer. His love is deeper than the sea. His mercy, it is unfailing. His arms are a fortress for the weak</segment1>
		<segment2>Let faith arise. Let faith arise</segment2>
		<segment3>I lift my hands to believe again. You are my refuge, You are my strength. As I pour out my heart, these things I remember. You are faithful, God, forever</segment3>
		<segment4>Be still, there is a river. That flows from Calvary's tree. A fountain for the thirsty. Pure grace that washes over me</segment4>
		<segment5>So let faith arise. Let faith arise. Open my eyes. Open my eyes</segment5>
		<segment6>I lift my hands to believe again. You are my refuge, You are my strength. As I pour out my heart, these things I remember. You are faithful, God. You are faithful, God, forever    </segment6>
