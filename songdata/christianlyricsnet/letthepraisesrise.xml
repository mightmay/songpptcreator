		<segment1>There's a sound being released, to the north and the south, west and the east, the earth is calling out, for the heavens to come down, oh there's a song circulating, written in every language to every nation, the earth is calling out, for the heavens to come down, Oh i can feel the ground is shaking beneath my feet, creations waking, dying to redeem this generation..Let the praises rise, all creation sing, let the rain from heaven fall, harvesting the planted seeds, let the oceans tides, pray and prophecy, never ending waves of healing, never ending waves of life..With open hands and broken hearts, we will declare your awesome love, so we can stand and we can know, the king of kings..    </segment1>
