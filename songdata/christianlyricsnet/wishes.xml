		<segment1>Wishes. The saddest thing is you could be anything that you could want. We could have been everything. But now were not. Now its not anything at all</segment1>
		<segment2>The hardest part was getting this close to you. And giving up this dream I built with you. A fairytale that isnt coming true. Youve got some growing up to do</segment2>
		<segment3>CHORUS: I wish we could have worked it out. I wish I didnt have these doubts. I wish I didnt have to wonder just what you are doing now</segment3>
		<segment4>I wish I didnt know inside. That it wont work out for you and I. I wish that I could stop this wishing. And just say my last goodbye</segment4>
		<segment5>After all the things you put me through. Tell me why Im still in love with you. And why am I, why am I still waiting for your call</segment5>
		<segment6>You broke my heart. Im taking it back from you. Im taking back the life that I gave to you. Life goes on before and after you. Ive got some growing up to do. CHORUS</segment6>
		<segment7>Its time I said my last goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Its time I said my last goodbye. CHORUS</segment7>
		<segment8>Its time I said my last goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Its time I said my last goodbye    </segment8>
