		<segment1>These lights are gone. My ears hear no sound. Folding between the skin and bone. We will hear and know. Folding back our ears and slow grows our heart searching for, searching for. Searching for the sound. The secret in your eyes. Is your voice dead to me? Or just too far away? Searching for the sound. Im listening. When scenery is taken. These lights are gone. My ears hear no sound. Folding between the skin and bone. Skin and bone. Searching for the sound. The secret in your eyes. Is your voice dead to me? Or just too far away? Searching for the sound. Im listening. When scenery is taken.     </segment1>
