		<segment1>I thought I heard your voice. Last night. Carried on the wind, Singing lines from old songs, Calling out all our names again. </segment1>
		<segment2>I would have followed you. All the way back home. To where our lives were long. As bending rivers in the sun. </segment2>
		<segment3>Sweet Grace, mi alma Linda, I sing this song for you. Sweet Grace, And I imagine Heaven singing too, Singing out for you. </segment3>
		<segment4>I dream of your adobe house. Small beneath the stars -. The river and the silver moon. Behind the crumbling barn. </segment4>
		<segment5>I dream of beaded necklaces. Sparkling on your skin, The aspens turning golden. In the gray September rain. </segment5>
		<segment6>Sweet Grace, These memories bring me. Close to you once more, Your stories and your gentle laughter. Calling from your door. </segment6>
		<segment7>Sweet Grace, mi alma Linda, I sing this song for you, And I imagine Heaven singing, Angels dancing too, Dancing right along with you. Dancing along with you. </segment7>
		<segment8>I dream of the. Golden melting sunlight. The blue and silver moon. Sweet Grace, sweet Grace </segment8>
		<segment9>I thought I heard your voice. Last night. Call your children home. Sweet Grace    </segment9>
