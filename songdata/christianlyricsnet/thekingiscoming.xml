		<segment1>Empty hearts are filling up. Wicked ways are coming undone. Every eye is looking out for You. City lights are burning out. Freedom's song is ringing loud. Dead men waking up to the sound of You. And all our hearts can sing. All our hearts can sing is</segment1>
		<segment2>. Make a way for. Make a way for. Make a way for the King. The King is coming</segment2>
		<segment3>Split the sky with your glory. Bring to life an awakening. Burn away everything that's not for You. Hear our voices crying out. We wont stop til heaven's come down. We wont stop til every knee bows to You. And all our hearts will sing is</segment3>
		<segment4>BRIDGE. Open up the doors. Open up the doors. Lift your eyes to see. Our King is coming    </segment4>
