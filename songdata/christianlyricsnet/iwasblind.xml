		<segment1>I love your ways. They are beautiful. so beautiful to me. Your mystery. How you know me, yet you love me. Your kindness, it brings me to my knees. Your kindness, it leads me to say sorry</segment1>
		<segment2>I was blind, but now I see. I was broken but you carried me. I was lost, but now I'm found. I was guilty but you turned me around</segment2>
		<segment3>I love your ways. They are beautiful. so beautiful to me. I love your mystery. How you trust me yet you know me. Your kindness, it brings me to my knees. Your kindness, it leads me to say sorry</segment3>
