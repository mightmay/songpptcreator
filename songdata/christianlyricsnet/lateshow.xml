		<segment1>You get my so simply. But my heart won't let me</segment1>
		<segment2>I won't forget that night I saw her at the movies. She has this way about her, she smiles whenever she walks. I'm trying to find the nerve to finally introduce me. She had this glow about her you'd catch whenever she talks</segment2>
		<segment3>Let's go, knocking on my window. We can watch the last show. And movies made for cable. And then we'll talk, listening to punk rock. We'll hang out and wait up. Until the sun comes up</segment3>
